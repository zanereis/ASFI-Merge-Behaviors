for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR is to add two more metrics for `ObjectHashAggregateExec`, i.e. the spill size, and number of fallback to sort-based aggregation.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAs object hash aggregate fallback mechanism is special - it will fallback to sort-based aggregation based on number of keys seen so far [0]. This fallback logic sometimes is sub-optimal and leads to unnecessary sort, and performance degradation in run-time. The first step to help user/developer debug is to add more related metrics on UI, e.g. spill size, and number of fallback to sort-based aggregation. (spill size metrics was already added for hash aggregate [1])\r\n\r\n[0]: https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/aggregate/ObjectAggregationIterator.scala#L161 \r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/aggregate/HashAggregateExec.scala#L68 \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nAdded two more metrics on Spark UI for operator `ObjectHashAggregateExec`. Screenshot is attached below.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n* Added unit test in `SQLMetricsSuite.scala`.\r\n* Tested on spark shell locally and verified the metrics shown up on UI.\r\n\r\n<img

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n`TreeNodeException` causes the error msg not clear and it didn't work well.\r\nBecause the `TreeNodeException` looks redundancy, we could remove it.\r\n\r\nThere are show a case:\r\n```\r\nval df = Seq((\"1\", 1), (\"1\", 2), (\"2\", 3), (\"2\", 4)).toDF(\"x\", \"y\")\r\nval hashAggDF = df.groupBy(\"x\").agg(c, sum(\"y\"))\r\n```\r\nThe above code will use `HashAggregateExec`. In order to ensure that an exception will be thrown when executing `HashAggregateExec`, I added `throw new RuntimeException(\"calculate error\")` into https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/72b7f8abfb60d0008f1f9bed94ce1c367a7d7cce/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/aggregate/HashAggregateExec.scala#L85\r\n\r\nSo, if the above code

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nImprove the error messages for incompatibilities between Avro and Catalyst schemas. First, make `AvroSerializer` more similar to `AvroDeserializer` in printing out contextual information such as hierarchical field names. Standardize exception messages in both serializer and deserializer to always include such contextual information, and include a top-level exception which shows the full schemas which were being parsed when the incompatibility was found. Both now print out the hierarchical name for both the Avro and Catalyst fields, since they may be different due to case sensitivity and Avro union handling.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe error messages in this type of failure scenario are very lacking in information on the write path (`AvroSerializer`). Below are two examples of messages that provide insufficient information to determine what went wrong (lacking in field names, context about the overall schema structure, etc.).\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.avro.IncompatibleSchemaException: Cannot convert Catalyst type IntegerType to Avro type \"float\".\r\n\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.avro.IncompatibleSchemaException: Cannot convert Catalyst type StructType(StructField(bar,IntegerType,true)) to Avro type {\"type\":\"record\",\"name\":\"test\",\"fields\":[{\"name\":\"NOTbar\",\"type\":[\"null\",\"int\"],\"default\":null}]}.\r\n```\r\nThe error messages currently existing in `AvroDeserializer` are much better, but still not very internally consistent, and it would be better if they were consistent with the newly added exception messages in `AvroSerializer`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nError messages when there are incompatibilities between Avro and Catalyst schemas will be greatly improved on when writing Avro data using the `avroSchema` option, a little bit improved when reading Avro data, and much more consistent between the two.\r\n\r\nBelow is an example of a new message. See `AvroSerdeSuite` for more examples.\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.avro.IncompatibleSchemaException: Cannot convert Catalyst type STRUCT<`foo`: STRUCT<`bar`: INT>> to Avro type {\"type\":\"record\",\"name\":\"top\",\"fields\":[{\"name\":\"foo\",\"type\":\"int\"}]}\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.avro.AvroSerializer.liftedTree1$1(AvroSerializer.scala:83)\r\n...\r\nCaused by: org.apache.spark.sql.avro.IncompatibleSchemaException: Cannot convert Catalyst field 'foo' to Avro field 'foo' because schema is incompatible (sqlType = STRUCT<`bar`: INT>, avroType = \"int\")\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.avro.AvroSerializer.newConverter(AvroSerializer.scala:230)\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew unit test suite, `AvroSerdeSuite`, was added to test corner cases on `AvroSerializer` and `AvroDeserializer` and verify that the exception messages are as expected. Existing tests in `AvroSuite` also continue to pass, with modifications in places where assertions were made about the exceptions that would be

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nChange `AvroSuite.\"Ignore corrupt Avro file if flag IGNORE_CORRUPT_FILES\"` to use `episodesAvro`, which is loaded as a resource using the classloader, instead of trying to read `episodes.avro` directly from a relative file path.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis is the proper way to read resource files, and currently this test will fail when called from my IntelliJ IDE, though it will succeed when called from Maven/sbt, presumably due to different working directory handling.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, unit test only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPrevious failure from IntelliJ:\r\n```\r\nSource 'src/test/resources/episodes.avro' does not exist\r\njava.io.FileNotFoundException: Source 'src/test/resources/episodes.avro' does not exist\r\n\tat org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils.checkFileRequirements(FileUtils.java:1405)\r\n\tat

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch uses the available offset range obtained during polling Kafka records to do offset validation check.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWe support non-consecutive offsets for Kafka since 2.4.0. In `fetchRecord`, we do offset validation by checking if the offset is in available offset range. But currently we obtain latest available offset range to do the check. It looks not correct as the available offset range could be changed during the batch, so the available offset range is different than the one when we polling the records from Kafka.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that an offset is valid when polling, but at the time we do the above check, it is out of latest available offset range. We will wrongly consider it as data loss case and fail the query or drop the record.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis should pass existing unit tests.\r\n\r\nThis is hard to have unit test as the Kafka producer and the consumer is asynchronous. Further, we also need to make the offset out of new available offset range.","created_at":"2021-01-25T21:33:36Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:56:51Z","closed_at":"2021-01-25T22:30:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7689603137e49d034f7839cef6cb6d075bb9e2ce","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31330/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31330/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31330/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c5b9e12a2d1381cbadcb4adba0609b51a0979b2e","head":{"label":"viirya:SPARK-34187-2.4","ref":"SPARK-34187-2.4","sha":"c5b9e12a2d1381cbadcb4adba0609b51a0979b2e","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to fix Avro data source to use the decimal precision and scale of file schema.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe decimal value should be interpreted with its original precision and scale. Otherwise, it returns incorrect result like the following. The schema mismatch happens when we use `userSpecifiedSchema` or there are multiple files with inconsistent schema or HiveMetastore schema is updated by the user.\r\n```scala\r\nscala> sql(\"SELECT 3.14 a\").write.format(\"avro\").save(\"/tmp/avro\")\r\nscala> spark.read.schema(\"a DECIMAL(4, 3)\").format(\"avro\").load(\"/tmp/avro\").show\r\n+-----+\r\n|    a|\r\n+-----+\r\n|0.314|\r\n+-----+ \r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, this will return correct result.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CI with the newly added test

For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWe support non-consecutive offsets for Kafka since 2.4.0. In `fetchRecord`, we do offset validation by checking if the offset is in available offset range. But currently we obtain latest available offset range to do the check. It looks not correct as the available offset range could be changed during the batch, so the available offset range is different than the one when we polling the records from Kafka.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that an offset is valid when polling, but at the time we do the above check, it is out of latest available offset range. We will wrongly consider it as data loss case and fail the query or drop the record.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis should pass existing unit tests.\r\n\r\nThis is hard to have unit test as the Kafka producer and the consumer is asynchronous. Further, we also need to make the offset out of new available offset range.","created_at":"2021-01-25T18:51:09Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:24:45Z","closed_at":"2021-01-25T19:59:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bdeababdd233ad2e27b75dede43380dc00da450c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31328/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31328/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31328/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3cd8d78f50ebb45d6eef9d277d4c93c76d869236","head":{"label":"viirya:SPARK-34187-3.0","ref":"SPARK-34187-3.0","sha":"3cd8d78f50ebb45d6eef9d277d4c93c76d869236","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to convert `null` partition values to `\"__HIVE_DEFAULT_PARTITION__\"` before storing in the `In-Memory` catalog internally. Currently, the `In-Memory` catalog maintains null partitions as `\"__HIVE_DEFAULT_PARTITION__\"` in file system but as `null` values in memory that could cause some issues like in SPARK-34203.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n`InMemoryCatalog` stores partitions in the file system in the Hive compatible form, for instance, it converts the `null` partition value to `\"__HIVE_DEFAULT_PARTITION__\"` but at the same time it keeps null as is internally. That causes an issue demonstrated by the example below:\r\n```\r\n$ ./bin/spark-shell -c spark.sql.catalogImplementation=in-memory\r\n```\r\n```scala\r\nscala> spark.conf.get(\"spark.sql.catalogImplementation\")\r\nres0: String = in-memory\r\n\r\nscala> sql(\"CREATE TABLE tbl (col1 INT, p1 STRING) USING parquet PARTITIONED BY (p1)\")\r\nres1: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = []\r\n\r\nscala> sql(\"INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE tbl VALUES (0, null)\")\r\nres2: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = []\r\n\r\nscala> sql(\"ALTER TABLE tbl DROP PARTITION (p1 = null)\")\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.analysis.NoSuchPartitionsException: The following partitions not found in table 'tbl' database 'default':\r\nMap(p1 -> null)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.catalog.InMemoryCatalog.dropPartitions(InMemoryCatalog.scala:440)\r\n```  \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. After the changes, `ALTER TABLE .. DROP PARTITION` can drop the `null` partition in `In-Memory` catalog:\r\n```scala\r\nscala> spark.table(\"tbl\").show(false)\r\n+----+----+\r\n|col1|p1  |\r\n+----+----+\r\n|0   |null|\r\n+----+----+\r\n\r\n\r\nscala> sql(\"ALTER TABLE tbl DROP PARTITION (p1 = null)\")\r\nres4: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = []\r\n\r\nscala> spark.table(\"tbl\").show(false)\r\n+----+---+\r\n|col1|p1 |\r\n+----+---+\r\n+----+---+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new test to `DDLSuite`:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly *CatalogedDDLSuite\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nAuthored-by: Max Gekk <max.gekk@gmail.com>\r\nSigned-off-by: Wenchen Fan <wenchen@databricks.com>\r\n(cherry picked from commit

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nCheck `RepartitionOperation` child max row.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIt's no meaning to repartition data if partition number is larger than data row, but would waste the resouce due to redundant task.\r\n\r\nWith ETL case, we always inject `repartition` or `distribute by` to reduce the output partition but the partition number may bigger than data row. It's better that try our best to reduce the redundant partition.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to convert `null` partition values to `\"__HIVE_DEFAULT_PARTITION__\"` before storing in the `In-Memory` catalog internally. Currently, the `In-Memory` catalog maintains null partitions as `\"__HIVE_DEFAULT_PARTITION__\"` in file system but as `null` values in memory that could cause some issues like in SPARK-34203.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n`InMemoryCatalog` stores partitions in the file system in the Hive compatible form, for instance, it converts the `null` partition value to `\"__HIVE_DEFAULT_PARTITION__\"` but at the same time it keeps null as is internally. That causes an issue demonstrated by the example below:\r\n```\r\n$ ./bin/spark-shell -c spark.sql.catalogImplementation=in-memory\r\n```\r\n```scala\r\nscala> spark.conf.get(\"spark.sql.catalogImplementation\")\r\nres0: String = in-memory\r\n\r\nscala> sql(\"CREATE TABLE tbl (col1 INT, p1 STRING) USING parquet PARTITIONED BY (p1)\")\r\nres1: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = []\r\n\r\nscala> sql(\"INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE tbl VALUES (0, null)\")\r\nres2: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = []\r\n\r\nscala> sql(\"ALTER TABLE tbl DROP PARTITION (p1 = null)\")\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.analysis.NoSuchPartitionsException: The following partitions not found in table 'tbl' database 'default':\r\nMap(p1 -> null)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.catalog.InMemoryCatalog.dropPartitions(InMemoryCatalog.scala:440)\r\n```  \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. After the changes, `ALTER TABLE .. DROP PARTITION` can drop the `null` partition in `In-Memory` catalog:\r\n```scala\r\nscala> spark.table(\"tbl\").show(false)\r\n+----+----+\r\n|col1|p1  |\r\n+----+----+\r\n|0   |null|\r\n+----+----+\r\n\r\n\r\nscala> sql(\"ALTER TABLE tbl DROP PARTITION (p1 = null)\")\r\nres4: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = []\r\n\r\nscala> spark.table(\"tbl\").show(false)\r\n+----+---+\r\n|col1|p1 |\r\n+----+---+\r\n+----+---+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new test to `AlterTableDropPartitionSuiteBase`:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive-2.3 -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to the correctness issues during reading decimal values from Parquet files.\r\n- For **MR** code path, `ParquetRowConverter` can read Parquet's decimal values with the original precision and scale written in the corresponding footer.\r\n- For **Vectorized** code path, `VectorizedColumnReader` throws `SchemaColumnConvertNotSupportedException`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently, Spark returns incorrect results when the Parquet file's decimal precision and scale are different from the Spark's schema. This happens when there is multiple files with different decimal schema or HiveMetastore has a new schema.\r\n\r\n**BEFORE (Simplified example for correctness)**\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nscala> sql(\"SELECT 1.0 a\").write.parquet(\"/tmp/decimal\")\r\nscala> spark.read.schema(\"a DECIMAL(3,2)\").parquet(\"/tmp/decimal\").show\r\n+----+\r\n|   a|\r\n+----+\r\n|0.10|\r\n+----+\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis works correctly in the other data sources, `ORC/JSON/CSV`, like the following.\r\n```scala\r\nscala> sql(\"SELECT 1.0 a\").write.orc(\"/tmp/decimal_orc\")\r\nscala> spark.read.schema(\"a DECIMAL(3,2)\").orc(\"/tmp/decimal_orc\").show\r\n+----+\r\n|   a|\r\n+----+\r\n|1.00|\r\n+----+\r\n```\r\n\r\n**AFTER**\r\n1. **Vectorized** path: Instead of incorrect result, we will raise an explicit exception.\r\n```scala\r\nscala> spark.read.schema(\"a DECIMAL(3,2)\").parquet(\"/tmp/decimal\").show\r\njava.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: Schema evolution not supported.\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. **MR** path (complex schema or explicit configuration): Spark returns correct results.\r\n```scala\r\nscala> spark.read.schema(\"a DECIMAL(3,2), b DECIMAL(18, 3), c MAP<INT,INT>\").parquet(\"/tmp/decimal\").show\r\n+----+-------+--------+\r\n|   a|      b|       c|\r\n+----+-------+--------+\r\n|1.00|100.000|{1 -> 2}|\r\n+----+-------+--------+\r\n\r\nscala> spark.read.schema(\"a DECIMAL(3,2), b DECIMAL(18, 3), c MAP<INT,INT>\").parquet(\"/tmp/decimal\").printSchema\r\nroot\r\n |-- a: decimal(3,2) (nullable = true)\r\n |-- b: decimal(18,3) (nullable = true)\r\n |-- c: map (nullable = true)\r\n |    |-- key: integer\r\n |    |-- value: integer (valueContainsNull = true)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. This fixes the correctness issue.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass with the newly added test case.","created_at":"2021-01-25T10:39:19Z","updated_at":"2021-01-27T17:56:42Z","closed_at":"2021-01-26T23:14:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"870acdf30cb2c0e774e4e8c7d12de71889ff7b42","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31319/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31319/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31319/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7932069e5c70fe6ccb99aa7b8a8725a48b402c7e","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-34212","ref":"SPARK-34212","sha":"7932069e5c70fe6ccb99aa7b8a8725a48b402c7e","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"ac8307d75ca7c9e920b1170fb65755bbb85577e4","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nEnsure that if a stage fails in the UI page, the corresponding error message can be displayed correctly.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nerrormessage is not handled properly in JavaScript. If the 'at' is not exist, the error message on the page will be blank.\r\nI made wochanges,\r\n1. `msg.indexOf(\"at\")` => `msg.indexOf(\"\\n\")`\r\n \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52202080/105663531-7362cb00-5f0d-11eb-87fd-008ed65c33ca.png)\r\n\r\n  As shows ablove, truncated at the 'at' position will result in a strange abstract of the error message. If there is a `\\n` worit is more reasonable to truncate at the '\\n' position.\r\n  \r\n2. If the `\\n` does not exist check whether the msg  is more than 100. If true, then truncate the display to avoid too long error message\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManual test shows

change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis is used by release manager only.\r\nManually. This should land at `master/3.1/3.0`.","created_at":"2021-01-24T22:23:15Z","updated_at":"2021-01-25T01:21:09Z","closed_at":"2021-01-24T23:00:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"39eef608970bd4faa6ee747a5937a220918703f3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1982110661,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMTEwNjYx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/INFRA","name":"INFRA","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31310/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31310/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31310/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e133d800ef65b5388dc163b4c0080bf5aac0e49e","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-34217","ref":"SPARK-34217","sha":"e133d800ef65b5388dc163b4c0080bf5aac0e49e","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"652bdf0d5a28037dfcc9d078aaa48b0ea08b9872","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nInvoke `CatalogImpl.refreshTable()` instead of combination of `SessionCatalog.refreshTable()` + `uncacheQuery()`. This allows to clear cached table data while keeping the table cached.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. To improve user experience with Spark SQL\r\n2. To be consistent to other commands, see https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/31206\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```scala\r\nscala> sql(\"CREATE TABLE tbl (c0 int)\")\r\nres1: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = []\r\nscala> sql(\"INSERT INTO tbl SELECT 0\")\r\nres2: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = []\r\nscala> sql(\"CACHE TABLE tbl\")\r\nres3: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = []\r\nscala> sql(\"SELECT * FROM tbl\").show(false)\r\n+---+\r\n|c0 |\r\n+---+\r\n|0  |\r\n+---+\r\nscala> spark.catalog.isCached(\"tbl\")\r\nres5: Boolean = true\r\nscala> sql(\"TRUNCATE TABLE tbl\")\r\nres6: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = []\r\nscala> spark.catalog.isCached(\"tbl\")\r\nres7: Boolean = false\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n```scala\r\nscala> sql(\"TRUNCATE TABLE tbl\")\r\nres6: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = []\r\nscala> spark.catalog.isCached(\"tbl\")\r\nres7: Boolean = true\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new test to `CachedTableSuite`:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly *CachedTableSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly

PR is the same as #31269 to merge to branch 3.0\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR is the same as https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/30998, but with a better UT.\r\nIn AdaptiveSparkPlanExec.getFinalPhysicalPlan, when newStages are generated, sort the new stages by class type to make sure BroadcastQueryState precede others.\r\nThis partial fix only grantee the start of materialization for BroadcastQueryStage is prior to others, but because the submission of collect job for broadcasting is run in another thread, the issue is not completely solved.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhen enable AQE, in getFinalPhysicalPlan, spark traversal the physical plan bottom up and create query stage for materialized part by createQueryStages and materialize those new created query stages to submit map stages or broadcasting. When ShuffleQueryStage are materializing before BroadcastQueryStage, the map stage(job) and broadcast job are submitted almost at the same time, but map stage will hold all the computing resources. If the map stage runs slow (when lots of data needs to process and the resource is limited), the broadcast job cannot be started(and finished) before spark.sql.broadcastTimeout, thus cause whole job failed (introduced in SPARK-31475).\r\nThe workaround to increase spark.sql.broadcastTimeout doesn't make sense and graceful, because the data to broadcast is very small.\r\n\r\nThe order of calling materialize can guarantee that the order of task to be scheduled in normal circumstances, but, the guarantee is not strict since the submit of broadcast job and shuffle map job are in different thread.\r\n1. for broadcast job, call doPrepare() in main thread, and then start the real materialization in \"broadcast-exchange-0\" thread pool: calling getByteArrayRdd().collect() to submit collect job\r\n2. for shuffle map job, call ShuffleExchangeExec.mapOutputStatisticsFuture() which call sparkContext.submitMapStage() directly in main thread to submit map stage\r\n\r\n1 is trigger before 2, so in normal cases, the broadcast job will be submit first.\r\nHowever, we can not control how fast the two thread runs, so the \"broadcast-exchange-0\" thread could run a little bit slower than main thread, result in map stage submit first. So there's still risk for the shuffle map job schedule earlier before broadcast job.\r\n\r\nSince completely fix the issue is complex and might introduce major changes, we need more time to follow up. This partial fix is better than do nothing, it resolved most cases in SPARK-33933.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNO\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR implements [SPARK-34214](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-34214), by exposing the already existing `regexp_extract_all` SQL function in the PySpark API.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nPlease refer to [SPARK-24884](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-24884) for why this function is useful. This PR merely exposes it to the PySpark API, for added consistency and greater availability for users.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, a new function is made available in the PySpark API. The associated docstring is included. Also I tweaked the description of the original `regexp_extract` function to highlight how its behaviour differs from that of `regexp_extract_all`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nI tested it locally in a pyspark console session. I didn't find any tests for `regexp_extract`, so I didn't add any for the new function, but happy to do so if desired.","created_at":"2021-01-24T12:35:52Z","updated_at":"2021-03-01T14:54:33Z","closed_at":"2021-03-01T14:54:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"470f6a8dc3b99715c467f16d312d2a7c98faffaf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31306/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31306/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31306/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e860264a76953ab06bd35376f7ba4d2bda5fcbd3","head":{"label":"asmello:master","ref":"master","sha":"e860264a76953ab06bd35376f7ba4d2bda5fcbd3","user":{"login":"asmello","id":3285133,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyODUxMzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3285133?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmello","html_url":"https://github.com/asmello","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmello/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmello/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmello/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmello/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmello/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmello/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmello/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmello/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmello/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":172223826,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIyMjM4MjY=","name":"spark","full_name":"asmello/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"asmello","id":3285133,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyODUxMzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3285133?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmello","html_url":"https://github.com/asmello","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmello/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmello/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmello/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmello/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmello/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmello/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmello/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmello/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmello/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/asmello/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nInvoke `CatalogImpl.refreshTable()` instead of `SessionCatalog.refreshTable` in v1 implementation of the `LOAD DATA` command. `SessionCatalog.refreshTable` just refreshes metadata comparing to `CatalogImpl.refreshTable()` which refreshes cached table data as well.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe example below portraits the issue:\r\n\r\n- Create a source table:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> CREATE TABLE src_tbl (c0 int, part int) USING hive PARTITIONED BY (part);\r\nspark-sql> INSERT INTO src_tbl PARTITION (part=0) SELECT 0;\r\nspark-sql> SHOW TABLE EXTENDED LIKE 'src_tbl' PARTITION (part=0);\r\ndefault\tsrc_tbl\tfalse\tPartition Values: [part=0]\r\nLocation: file:/Users/maximgekk/proj/load-data-refresh-cache/spark-warehouse/src_tbl/part=0\r\n...\r\n```\r\n- Load data from the source table to a cached destination table:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> CREATE TABLE dst_tbl (c0 int, part int) USING hive PARTITIONED BY (part);\r\nspark-sql> INSERT INTO dst_tbl PARTITION (part=1) SELECT 1;\r\nspark-sql> CACHE TABLE dst_tbl;\r\nspark-sql> SELECT * FROM dst_tbl;\r\n1\t1\r\nspark-sql> LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH '/Users/maximgekk/proj/load-data-refresh-cache/spark-warehouse/src_tbl/part=0' INTO TABLE dst_tbl PARTITION (part=0);\r\nspark-sql> SELECT * FROM dst_tbl;\r\n1\t1\r\n```\r\nThe last query does not return new loaded data. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. After the changes, the example above works correctly:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH '/Users/maximgekk/proj/load-data-refresh-cache/spark-warehouse/src_tbl/part=0' INTO TABLE dst_tbl PARTITION (part=0);\r\nspark-sql> SELECT * FROM dst_tbl;\r\n0\t0\r\n1\t1\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new test to `org.apache.spark.sql.hive.CachedTableSuite`:\r\n```\r\n$

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nInvoke `CatalogImpl.refreshTable()` instead of `SessionCatalog.refreshTable` in v1 implementation of the `LOAD DATA` command. `SessionCatalog.refreshTable` just refreshes metadata comparing to `CatalogImpl.refreshTable()` which refreshes cached table data as well.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe example below portraits the issue:\r\n\r\n- Create a source table:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> CREATE TABLE src_tbl (c0 int, part int) USING hive PARTITIONED BY (part);\r\nspark-sql> INSERT INTO src_tbl PARTITION (part=0) SELECT 0;\r\nspark-sql> SHOW TABLE EXTENDED LIKE 'src_tbl' PARTITION (part=0);\r\ndefault\tsrc_tbl\tfalse\tPartition Values: [part=0]\r\nLocation: file:/Users/maximgekk/proj/load-data-refresh-cache/spark-warehouse/src_tbl/part=0\r\n...\r\n```\r\n- Load data from the source table to a cached destination table:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> CREATE TABLE dst_tbl (c0 int, part int) USING hive PARTITIONED BY (part);\r\nspark-sql> INSERT INTO dst_tbl PARTITION (part=1) SELECT 1;\r\nspark-sql> CACHE TABLE dst_tbl;\r\nspark-sql> SELECT * FROM dst_tbl;\r\n1\t1\r\nspark-sql> LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH '/Users/maximgekk/proj/load-data-refresh-cache/spark-warehouse/src_tbl/part=0' INTO TABLE dst_tbl PARTITION (part=0);\r\nspark-sql> SELECT * FROM dst_tbl;\r\n1\t1\r\n```\r\nThe last query does not return new loaded data. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. After the changes, the example above works correctly:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH '/Users/maximgekk/proj/load-data-refresh-cache/spark-warehouse/src_tbl/part=0' INTO TABLE dst_tbl PARTITION (part=0);\r\nspark-sql> SELECT * FROM dst_tbl;\r\n0\t0\r\n1\t1\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new test to `org.apache.spark.sql.hive.CachedTableSuite`:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis passes original SQL text to `CacheTableCommand` command in DSv1 so that it will be stored instead of the analyzed logical plan, similar to `CREATE VIEW` command.\r\n\r\nIn addition, this changes the behavior of dropping temporary view to also invalidate dependent caches in a cascade, when the config `SQLConf.STORE_ANALYZED_PLAN_FOR_VIEW` is false (which is the default value).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently, after creating a temporary view with `CACHE TABLE ... AS SELECT` command, the view can still be queried even after the source table is dropped or replaced (in v2). This can cause correctness issue.\r\n\r\nFor instance, in the following:\r\n```sql\r\n> CREATE TABLE t ...;\r\n> CACHE TABLE v AS SELECT * FROM t;\r\n> DROP TABLE t;\r\n> SELECT * FROM v;\r\n```\r\nThe last select query still returns the old (and stale) result instead of fail. Note that the cache is already invalidated as part of dropping table `t`, but the temporary view `v` still exist.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the following:\r\n```sql\r\n> CREATE TABLE t ...;\r\n> CREATE TEMPORARY VIEW v AS SELECT * FROM t;\r\n> CACHE TABLE v;\r\n> DROP TABLE t;\r\n> SELECT * FROM v;\r\n```\r\nwill throw \"Table or view not found\" error in the last select query.\r\n\r\nThis is related to #30567 which aligns the behavior of temporary view and global view by storing the original SQL text for temporary view, as opposed to the analyzed logical plan. However, the PR only handles `CreateView` case but not the `CacheTableAsSelect` case.\r\n\r\nThis also changes uncache logic and use cascade invalidation for temporary views created above. This is to align its behavior to how a permanent view is handled as of today, and also to avoid potential issues where a dependent view becomes invalid while its data is still kept in cache.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, now when `SQLConf.STORE_ANALYZED_PLAN_FOR_VIEW` is set to false (the default value), whenever a table/permanent view/temp view that a cached view depends on is dropped, the cached view itself will become invalid during analysis, i.e., user will get \"Table or view not found\" error. In addition, when the dependent is a temp view in the previous case, the cache itself will also be invalidated.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`KubernetesClusterManager` and `ExecutorPodsLifecycleManager` are private Spark classes.\r\nThis PR aims to move `Guava Cache` from a constructor parameter to private field of `ExecutorPodsLifecycleManager`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n1. Although `KubernetesClusterManager` creates `Guava Cache`, only `ExecutorPodsLifecycleManager` uses it.\r\n2. Although `ExecutorPodsLifecycleManager` is a Spark private class, when some users implement a new cluster manager with `ExternalClusterManager` for K8s, they can reuse `ExecutorPodsLifecycleManager`. In this case, `Guava Cache` is not good as an interface because it's a shaded class.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo. This is an Spark private.\r\n\r\n### How was

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to add `pipe` API to `Dataset` to enable pipe feature for streaming Dataset.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n`Dataset` doesn't have `pipe` API but `RDD` has it. Although for normal `Dataset`, user can convert a `Dataset` to `RDD` and call `RDD.pipe` and then convert it back to a `Dataset`, for streaming Dataset it is not possible since queries with streaming sources must be executed with `writeStream.start()`.\r\n\r\nSo that being said, this is actually a requirement from Structured Streaming, but we need to add `pipe` API to `Dataset` to enable it in Structured Streaming. From `Dataset` perspective, it is also easier to use `Dataset` API instead of converting between `Dataset` and `RDD`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, a new API `pipe` is added to `Dataset`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n`HiveExternalCatalogVersionsSuite` can't run in orgs internal environment where access to outside internet is not allowed because `HiveExternalCatalogVersionsSuite` will download spark release package from internet.\r\n\r\nSimilar to SPARK-32998, this pr add 1 environment variables `SPARK_RELEASE_MIRROR` to let user can specify an accessible download address of spark release package and run `HiveExternalCatalogVersionsSuite`  in orgs internal environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nLet `HiveExternalCatalogVersionsSuite` can run in orgs internal environment without relying on external spark release download address.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- Pass the Jenkins or GitHub Action\r\n\r\n- Manual test  with and without env variables set in internal environment can't access

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR fixes the test code build error for `docker-integration-tests` in `branch-3.0`.\r\nCurrently, building test code for docker-integration-tests in `branch-3.0` seems to fail due to `ojdbc6:11.2.0.1.0` and `jdb2jcc4:10.5.0.5` are not available.\r\n\r\nThe solution backports SPARK-32049 and partially SPARK-31272.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo fix the build error.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nThis change affects `OracleIntegrationSuite`  so I confirmed it passed.\r\nThis change also affects `DB2IntegrationSuite` but it's ignored for now so I didn't care for it.","created_at":"2021-01-22T09:06:05Z","updated_at":"2021-02-16T08:03:49Z","closed_at":"2021-02-15T21:09:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4023be0c0e8e8c0c3cf61175ddfb61bcac6ec563","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31291/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31291/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31291/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/58c8d6fcb55b5490970ec16c3d6523088cb5106f","head":{"label":"sarutak:fix-test-build-error","ref":"fix-test-build-error","sha":"58c8d6fcb55b5490970ec16c3d6523088cb5106f","user":{"login":"sarutak","id":4736016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak","html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19300892,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTMwMDg5Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"sarutak/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sarutak","id":4736016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak","html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR backports SPARK-33813 (#31283).\r\nThis PR fixes the issue that reading tables which contain spatial datatypes from MS SQL Server fails.\r\nMS SQL server supports two non-standard spatial JDBC types, `geometry` and  `geography` but Spark SQL can't treat them \r\n\r\n```\r\njava.sql.SQLException: Unrecognized SQL type -157\r\n at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.jdbc.JdbcUtils$.getCatalystType(JdbcUtils.scala:251)\r\n at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.jdbc.JdbcUtils$.$anonfun$getSchema$1(JdbcUtils.scala:321)\r\n at scala.Option.getOrElse(Option.scala:189)\r\n at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.jdbc.JdbcUtils$.getSchema(JdbcUtils.scala:321)\r\n at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.jdbc.JDBCRDD$.resolveTable(JDBCRDD.scala:63)\r\n at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.jdbc.JDBCRelation$.getSchema(JDBCRelation.scala:226)\r\n at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.jdbc.JdbcRelationProvider.createRelation(JdbcRelationProvider.scala:35)\r\n at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.DataSource.resolveRelation(DataSource.scala:364)\r\n at org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrameReader.loadV1Source(DataFrameReader.scala:366)\r\n at org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrameReader.$anonfun$load$2(DataFrameReader.scala:355)\r\n at scala.Option.getOrElse(Option.scala:189)\r\n at org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrameReader.load(DataFrameReader.scala:355)\r\n at org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrameReader.load(DataFrameReader.scala:240)\r\n at org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrameReader.jdbc(DataFrameReader.scala:381)\r\n```\r\n\r\nConsidering the [data type mapping](https://docs.microsoft.com/ja-jp/sql/connect/jdbc/using-basic-data-types?view=sql-server-ver15) says, I think those spatial types can be mapped to Catalyst's `BinaryType`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo provide better support.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. MS SQL Server users can use `geometry` and `geography` types in datasource tables.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR fixes the issue that reading tables which contain spatial datatypes from MS SQL Server fails.\r\nMS SQL server supports two non-standard spatial JDBC types, `geometry` and  `geography` but Spark SQL can't treat them \r\n\r\n```\r\njava.sql.SQLException: Unrecognized SQL type -157\r\n at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.jdbc.JdbcUtils$.getCatalystType(JdbcUtils.scala:251)\r\n at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.jdbc.JdbcUtils$.$anonfun$getSchema$1(JdbcUtils.scala:321)\r\n at scala.Option.getOrElse(Option.scala:189)\r\n at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.jdbc.JdbcUtils$.getSchema(JdbcUtils.scala:321)\r\n at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.jdbc.JDBCRDD$.resolveTable(JDBCRDD.scala:63)\r\n at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.jdbc.JDBCRelation$.getSchema(JDBCRelation.scala:226)\r\n at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.jdbc.JdbcRelationProvider.createRelation(JdbcRelationProvider.scala:35)\r\n at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.DataSource.resolveRelation(DataSource.scala:364)\r\n at org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrameReader.loadV1Source(DataFrameReader.scala:366)\r\n at org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrameReader.$anonfun$load$2(DataFrameReader.scala:355)\r\n at scala.Option.getOrElse(Option.scala:189)\r\n at org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrameReader.load(DataFrameReader.scala:355)\r\n at org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrameReader.load(DataFrameReader.scala:240)\r\n at org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrameReader.jdbc(DataFrameReader.scala:381)\r\n```\r\n\r\nConsidering the [data type mapping](https://docs.microsoft.com/ja-jp/sql/connect/jdbc/using-basic-data-types?view=sql-server-ver15) says, I think those spatial types can be mapped to Catalyst's `BinaryType`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo provide better support.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. MS SQL Server users can use `geometry` and `geography` types in datasource tables.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR backports SPARK-33813 (#31283).\r\nThis PR fixes the issue that reading tables which contain spatial datatypes from MS SQL Server fails.\r\nMS SQL server supports two non-standard spatial JDBC types, `geometry` and  `geography` but Spark SQL can't treat them \r\n\r\n```\r\njava.sql.SQLException: Unrecognized SQL type -157\r\n at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.jdbc.JdbcUtils$.getCatalystType(JdbcUtils.scala:251)\r\n at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.jdbc.JdbcUtils$.$anonfun$getSchema$1(JdbcUtils.scala:321)\r\n at scala.Option.getOrElse(Option.scala:189)\r\n at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.jdbc.JdbcUtils$.getSchema(JdbcUtils.scala:321)\r\n at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.jdbc.JDBCRDD$.resolveTable(JDBCRDD.scala:63)\r\n at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.jdbc.JDBCRelation$.getSchema(JDBCRelation.scala:226)\r\n at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.jdbc.JdbcRelationProvider.createRelation(JdbcRelationProvider.scala:35)\r\n at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.DataSource.resolveRelation(DataSource.scala:364)\r\n at org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrameReader.loadV1Source(DataFrameReader.scala:366)\r\n at org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrameReader.$anonfun$load$2(DataFrameReader.scala:355)\r\n at scala.Option.getOrElse(Option.scala:189)\r\n at org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrameReader.load(DataFrameReader.scala:355)\r\n at org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrameReader.load(DataFrameReader.scala:240)\r\n at org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrameReader.jdbc(DataFrameReader.scala:381)\r\n```\r\n\r\nConsidering the [data type mapping](https://docs.microsoft.com/ja-jp/sql/connect/jdbc/using-basic-data-types?view=sql-server-ver15) says, I think those spatial types can be mapped to Catalyst's `BinaryType`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo provide better support.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. MS SQL Server users can use `geometry` and `geography` types in datasource tables.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nNew test case added to

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a long-standing bug that exists since we have the ambiguous self-join check. A column reference is not ambiguous if it can only come from one join side (e.g. the other side has a project to only pick a few columns). An example is\r\n```\r\nJoin(b#1 = 3)\r\n  TableScan(t, [a#0, b#1])\r\n  Project(a#2)\r\n    TableScan(t, [a#2, b#3])\r\n```\r\nIt's a self-join, but `b#1` is not ambiguous because it can't come from the right side, which only has column `a`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nto not fail valid self-join queries.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nyea as a bug fix\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\na new

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn spark, the `count(table.*)` may cause very weird result, for example:\r\n```\r\nselect count(*) from (select 1 as a, null as b) t;\r\noutput: 1\r\nselect count(t.*) from (select 1 as a, null as b) t;\r\noutput: 0\r\n```\r\n This is because spark expands `t.*` while converts `*` to count(1), this will confuse\r\nusers. After checking the ANSI standard, `count(*)` should always be `count(1)` while `count(t.*)`\r\nis not allowed. What's more, this is also not allowed by common databases, e.g. MySQL, Oracle.\r\n\r\nSo, this PR proposes to block the ambiguous behavior and print a clear error message for users.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nto avoid ambiguous behavior and follow ANSI standard and other SQL engines\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, `count(table.*)` behavior will be blocked and output an error message.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nnewly added and existing tests","created_at":"2021-01-22T04:58:00Z","updated_at":"2021-02-02T07:54:09Z","closed_at":"2021-02-02T07:50:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7e28388433ea3ddffa7e1ef01549d901eb4d41bb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31286/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31286/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31286/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/19340d4fadffc4efe9d4adc823b381c2ec76d590","head":{"label":"linhongliu-db:fix-table-star","ref":"fix-table-star","sha":"19340d4fadffc4efe9d4adc823b381c2ec76d590","user":{"login":"linhongliu-db","id":67896261,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3ODk2MjYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/67896261?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhongliu-db","html_url":"https://github.com/linhongliu-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhongliu-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhongliu-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhongliu-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhongliu-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhongliu-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhongliu-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhongliu-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhongliu-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhongliu-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":289223205,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODkyMjMyMDU=","name":"spark","full_name":"linhongliu-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"linhongliu-db","id":67896261,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3ODk2MjYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/67896261?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhongliu-db","html_url":"https://github.com/linhongliu-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhongliu-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhongliu-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhongliu-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhongliu-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhongliu-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhongliu-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhongliu-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhongliu-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhongliu-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/linhongliu-db/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIf an IntDecimal type was written as a LongDecimal in a parquet file. Spark should read it as a long from `VectorizedValuesReader` but write it to the `WritableColumnVector` as an int by down-casting it and calling the appropriate method. `readLongs` has been modified to take in a boolean flag that tells it if the number would fit in a 32-bit Decimal and subsequently downsized. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIf a Parquet file writes an IntDecimal as LongDecimal, which is supported by the parquet spec, Spark will not be able to read it and will throw an exception.  The reason this happens is because method `readLong` tries to write the long to a `WritableColumnVector` which has been initialized to accept only Ints which leads to a `NullPointerException`. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nmanually tested and added unit-test

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nOn the read-side, the char length check and padding bring issues to CBO and predicate pushdown and other issues to the catalyst.\r\n\r\nThis PR reverts 6da5cdf1dbfc35cee0ce32aa9e44c0b4187373d9  that added read side length check) so that we only do length check for the write side, and data sources/vendors are responsible to enforce the char/varchar constraints for data import operations like ADD PARTITION. It doesn't make sense for Spark to report errors on the read-side if the data is already dirty.\r\n\r\nThis PR also moves the char padding to the write-side, so that it 1) avoids read side issues like CBO and filter pushdown. 2) the data source can preserve char type semantic better even if it's read by systems other than Spark.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nfix perf regression when tables have char/varchar type columns\r\n\r\ncloses #31278\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nyes, spark will not raise error for oversized char/varchar values in read side\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nmodified ut\r\n\r\nthe dropped read side

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR supplements the contents in the \"Python Package Management\".\r\n\r\nIf there is no Python installed in the local for all nodes when using `venv-pack`, job would fail as below.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> from pyspark.sql.functions import pandas_udf\r\n>>> @pandas_udf('double')\r\n... def pandas_plus_one(v: pd.Series) -> pd.Series:\r\n...     return v + 1\r\n...\r\n>>> spark.range(10).select(pandas_plus_one(\"id\")).show()\r\n...\r\nCannot run program \"./environment/bin/python\": error=2, No such file or directory\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is because the Python in the [packed environment via `venv-pack` has a symbolic link](https://github.com/jcrist/venv-pack/issues/5) that connects Python to the local one.\r\n\r\nTo avoid this confusion, it seems better to have an additional explanation for this.\r\n \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo provide more detailed information to users so that they don’t get confused\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, this PR fixes the part of \"Python Package Management\"  in the \"User Guide\" documents.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually built the doc.\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2021-01-21 at 7 10 38

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch uses the available offset range obtained during polling Kafka records to do offset validation check.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWe support non-consecutive offsets for Kafka since 2.4.0. In `fetchRecord`, we do offset validation by checking if the offset is in available offset range. But currently we obtain latest available offset range to do the check. It looks not correct as the available offset range could be changed during the batch, so the available offset range is different than the one when we polling the records from Kafka.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that an offset is valid when polling, but at the time we do the above check, it is out of latest available offset range. We will wrongly consider it as data loss case and fail the query or drop the record.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis should pass existing unit tests.\r\n\r\nThis is hard to have unit test as the Kafka producer and the consumer is asynchronous. Further, we also need to make the offset out of new available offset range.","created_at":"2021-01-21T07:40:42Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:24:44Z","closed_at":"2021-01-24T19:51:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"787e75eb0cabbdd6b65f5a317b07e589eaab4781","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR proposes to make `CreateViewStatement.child` to be `LogicalPlan`'s `children` so that it's resolved in the analyze phase.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently, the `CreateViewStatement.child` is resolved when the create view command runs, which is inconsistent with other plan resolutions. For example, you may see the following in the physical plan:\r\n```\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\nExecute CreateViewCommand (1)\r\n   +- CreateViewCommand (2)\r\n         +- Project (4)\r\n            +- UnresolvedRelation (3)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. For the example, you will now see the resolved plan:\r\n```\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\nExecute CreateViewCommand (1)\r\n   +- CreateViewCommand (2)\r\n         +- Project (5)\r\n            +- SubqueryAlias (4)\r\n               +- LogicalRelation (3)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR reverts SPARK-33888 (#30902) .\r\nThat PR has the two serious problems.\r\n\r\n1. A regression which affects PostgresDialect causing `PostgreSQLIntegrationSuite` to fail.\r\n2. That PR changes the JDBC-Catalyst type mapping. `sql.Types.TIME` is mapped to `sql.types.IntegerType` so we'll get millisecond value. But the start time point is different between `MsSqlServer` and other RDBMSs. For `MsSqlServer`, it starts from `1900-01-01 00:00:00` while `1970-01-01 00:00:00` for other RDBMS.\r\n\r\nMore about problem-2, the following assertion passes before SPARK-33888.\r\n```\r\n// This is from jdbc.MsSqlServerIntegrationSuite\r\nassert(row.getAs[Timestamp](5).equals(Timestamp.valueOf(\"1900-01-01 13:31:24.0\")))\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut after SPARK-33888, the following modified assertion fails because the millisecond value is considered starting from `1970-01-01 00:00:00`.\r\n```\r\nassert(row.getAs[Integer](5).equals(Timestamp.valueOf(\"1900-01-01 13:31:24.0\").getTime.toInt))\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo fix the serious issues.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nThis is just reverting a previous

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR is the same as https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/30998, but with a better UT.\r\nIn AdaptiveSparkPlanExec.getFinalPhysicalPlan, when newStages are generated, sort the new stages by class type to make sure BroadcastQueryState precede others.\r\nThis partial fix only grantee the start of materialization for BroadcastQueryStage is prior to others, but because the submission of collect job for broadcasting is run in another thread, the issue is not completely solved.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhen enable AQE, in getFinalPhysicalPlan, spark traversal the physical plan bottom up and create query stage for materialized part by createQueryStages and materialize those new created query stages to submit map stages or broadcasting. When ShuffleQueryStage are materializing before BroadcastQueryStage, the map stage(job) and broadcast job are submitted almost at the same time, but map stage will hold all the computing resources. If the map stage runs slow (when lots of data needs to process and the resource is limited), the broadcast job cannot be started(and finished) before spark.sql.broadcastTimeout, thus cause whole job failed (introduced in SPARK-31475).\r\nThe workaround to increase spark.sql.broadcastTimeout doesn't make sense and graceful, because the data to broadcast is very small.\r\n\r\nThe order of calling materialize can guarantee that the order of task to be scheduled in normal circumstances, but, the guarantee is not strict since the submit of broadcast job and shuffle map job are in different thread.\r\n1. for broadcast job, call doPrepare() in main thread, and then start the real materialization in \"broadcast-exchange-0\" thread pool: calling getByteArrayRdd().collect() to submit collect job\r\n2. for shuffle map job, call ShuffleExchangeExec.mapOutputStatisticsFuture() which call sparkContext.submitMapStage() directly in main thread to submit map stage\r\n\r\n1 is trigger before 2, so in normal cases, the broadcast job will be submit first.\r\nHowever, we can not control how fast the two thread runs, so the \"broadcast-exchange-0\" thread could run a little bit slower than main thread, result in map stage submit first. So there's still risk for the shuffle map job schedule earlier before broadcast job.\r\n\r\nSince completely fix the issue is complex and might introduce major changes, we need more time to follow up.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR makes sure that `SharedState` would be only initiated once across SparkSessions.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis helps us to fix the listener(e.g., SQLAppStatusListener) leak issue, and allow SparkSessions created by `getOrCreate` to share the `CacheManager`,  global temp view, etc.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded UTs.\r\n\r\nClose

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nMetricSystem picks up new metrics from sources that are added throughout execution. If you do measurements via dynamic proxies you might not want to redeclare all metrics that the proxies will create and you'd prefer them to get populated as they're being produced. Right now all sources are processed only onceat startup and metrics are picked up only if they have been registered statically at compile time. Behaviour I am proposing lets you not have to declare metrics in two places.\r\n\r\nThis had been previously suggested in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/18406 and https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29980. I have reduced the scope of the change to just dynamic metric registration.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently there's no way to access MetricRegistry that MetricsSystem uses to hold its state and as such it's not possible to reprocess a source. MetricsSystem throws if any metric had already been registered previously.\r\n\r\nn.b. the MetricRegistry is added as a constructor argument to make testing easier but could as well be accessed via reflection as a private variable.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCheck the name passed to `SessionCatalog.refreshTable`, and if it belongs to a temporary view, do not invalidate the relation cache.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhen `SessionCatalog.refreshTable` refreshes a temporary or global temporary view, it should not invalidate an entry in the relation cache associated to a table with the same name.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nShould not. The change might improve performance slightly.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running new UT:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive-2.3 -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nWhen writing rows to a table only the old date time API types are handled in org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.jdbc.JdbcUtils#makeSetter. If the new API is used (spark.sql.datetime.java8API.enabled=true) casting Instant and LocalDate to Timestamp and Date respectively fails. The proposed change is to handle Instant and LocalDate values and transform them to Timestamp and Date.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIn the current state writing Instant or LocalDate values to a table fails with something like:\r\nCaused by: java.lang.ClassCastException: class java.time.LocalDate cannot be cast to class java.sql.Date (java.time.LocalDate is in module java.base of loader 'bootstrap'; java.sql.Date is in module java.sql of loader 'platform') at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.jdbc.JdbcUtils$.$anonfun$makeSetter$11(JdbcUtils.scala:573) at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.jdbc.JdbcUtils$.$anonfun$makeSetter$11$adapted(JdbcUtils.scala:572) at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.jdbc.JdbcUtils$.savePartition(JdbcUtils.scala:678) at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.jdbc.JdbcUtils$.$anonfun$saveTable$1(JdbcUtils.scala:858) at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.jdbc.JdbcUtils$.$anonfun$saveTable$1$adapted(JdbcUtils.scala:856) at org.apache.spark.rdd.RDD.$anonfun$foreachPartition$2(RDD.scala:994) at org.apache.spark.rdd.RDD.$anonfun$foreachPartition$2$adapted(RDD.scala:994) at org.apache.spark.SparkContext.$anonfun$runJob$5(SparkContext.scala:2139) at org.apache.spark.scheduler.ResultTask.runTask(ResultTask.scala:90) at org.apache.spark.scheduler.Task.run(Task.scala:127) at org.apache.spark.executor.Executor$TaskRunner.$anonfun$run$3(Executor.scala:446) at org.apache.spark.util.Utils$.tryWithSafeFinally(Utils.scala:1377) at org.apache.spark.executor.Executor$TaskRunner.run(Executor.scala:449) ... 3 more\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR backports SPARK-34005 (#31029).\r\nThis PR makes `AppStatusListener` update the peak memory metrics for each Executor on task end like other peak memory metrics (e.g, stage, executors in a stage).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nWhen `AppStatusListener#onExecutorMetricsUpdate` is called, peak memory metrics for Executors, stages and executors in a stage are updated but currently, the metrics only for Executors are not updated on task end.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. Executor peak memory metrics is updated more accurately.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAfter I run a job with `local-cluster[1,1,1024]` and visited `/api/v1/<appid>/executors`, I confirmed `peakExecutorMemory` metrics is shown for an Executor even though the life time of each job is very short .\r\nI also modify the json files for `HistoryServerSuite`.","created_at":"2021-01-20T09:40:06Z","updated_at":"2021-06-04T20:41:34Z","closed_at":"2021-01-20T11:51:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"80e7370e1dd454fdf21da4106cdc6d3bd4bdcc25","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31261/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31261/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31261/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4d721f2ded0e202938e7fe5b545a56beeda8ff1d","head":{"label":"sarutak:SPARK-34005-branch-3.1","ref":"SPARK-34005-branch-3.1","sha":"4d721f2ded0e202938e7fe5b545a56beeda8ff1d","user":{"login":"sarutak","id":4736016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak","html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19300892,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTMwMDg5Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"sarutak/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sarutak","id":4736016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak","html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCall `copyTagsFrom` for the new node created by `MultiInstanceRelation.newInstance()`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nval df = spark.range(2)\r\ndf.join(df, df(\"id\") <=> df(\"id\")).show()\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor this query, it's supposed to be non-ambiguous join by the rule `DetectAmbiguousSelfJoin` because of the same attribute reference in the condition:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/537a49fc0966b0b289b67ac9c6ea20093165b0da/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/analysis/DetectAmbiguousSelfJoin.scala#L125\r\n\r\nHowever, `DetectAmbiguousSelfJoin` can not apply this prediction due to the right side plan doesn't contain the dataset_id TreeNodeTag, which is missing after `MultiInstanceRelation.newInstance`. That's why we should preserve the tags info for the copied node.\r\n\r\nFortunately, the query is still considered as non-ambiguous join because `DetectAmbiguousSelfJoin` only checks the left side plan and the reference is the same as the left side plan. However, this's not the expected behavior but only a coincidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUpdated a unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd `count_distinct` as an option argument to Dataset#summary (the method already supports count, min, max, etc.)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe `summary()` method is used for lightweight exploratory data analysis.  A distinct count of all the columns is one of the most common exploratory data analysis queries.\r\n\r\nDistinct counts can be expensive, so this shouldn't be enabled by default.  The proposed implementation is completely backwards compatible.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, users can now call `df.summary(\"count_distinct\")`, which wasn't an option before.  Users can still call `df.summary()` without any arguments and the output is the same.  `count_distinct` was not added as one of the `defaultStatistics`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests.\r\n\r\n### Additional comments\r\n\r\nIf this idea is accepted, we should add a PySpark implementation in this PR, as suggested by @zero323.","created_at":"2021-01-20T04:01:51Z","updated_at":"2021-01-28T14:38:32Z","closed_at":"2021-01-28T14:38:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9f7e37faf6f627161a1b5070b677cb2a45e8229d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31254/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31254/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31254/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/bc547a2c949dba8322378a334d8f7221e46e3784","head":{"label":"MrPowers:SPARK-34165","ref":"SPARK-34165","sha":"bc547a2c949dba8322378a334d8f7221e46e3784","user":{"login":"MrPowers","id":2722395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MjIzOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2722395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrPowers","html_url":"https://github.com/MrPowers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrPowers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrPowers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrPowers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrPowers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrPowers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrPowers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrPowers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrPowers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrPowers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":83239902,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MzIzOTkwMg==","name":"spark","full_name":"MrPowers/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MrPowers","id":2722395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MjIzOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2722395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrPowers","html_url":"https://github.com/MrPowers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrPowers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrPowers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrPowers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrPowers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrPowers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrPowers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrPowers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrPowers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrPowers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MrPowers/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAllow users to have Spark attempt to decommission excluded executors. \r\nSince excluded executors may be flaky, this also adds the ability for users to specify a time limit after which a decommissioning executor will be killed by Spark.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis may help prevent fetch failures from excluded executors, and also handle the situation in which executors \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, two new configuration flags for the behaviour.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExtended unit and integration tests.","created_at":"2021-01-19T20:09:49Z","updated_at":"2021-02-09T23:41:30Z","closed_at":"2021-02-09T22:22:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"050bd682a63b366c282cd1e40e8dba4cb5682a99","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605057,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/KUBERNETES","name":"KUBERNETES","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31249/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31249/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31249/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/73bfd55dc3d9b3968658dd874de94c6ce5577252","head":{"label":"holdenk:configure-inaccessibleList-kill-to-use-decommissioning","ref":"configure-inaccessibleList-kill-to-use-decommissioning","sha":"73bfd55dc3d9b3968658dd874de94c6ce5577252","user":{"login":"holdenk","id":59893,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5ODkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59893?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk","html_url":"https://github.com/holdenk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17235154,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzNTE1NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"holdenk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"holdenk","id":59893,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5ODkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59893?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk","html_url":"https://github.com/holdenk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/holdenk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhile adding new partition to v2 `InMemoryAtomicPartitionTable`/`InMemoryPartitionTable`, add single row to the table content when the table is fully partitioned.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe `ALTER TABLE .. ADD PARTITION` command does not change content of fully partitioned v2 table. For instance, `INSERT INTO` changes table content:\r\n```scala\r\n      sql(s\"CREATE TABLE t (p0 INT, p1 STRING) USING _ PARTITIONED BY (p0, p1)\")\r\n      sql(s\"INSERT INTO t SELECT 1, 'def'\")\r\n      sql(s\"SELECT * FROM t\").show(false)\r\n\r\n+---+---+\r\n|p0 |p1 |\r\n+---+---+\r\n|1  |def|\r\n+---+---+\r\n```\r\nbut `ALTER TABLE .. ADD PARTITION` doesn't change v2 table content:\r\n```scala\r\n      sql(s\"ALTER TABLE t ADD PARTITION (p0 = 0, p1 = 'abc')\")\r\n      sql(s\"SELECT * FROM t\").show(false)\r\n\r\n+---+---+\r\n|p0 |p1 |\r\n+---+---+\r\n+---+---+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, the changes impact only on tests but for the example above in tests:\r\n```scala\r\n      sql(s\"ALTER TABLE t ADD PARTITION (p0 = 0, p1 = 'abc')\")\r\n      sql(s\"SELECT * FROM t\").show(false)\r\n\r\n+---+---+\r\n|p0 |p1 |\r\n+---+---+\r\n|0  |abc|\r\n+---+---+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was
