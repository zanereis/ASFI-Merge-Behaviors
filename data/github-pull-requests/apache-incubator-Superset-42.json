change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis PR fixes a bug that allowed a user to add a chart to a dashboard they had access to view, but did not own.  This was possible because the `POST /api/v1/chart` endpoint used to create new charts allows a list of dashboard id's to be passed that the new chart should be added to.  However, the endpoint did not validate whether the user was an owner of these dashboards, only if they could view the dashboard (via the filter on the `DashboardDAO`).\r\n\r\nThis PR patches this endpoint so that it now verifies the user is an owner of each dashboard they are trying to add the new chart to.  It also includes a fix to the explore frontend code so that the save modal dashboard dropdown only pre-populates if the user is an owner of the dashboard they came from.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nBefore (logged in as alpha role but not owner of the dashboard):\r\n\r\n![non_owner_save_as_before](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/47196419/207098b2-40d7-4dfd-b629-e9821df8539c)\r\n\r\nAfter (same user):\r\n\r\n![non_owner_save_as_after](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/47196419/685fad00-e54e-49c7-9d05-31f2f053ccfd)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

remain in the database. I speculate maybe these were accidentally skipped when resolving a diamond dependency.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a migration to drop these tables. Note that the downgrade is a no-op as there's no reference to the underlying schemas in the code pre-migration. I'm made sure the migration is atomic by first checking that the table exists prior to it being dropped. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR fixes incorrect dependencies between filters related feature flags. Specifically:\r\n- Makes `DASHBOARD_CROSS_FILTERS` independent of `DASHBOARD_NATIVE_FILTERS`. Previously, if `DASHBOARD_NATIVE_FILTERS` was disabled and `DASHBOARD_CROSS_FILTERS` was enabled, it would show native filters.\r\n- Makes `DASHBOARD_NATIVE_FILTERS_SET` dependent of `DASHBOARD_NATIVE_FILTERS`. Previously, if `DASHBOARD_NATIVE_FILTERS_SET` was enabled and `DASHBOARD_NATIVE_FILTERS` was disabled, it would lead to an inconsistent state because filter sets can't be applied if there are no native filters.\r\n\r\nCloses https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/24595\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nRecording showing the new relationship between the feature flags:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/assets/70410625/09fd10f8-e527-4358-bd0a-b0aaddfdfce2\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1 - Enable/disable the mentioned feature flags using different combinations\r\n2 - Make sure the elements are rendered according to the new feature flag relationship\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible\r\n  - [ ] Confirm DB migration upgrade and downgrade tested\r\n  - [ ] Runtime estimates and downtime expectations provided\r\n- [ ] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or API\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-06T18:18:48Z","updated_at":"2024-03-08T17:28:47Z","closed_at":"2023-07-07T12:44:34Z","merged_at":"2023-07-07T12:44:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"781a20423a373408f847834100a15e1f9b15a276","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1331560260,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzMxNTYwMjYw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/size/L","name":"size/L","color":"6D53B9","default":false,"description":""},{"id":5111009119,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAlosUs8AAAABMKPPXw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/v3.0","name":"v3.0","color":"0070C9","default":false,"description":"Label

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis a a fast follow to https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/24466 which condensed the delete/bulk-delete DAO operations. Specifically it condenses the delete/bulk-delete commands into a single operation which helps to ensure we adhere to the DRY principle (and removes ~ 500 lines of code).\r\n\r\nThough the change maybe somewhat difficult to grok from a GitHub diff perspective the logic is as follows. If there exists `commands/bulk_delete.py` and optionally `commands/delete.py` file, then:\r\n\r\n1. Delete the `commands/delete.py` file.\r\n2. Rename `commands/bulk_delete.py` to `commands/delete.py`.\r\n3. Rename `BulkDelete...`  to `Delete...` for commands, exceptions, etc.\r\n\r\nNote that delete DAOs currently support either one or a list of models (a feature added in https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/24466) whereas the commands currently only support a list. Ideally this should be more consistent, but I didn't want to go down the yak shaving route as there likely is more cleanup needed when the commands are refactored as the current validation logic (which mutates state) likely needs to be addressed. \r\n\r\nFinally I didn't update the unit tests. The single and bulk deletion tests are still separate.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING

https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/24488 I added logic to enable foreign key support for SQLite. A positive byproduct of said change is there are a slew of SQLite integration tests which were disabled due to the lack of foreign key support (and/or blind copypasta).\r\n\r\nThis PR simply reenables

SUMMARY\r\nSince new Dataset creation layout doesn't use virtualized list component for the table list, hard to operate the dataset creation with large table set (>10k). (mostly browser is frozen while scrolling down)\r\n\r\n<img width=\"953\" alt=\"superset-goalie_-_Airbnb_-_Slack\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/1392866/775b0483-d9e3-4c7b-afaf-91b3ada67097\">\r\n\r\nSince the left panel layout designed for database/schema/table selection, we can reuse the  database/schema/table selector (which uses virtualized list) for the same functionality (except the warning icon. However the warning message will be shown as is once user selects a table. I think it won't be critical without the warning icon on the list)\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n<img width=\"873\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-07-05 at 2 43 20 PM\"

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR adds the option to use a custom codec for serializing/deserializing values in the `SupersetMetastoreCache`. In addition, the default Explore form data and Dashboard filter state cache config is changed to use the JSON key-value codec.  This will not affect deployments that are using Redis or another cache. In addition, we're already emitting a warning when using it in prod, and since it will only cause a problem if a user happens to refresh their browser right after the state has last been updated, there is minimal risk that this will cause issues for users.\r\n\r\nTests are added to ensure that the cache works as expected with both the JSON and Pickle codecs.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nThere might be scenarios where you want to perform custom filtering on the list of databases returned by the DatabaseRestApi, right now, there's no way besides monkey patching that you can do so. This PR adds a new config definition in our app and makes use of it in the `DatabaseFilter` which is applied to all searches so you can add custom filtering if needed via config, adding live filtering capabilities to our searches and easing customization.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Add a filtering function in your config file so all GET or GET list requests can make use of it and return a filtered result\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB

SUMMARY\r\n\r\n- Currently, Google BigQuery python sdk is not compatible with `gevent`, due to some dynamic monkeypatching on python core library by `gevent`.\r\n  - https://github.com/googleapis/python-bigquery/issues/697\r\n  - https://github.com/gevent/gevent/issues/1797\r\n  - https://github.com/grpc/grpc/issues/4629\r\n- Even though enabling `GLOBAL_ASYNC_QUERIES` feature flag, some superset UI&API remain to be called on webserver, instead of celery worker. (ex: `force_refresh` UI on `v2.1.0`)\r\n- So, it helps superset users, to notice `gunicorn` with `gevent` worker type is not compatible with `bigquery` data source.\r\n- Related community links\r\n  -

SUMMARY\r\nFixes a bug where the metric name is truncated when displayed in the tooltip. This creates a problem because the metric name might already be truncated in the control and the user wishes to see its full name. Now the tooltip will only truncate when it surpasses the max number of lines defined by the `Tooltip` component.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<img width=\"301\"

SUMMARY\r\nFix a bug introduced by https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/24488 that happens when running on SQL Lite. There was an event being registered inside another event and causing a `deque mutated during iteration error`. According to SQL Alchemy [docs](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/core/event.html#sqlalchemy.event.listen):\r\n\r\n> The [listen()](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/core/event.html#sqlalchemy.event.listen) function cannot be called at the same time that the target event is being run. This has implications for thread safety, and also means an event cannot be added from inside the listener function for itself. The list of events to be run are present inside of a mutable collection that can’t be changed during iteration.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<img width=\"1785\"

error does not happen when accessing a dashboard on SQL Lite.\r\n- Check that if a dataset is deleted, its associated columns and metrics are also deleted.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ]

SUMMARY\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/pull/21760 added the cross-referenced dashboards feature which is really valuable to our users. As part of the changes, the function to fetch the dashboards was operating differently depending on the existence of a search text. When a search was present, it was invoking `/api/v1/chart` which brings only the dashboards associated to the charts and when no search was present it was invoking `/api/v1/dashboard` which ignores the charts relationship. \r\n\r\nThis was causing some problems:\r\n- There was an error when invoking `/api/v1/chart` related to the constructed query.\r\n- There was a performance implication in scenarios where the number of charts is really high because the application needs to join the charts and dashboards tables to resolve the associations.\r\n- The behavior was different than the Datasets filter which ignores the charts relationships.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the logic to always query the `/api/v1/dashboard` endpoint and ignore the relationships with charts.\r\n\r\n###

SUMMARY\r\nWhen user added a native filter with \"Select first filter value by default\" checked and set a scope to a PR that's initially out of scope, the dashboard won't load if the native filters bar is in horizontal mode.\r\nThis PR fixes it by setting `forceRender` on the dropdown content in horizontal bar if there is a filter with the option selected.\r\n\r\nA similar error has been fixed in PR https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/23299 - however, it turned out that the fix worked only for filter bar in vertical mode.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/assets/15073128/24ac7bdf-561d-47d0-be13-75d8eb89e467\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/assets/15073128/53d3b6b9-e00d-45f8-a05c-bcd4d50e4244\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Create a dashboard and add two tabs to it\r\n2. Add one chart to each tab, and a third chart under the Tabs element.\r\n3. Create two dashboard filters with with \"Select first filter value by default\" option checked: one mapped to Tab 1 and the chart outside tabs and the other only mapped to Tab 2.\r\n4. Save filter changes.\r\n5. Change the filter bar orientation to Horizontal.\r\n6. Navigate back to Dashboards and access it from the list.\r\n\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing

SUMMARY\r\nFollowing up [SIP-93](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/21385), this commit implements the first step of non-blocking persistence mode for the current working sqllab editor activities.\r\n\r\nAs described in [SIP-93](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/21385), the existing PERSISTENCE logic causes a user interaction delay due to the network (or server side) lagging. For example, user had to wait the server response in order to update the tab name or query limit count. (see the before screenshot)\r\n\r\nTherefore, this commit aims to improve current tab activities by replacing the following blocking logics with a non-blocking way by cumulating the changes and syncing them with the latest updates asynchronously: \r\n\r\n```\r\n- querySuccess\r\n- queryFailed\r\n- toggleLeftBar\r\n- queryEditorSetDb\r\n- queryEditorSetSchema\r\n- queryEditorSetAutorun\r\n- queryEditorSetTitle\r\n- queryEditorSetSql\r\n- queryEditorSetQueryLimit\r\n- queryEditorSetTemplateParams\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Mechanism for syncing unsaved changes\r\n\r\n![debounced](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/1392866/a7a45d8f-14fd-40e7-a563-ce4049433c35)\r\n\r\nThere can be unsaved changes since it is syncing in a non-blocking way and asynchronously. To address this issue, unsaved changes will be stored in local storage (using localStorage in persistence mode) until they are successfully saved on the server. This hybrid approach ensures that user data is not lost and that any unsaved changes are retrieved, even in the event of an unexpected interruption.\r\n\r\n#### Resolve conflicts\r\n\r\nWhen a user opens multiple windows, they may be overwritten by the inactive editor tab state. To prevent this unexpected overwrite, the latest update time will be compared with the local cache state, and the out-of-updated state will be discarded. This ensures that users can work on multiple windows without losing their progress or having their work overwritten.\r\n\r\n#### Following up\r\n\r\nCreating new tabs and removing tabs are still blocking way in this commit but will be migrated into the non-blocking way in future PRs. Additionally, the existing migrateQueryEditorFromLocalStorage logic will be consolidated or replaced by the AutoSync with mutation APIs in the upcoming PRs. These changes will further improve the user experience by making the entire process non-blocking and asynchronous.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

Superset with Celery to 5.3.0 (within the defined constraints) we started to notice an issue with Superset trying to parse a date/time string which was already of type `datetime`. \r\n\r\n```\r\n...\r\n  File \"superset/tasks/scheduler.py\", line 81, in execute\r\n    scheduled_dttm_ = parser.parse(scheduled_dttm)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.9/dist-packages/dateutil/parser/_parser.py\", line 1368, in parse\r\n    return DEFAULTPARSER.parse(timestr, **kwargs)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.9/dist-packages/dateutil/parser/_parser.py\", line 640, in parse\r\n    res, skipped_tokens = self._parse(timestr, **kwargs)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.9/dist-packages/dateutil/parser/_parser.py\", line 719, in _parse\r\n    l = _timelex.split(timestr)         # Splits the timestr into tokens\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.9/dist-packages/dateutil/parser/_parser.py\", line 201, in split\r\n    return list(cls(s))\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.9/dist-packages/dateutil/parser/_parser.py\", line 69, in __init__\r\n    raise TypeError('Parser must be a string or character stream, not '\r\nTypeError: Parser must be a string or character stream, not datetime\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've spent a good amount of time perusing the Celery changelog and couldn't find anything which would have caused the regression, given that it seems we're using JSON for serialization/deserialization and there was no mention of the decoder trying to decode temporal arguments.\r\n\r\nI did notice that there was some \"magical\" handling for the request ETA which, per [here](https://github.com/celery/celery/blob/51b28461d0d8b2fdf7db8a7cd2368ba11222bb6d/celery/worker/request.py#L135), tries to coerce the JSON encoded date/time into a `datetime` object. Digging a little future there seems to be some redundancy in how we define our tasks, i.e., providing both an ETA and a schedule which equate to the same thing.\r\n\r\nThis PR circumvents the problem by simply removing specifying the schedule in addition to the ETA which removes redundancy the need to decode the schedule. Note an alternative would be to tighten the constraint on the upper bound of feasible Celery versions, but this approach seemed more accomodating.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

SUMMARY\r\nWARNING: This PR might be considered a breaking change. Currently the d3formats defined in dataset editor for saved metrics worked only in Table and Pivot Table charts. Now they will also work in viz types listed below and they take priority over d3 formats defined in control panel. That means that charts that use metrics that have custom formats defined on dataset level might change their displayed number formats.\r\n\r\nEnables users to set a currency formatter for saved metrics in Datasource edit modal.\r\n\r\nCurrently supported currencies are: `\"USD\", \"EUR\", \"GBP\", \"INR\", \"MXN\", \"JPY\", \"CNY\"` (+ user can manually type other currency codes in the currency picker). More currency codes can be added in `config.py` by modifying array `CURRENCIES`.\r\n\r\nCurrently supported charts are: Table, Pivot Table, Big Number (+ with trendline), (Time)Series Echarts, Pie, Gauge, Funnel, Treemap.\r\n\r\nThe number is formatted using the d3 format specified either for saved metric in datasource editor (takes priority) or in control panel. If user picks a d3 formatter that adds `%` or currency signs, the special signs are ignored.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/assets/15073128/281ec0b5-3506-4dbb-a709-50080fa9906b\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n0. If you're running this PR locally, run the migration first\r\n1. Open 1 of the supported charts\r\n2. Open datasource editor, add/edit a saved metric and set a currency\r\n3. Use the metric with currency in the chart\r\n4. Verify that values are formatted with currency sign\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an

SUMMARY\r\n#24422 introduced a regression which caused SQL Lab results to not show up in SQL Lab for clients that had a negative TZ offset. This was due to the backend returning timestamps in naive format that don't include a prefix to indicate that the timestamp is in UTC TZ. Due to parsing this using `Date.parse()` in the frontend, this timestamp was assumed to be in local timezone, causing an inconsistency when requesting updated queries using the epoch representation.\r\n\r\nThis fixes the issue by using the `normalizeTimestamp` function from `@superset-ui/core`, and adds tests to ensure that `queriesLastUpdate` in Redux state is correctly normalized (a `denormalizeTimestamp` util is added as it's needed for updating the tests). This new test would previously have failed on master branch when run in non-UTC TZ.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

the build of the image, a lot of unnecessary duplicate commands are passed, which are redundant. This PR allows you to correct this oversight and allows you to facilitate the process of further support by developers.\r\nAdded parameter ```DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1``` to add new features to build the image.\r\nAlso in the docker-bootstrap.sh script, the if function has been replaced with a case - it looks much better and is easier to maintain. \"Unknown Operation!!!\" was added to make it clear to users in case of image customization what their mistake is.\r\n\r\n<!---\r\nPlease write the PR title following the conventions at

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe `slim` Python images are based on the latest Debian release.\r\n\r\nDebian 12 Bookworm was released two weeks ago and I've seen some projects break because the APT packages they relied on are not available anymore.\r\n\r\nAs Superset does use `apt-get` during the build, it's better to pin the underlying Debian base image. This probably won't be an issue for a long time though...\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nManually build from the `Dockerfile`,\r\n\r\n```\r\ndocker build --target lean -t superset .\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn stdout, we should see that the image is built from `3.9-slim-bookworm`,\r\n\r\n```\r\nSending build context to Docker daemon    127MB\r\nStep 1/31 : ARG

SUMMARY\r\nThe current implementation of the time-series charts in ECharts seems to have a limitation in properly rendering big numbers. As a result, the display of big numbers in the chart is broken.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n<img width=\"899\" alt=\"68d58a51-b0f2-42b0-b191-f35372d8b5dd\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/97945303/c403ef96-aa18-49be-84db-8457ef55b071\">\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n<img width=\"904\" alt=\"19053635-9d5a-42e4-81a0-cd2d7aa51790\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/97945303/a5bf5b93-507f-4792-9d0f-05e5e5f539f1\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nTo replicate the issue with big number display in time series charts, you can create a time series chart that includes data points with large numeric values. Here is an example SQL query that can be executed in SQL Lab to generate such data:\r\n\r\n```\r\nselect 9223372036854775807 as huge_number, 'abc' as str union all\r\nselect 9223372036854775807.5 as huge_number, 'foo' as str union all\r\nselect 92233720368547758071111 as huge_number, 'bar' as str\r\n```\r\n\r\n1. After executing the SQL query in SQL Lab and getting the result set, click on the \"Create Chart\" button.\r\n2. In the chart creation page, switch to the \"LINE CHART\" option.\r\n3. On the chart configuration panel, select the 'str' column for the x-axis.\r\n4. Add the \"SUM(huge_number)\" column to the y-axis to represent the aggregated big numbers.\r\n5.

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nPer  [SIP-92 Proposal for restructuring the Python code base](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/20630) https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/24331 organized all the DAOs to be housed within a shared folder—the result of which highlighted numerous inconsistencies, repetition, and inefficiencies.\r\n\r\nPersonally I really struggle at times with the SQLAlchemy model especially with regards to the relationship logic and why the cascade paradigm only impacts the SQLAlchemy ORM, i.e., isn't materialized to the actual table schema. The TL;DR is there always seems to be multiple ways to skin the cat which just adds to the confusion.\r\n\r\nSomething clearly is quite right with our model as it's often the case when deleting a dataset we first delete the owners, columns, and metrics to avoid foreign key constrain violations. I gather this is because of our bulk delete logic (see [this](https://apache-superset.slack.com/archives/G013HAE6Y0K/p1687396791699689) discussion for more detail) bypasses the SQLAlchemy ORM or there are other gremlins at play—there is [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72223166/sqlalchemy-delete-rows-from-associate-table-from-many-to-many-relationship) issue reported on Stack Overflow regarding cascading for association tables.\r\n\r\nI recently added the [DAO-Style-Guidelines-and-Best-Practices](https://github.com/apache/superset/wiki/DAO-Style-Guidelines-and-Best-Practices) wiki page, and I hope there is general agreement in item 5 which mentions the \"shift left\" mentality where the data model should persist in the database schema than rely on Python logic per the SQLAlchemy ORM. The beauty of this approach is it simplifies the codebase and mental model and ensures that the correct logic is adhered to if/when executing SQL outside of the ORM (be that using the SQLAlchemy bulk workflows, executing SQL against the DB-API, using the MySQL/PostgreSQL CLI, etc.).\r\n\r\nThe logic I employed follows [this](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/orm/cascades.html#using-foreign-key-on-delete-cascade-with-orm-relationships) SQLAlchemy documentation. Per their suggestion I opted for `passive_deletes=True` as we don't require the ORM to load the columns, metrics, and owners (if lazy loaded) when deleting the dataset.\r\n\r\nThe TL;DR is prior to adding the migration CI was failing so it seems like this approach feels somewhat correct.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n###

SUMMARY\r\nFixes https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/23295\r\n\r\nSame issue discussion on domain sharding feature implementation PR - https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/5039\r\n\r\nAfter enabling the domain sharding as follows\r\n\r\n    ENABLE_CORS = True\r\n    CORS_OPTIONS = {\r\n      'supports_credentials': True,\r\n      'allow_headers': '*',\r\n      'resources': '*',\r\n      'origins': ['https://dashboards.mydomain.com','https://dashboards1.mydomain.com','https://dashboards2.mydomain.com','https://dashboards3.mydomain.com']\r\n    }\r\n    SUPERSET_WEBSERVER_DOMAINS=['dashboards.mydomain.com','dashboards1.mydomain.com','dashboards2.mydomain.com','dashboards3.mydomain.com']\r\nAll 4 webserver domains are set via DNS A record to the same IP address.\r\n\r\nWhen navigating to a dashboard, I can see in the Edge devtools, that the /api/v1/chart/data requests are sent to all webserver domains. However, they all fail with \"401\" (unauthenticated). I can also see, that some of the requests have a response set to {\"msg\":\"Missing Authorization Header\"}.\r\n\r\n### EXPECTED RESULT\r\nDomain sharding uses the 4 configured webserver domains for requesting data - and uses the session cookie of original domain for authentication.\r\n\r\n### ACTUAL RESULT\r\nThe authentication of the non-original webserver domains does not work and the requests are not authenticated.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\nPlease verify changes from my fork. \r\nAfter setting the `SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN` to main domain in `superset_config.py` authrization should work on all the domain shards. \r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [x] Has associated issue: Fixes https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/23295\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible\r\n  - [ ] Confirm DB migration upgrade and downgrade tested\r\n  - [ ] Runtime estimates and downtime expectations provided\r\n- [ ] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or API\r\n","created_at":"2023-06-22T09:19:43Z","updated_at":"2024-03-08T17:29:56Z","closed_at":"2023-10-04T18:37:53Z","merged_at":"2023-10-04T18:37:53Z","merge_commit_sha":"87c8e872eec29ac194fb803744b339b42ac20949","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"rusackas","id":812905,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMjkwNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/812905?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas","html_url":"https://github.com/rusackas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1329183122,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzI5MTgzMTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/size/XS","name":"size/XS","color":"E2D8FF","default":false,"description":""},{"id":6578403540,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAlosUs8AAAABiBp41A","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/%F0%9F%8F%B7%EF%B8%8F%20bot","name":"🏷️

SUMMARY\r\nWe have an usecase to set up CeleryBeat for alerts and that need some configurations in CeleryConfig object.
