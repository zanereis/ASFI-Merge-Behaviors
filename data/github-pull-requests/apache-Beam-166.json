Cleanup the code of `sdk_worker.py` on register process boundle descriptor.\r\n- Correct the implementation of Fn API, i.e., would be better to cater to the asynchronous design principles of the Beam API.\r\n\r\nChanges\r\n - 6868333: \r\n \tUpdate the client side implementation of Fn API to make sure registration is executed successfully before executing process_bundle. Personally I think that the client side implementation of Fn API should not assume that the implementation of registration in SDK harness is synchronous. The registration API itself is asynchronous and the client side implementation should check if the registration succeed. This will decouple the implementation dependency between the runner and the SDK harness.\r\n\r\n - 79d21b1:\r\n \tRemove duplicate registration logic in the Python SDK harness.  It changed the registration implementation of Python SDK harness to asynchronous.\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

uses the serialized key in stateful ExecutableStages to key partition the\r\ndata. When state requests are issued from the SDK Harness the key is also sent\r\nover serialized. However, the binary representation of that key currently does\r\nnot always match Flink's representation. This causes troubles with persisting\r\nkeyed state for checkpoints.\r\n\r\nWhen the key coder is known by the Runner, then it uses the same encoding scheme\r\nas the SDK Harness. However, when the coder is unknown, it will be replaced by a\r\n\"LengthPrefixCoder<ByteArrayCoder>\" which is problematic because the SDK Harness\r\ndoes not add this coder and thus may produce a different encoding as the Runner.\r\n\r\nThe solution is to add a LengthPrefixCoder around unknown coders in the\r\nExecutableStagePayload ahead of time, such that the SDK Harness will length\r\nprefix the key correctly.\r\n\r\nWithout this patch, I'm getting the following when Python's FastPrimitivesCoder has been used for encoding a key for a state request:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCaused

current buffer logic for items emitted during checkpointing is faulty in the\r\nsense that the buffer is partitioned on the output keys of the operator. The key\r\nmay be changed or even be dropped. Thus, the original key partitioning will not\r\nbe maintained which will cause checkpointing to fail.\r\n\r\nAn alternative solution would be BEAM-6733 / #9652, but this change keeps the\r\ncurrent buffering logic in place. The output buffer may now always be\r\nredistributed round-robin upon restoring from a checkpoint. Note that this is\r\nfine because no assumption can be made about the distribution of output elements\r\nof a DoFn operation.\r\n\r\nBackport of #9980.\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

current buffer logic for items emitted during checkpointing is faulty in the\r\nsense that the buffer is partitioned on the output keys of the operator. The key\r\nmay be changed or even be dropped. Thus, the original key partitioning will not\r\nbe maintained which will cause checkpointing to fail.\r\n\r\nAn alternative solution would be BEAM-6733 / #9652, but this change keeps the\r\ncurrent buffering logic in place. The output buffer may now always be\r\nredistributed round-robin upon restoring from a checkpoint. Note that this is\r\nfine because no assumption can be made about the distribution of output elements\r\nof a DoFn operation.\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

coder of WindowedValue cannot be configured and it’s always FullWindowedValueCoder. We don't need to serialize the timestamp, window and pane properties in Flink and so it will be better to make the coder configurable (i.e. allowing to use ValueOnlyWindowedValueCoder)\r\n\r\nDetail changes:\r\n- Add ValueOnlyWindowedValueCoder into MODEL_CODER so that we can use value only coder between runner and harness.\r\n- To make it configurable and also maybe for other configurations in futher(i.e., more general), we add a `configurations` map in Components.\r\n- Add python ValueOnlyWindowedValueCoder.\r\n\r\nSome concerns reviewers may have:\r\n- Do we have any other options instead of adding the configurations in Components(beam_runner_api.proto).\r\n  Yes, we have other options. For example, we can add some flags in the methods when call `addSdkWireCoder` and `addRunnerWireCoder`. However, the call stack is very deep(from DefaultJobBundleFactory.forStage() to WireCoders.addSdkWireCoder()). It would be a mess if we add a flag for all these methods.\r\n- The current changes are not used in Beam project.\r\n  Due to the doFn can emit timestamp in beam, it seems we can't tell when we can ignore encode or decode the timestamp field, i.e., currently, we only use FullWindowedValueCoder in Beam. However, in Flink we don't have such problem and can make use of the ValueOnlyWindowedValueCoder.\r\n- Have not add support for other SDKs(go)?\r\n  Maybe we can add support for other SDKs later when we find it is useful?\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master branch)\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nLang | SDK | Apex |

https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/9900 I migrated the rabbitmq amqp client from the 4.x line to the 5.x line. This upgrade removed the deprecated `QueueingConsumer` so I switched to a pull-based rather than push-based api.\r\n\r\nIt turns out this change had a semantic difference. The `channel.basicGet` (pull) is a blocking call. If no messages are delivered to the caller for a long period of time (for example, if no messages have been published to rabbit for some time), the Runner may detect that the reader is stuck and fail with:\r\n\r\n>  java.io.IOException: Failed to advance source: ...\r\n\r\nSo it seems it's imperative to use a non-blocking read.\r\n\r\nIn hindsight, upgrading libraries *and* migrating API approaches was too much to tackle at once. I suspect it's possible to appropriately utilize the pull-based API with RPC timeouts while keeping the channel open, but that shouldn't be a blocker to having *just* upgraded the libraries.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I restore the 4.x `QueueingConsumer` implementation, brought into Beam's code base, and use that just like we did before the library upgrade. The minor differences are documented.\r\n\r\nR: @jbonofre \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Without 'docker pull', we won't update the local image\r\nwith the remote image (for the same tag) but it shouldn't be a problem\r\nin prod that the unique tag is assumed for each released version.\r\n\r\nThis will also fix BEAM-8534.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR adds the PTuple, which is analogous to Java's PCollectionTuple.\r\n\r\nThis is a very useful output type for composites that want to emit multiple PCollections where each have their own producer. This is a fundamentally different type and a more general type than the DoOutputsTuple. The DoOutputsTuple assumes a single producer for all of its PCollections; this does not.\r\n\r\nThis is being used in https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/9953.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR adds support for multiple outputs with independent output watermarks for the TestStream.

Update the push-down rule to perform predicate push-down for IOs that do not support project push-down.\r\n- Update the `BeamCalcRel#beamComputeSelfCost` method to favor programs with smaller predicates.\r\n- Fixed a bug when selecting a field more than once to not drop the calc, since IOs cannot duplicate projected fields. Also added test cases to ensure expected behavior from `Project`, `Filter`, `ProjectAndFilter` push-downs.\r\n- PushDownRule should not be applied to IO `Rel`s more than once.\r\n- Create a `BeamPushDownIOSourceRel`.\r\n\r\nOther changes:\r\n- Rename `TestTableProviderWithFilterPushDown` to `TestTableProviderWithFilterAndProjectPushDown`, since it tests when both are supported.\r\n- Created a new file `TestTableProviderWithFilterPushDown` to test when only filter push-down is supported.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/d400848b3ead1a5cf4093328a6ea73082c60823039250d104fd0d588@%3Cdev.beam.apache.org%3E\r\n\r\nProblem: a trigger can \"finish\" which causes a window to \"close\" and drop\r\nall remaining data arriving for that window.\r\n\r\nThis has been discussed many times and I thought fixed, but it seems to not\r\nbe fixed. It does not seem to have its own Jira or thread that I can find.\r\nBut here are some pointers:\r\n\r\n - data loss bug:\r\nhttps://lists.apache.org/thread.html/ce413231d0b7d52019668765186ef27a7ffb69b151fdb34f4bf80b0f@%3Cdev.beam.apache.org%3E\r\n - user hitting the bug:\r\nhttps://lists.apache.org/thread.html/28879bc80cd5c7ef1a3e38cb1d2c063165d40c13c02894bbccd66aca@%3Cuser.beam.apache.org%3E\r\n - user confusion:\r\nhttps://lists.apache.org/thread.html/2707aa449c8c6de1c6e3e8229db396323122304c14931c44d0081449@%3Cuser.beam.apache.org%3E\r\n - thread from 2016 on the topic:\r\nhttps://lists.apache.org/thread.html/5f44b62fdaf34094ccff8da2a626b7cd344d29a8a0fff6eac8e148ea@%3Cdev.beam.apache.org%3E\r\n\r\nIn theory, trigger finishing was intended for users who can get their\r\nanswers from a smaller amount of data and then drop the rest. In practice,\r\ntriggers aren't really expressive enough for this. Stateful DoFn is the\r\nsolution for these cases.\r\n\r\nI've opened https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/9942 which makes the\r\nfollowing changes:\r\n\r\n - when a trigger says it is finished, it never fires again but data is\r\nstill kept\r\n - at GC time the final output will be emitted\r\n\r\nAs with all bugfixes, this is backwards-incompatible (if your pipeline\r\nrelies on buggy behavior, it will stop working). So this is a major change\r\nthat I wanted to discuss on dev@.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

[BEAM-8507] Add '[auto]' as a supported execution mode for Python FlinkRunner\r\n\r\nThis mode is necessary for the execution to work in a predefined environment\r\nwhere the Flink master address is available, i.e. when a jar is directly\r\nsubmitted against the Flink cluster or the job server has been pre-configured\r\nwith a master address.\r\n\r\n* [BEAM-8507] Support http protocol scheme for Flink master address\r\n\r\nPython uses the requests library to communicate with the Flink master via the\r\nREST API and requires a protocol scheme.\r\n\r\nDespite also using the REST API, the Java client does not expect the master\r\naddress to contain a protocol scheme. In order to support Python specifying one\r\nin Python, we can remove it in Java.\r\n\r\n* [BEAM-8507] Ensure that Python FlinkRunner execution works for all deployment scenarios\r\n\r\n**Please** add a meaningful description for your change here\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

[BEAM-8513](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-8513) it seems there's no way to utilize an already-existing exchange as Beam's RabbitMqIO will always attempt to declare it, and it does so with `durable=false`. In some brokers, like qpid, this is fine, but it rabbit if you attempt to declare a queue or exchange with different properties than the existing one (e.g. if the existing is durable and the declaration is not) then the declaration fails.\r\n\r\nFurther, a lot of the documentation about how to work with rabbit and amqp is misleading or flat out incorrect. The assertion that one 'interacts with a queue *or* interacts with an exchange' is false; one always: reads from a queue; registers the queue with the exchange; and binds messages to the queue (typically based on routing key). The documentation around interacting with a queue exclusively seems to be oriented around how a 'direct exchange' operates, and may only work with the default exchange. \r\n\r\nThe changes in this PR:\r\n- Updates documentation and tests to be more exchange-oriented, as rabbit has many routing paradigms and exchanges with routing keys is the common thread between them.\r\n- Introduces an `exchangeDeclare` property in `Read`\r\n- adds a separate `withExchange` function in `Builder` and enforces exchange declaration invariants accordingly\r\n\r\nWhile writing a test for the case of BEAM-8513 (attempting to force a failure when declaring a non-durable exchange when a durable one of the same name already exists) I found qpid did not fail this case. I took the opportunity to upgrade the qpid broker to the latest, as the previous version is now over six years old. This did not solve the problem, but a more modern library seems advantageous.\r\n\r\nFull test changes:\r\n- upgrading to the latest version of qpid\r\n- extracting parts of the rabbitmq test so that utilities and test declarations are moved to separate files/classes for re-use and documentation\r\n- added more test coverage for some configuration options, including invariants and different exchange/routing types\r\n\r\nR: @jbonofre \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR is adding SqsIO v2 to amazon-web-services2 submodule, and which uses AWS SDK V2. There are a few changes comparing to SqsIO V1: \r\n1. Adding SendMessageRequestCoder, since it's not serializable in SDK V2\r\n2. Adding MessageCoder, since it's not serializable in SDK V2\r\n3. Adding a custom SqsMessage, since the `attributes` of the `Message` is not serializable, and to return attributes to downstream users. We will get an exception `DefaultSdkContructionMap is not serializable` if we don't do this. \r\n4. Refactor unit test: have a separate class for EmbeddedSqlServer\r\n5. Remove SqsConfiguration class, and add withXXX methods() to take in AwsSecretsProvider\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
