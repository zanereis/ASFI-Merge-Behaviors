I introduced `run_mvn`, which broke the travis watchdog (it killed the mvn wrapper script, not maven)\r\n2. we saw a lot of successful builds with exit code 143, and a timeout report somewhere in between\r\n3. I opened a PR to properly kill mvn, using the default 300 seconds timeout.\r\n4. we saw a lot of mvn invocations timing out after 300 seconds.\r\n5. this PR is increasing the timeout to 900 seconds. It should make the build a lot more stable, at the cost of rare slow builds. \r\nThe real underlying issue here is the network stability of our CI servers.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- increase timeout to 900 seconds.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nTested on personal CI with a test that blocks for 25 minutes:

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR makes it possible to use safely use spawned threads in the `OperatorCoordinator`\r\n\r\n### The Previous Issue\r\n\r\nBefore, calls on the `Context` in the `OperatorCoordinator` went directly synchronously to the `ExcutionGraph`. That introduces two critical problems are:\r\n\r\n  - It is common that the code in the `OperatorCoordinator` runs in a separate thread (for example, because it executes blocking operations). In fact, the *FLIP-27* Source Enumerators do that. Calling the scheduler from another thread causes the Scheduler to crash (Assertion Error, violation of single threaded property)\r\n  - Calls on the `ExecutionGraph` are removed as part of removing the legacy scheduler. Certain calls do not work any more.\r\n\r\n### Problem Level 1:\r\n\r\nThe natural solution would be to pass in the scheduler and a main thread executor to interact with it.\r\n\r\nHowever, to do that the scheduler needs to be created before the Operator Coordinators are created. One could do that by creating the Coordinators lazily after the Scheduler.\r\n\r\n### Problem Level 2:\r\n\r\nThe Scheduler restores the savepoints as part of the scheduler creation, when the `ExecutionGraph` and the `CheckpointCoordinator` are created early in the constructor.\r\n(Side note: That design is tricky in itself, because it means state is restored before the scheduler is even properly constructed.)\r\n\r\nThat means the `OperatorCoordinator` needs to exist (or an in placeholder component needs to exist) to accept the restored state.\r\n\r\nThat brings us to a cyclic dependency:\r\n\r\n  - `OperatorCoordinator` (context) needs `SchedulerNG` and `MainThreadExecutor`\r\n  - `SchedulerNG` and `MainThreadExecutor` need a constructed `ExecutionGraph`\r\n  - `ExecutionGraph` needs `CheckpointCoordinator`\r\n  - `CheckpointCoordinator` needs `OperatorCoordinator`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log (a.k.a. Breaking the Cycle)\r\n\r\nThe only way we can currently solve this (without a massive scheduler refactoring) is with a form of lazy initialization:\r\n\r\n  - We eagerly create the `OperatorCoordinators` so they exist for state restore\r\n  - We provide an *uninitialized* `Context` to them\r\n  - When the `SchedulerNG` is started (after leadership is granted) we initialize the `Context` with the (then readily constructed) `SchedulerNG` and `MainThreadExecutor`\r\n\r\n## Suggested Follow-up (A longer-term Solution)\r\n\r\nThe longer term solution would require a major change in the `DefaultScheduler` and `CheckpointCoordinator` setup. Something like this:\r\n\r\n  - `DefaultScheduler` (and `ExecutionGraph`) are constructed first\r\n  - `JobMaster` waits for leadership\r\n  - Upon leader grant, `Operator Coordinators` (they are part of the `JobMaster`) are constructed and can reference the `SchedulerNG` and `FencedMainThreadExecutor`\r\n  - `CheckpointCoordinator` is constructed and references `ExecutionGraph` and `OperatorCoordinators`\r\n  - Savepoint or latest checkpoint is restored\r\n\r\n\r\nThe implementation in this PR tries to couple parts as loosely as possible to make it easy to implement the above approach later.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is an internal refactor of existing components. The contracts are tested by existing unit tests.\r\n\r\nThe fact that a separate thread can be used in the `OperatorCoordinator` is tested in an INtegration Test Case in a follow-up PR, about end-to-end coordinator exactly-once guarantees.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency):

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n***This PR is a re-pick of https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/12134 and rebased it to the latest master for merging again.***\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR introduced the Hadoop-path-based part file writer that supports writing data to specific Hadoop path. With this writer the data is first written to a temporary in-progress path and then commit to the final path with renaming. This PR supports streaming Hive sink to reuse the StreamingFileSink to write files. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- a97fc8c941cec48fa6756d898bf01afea15a37d2 introduces the haoop-path-based part file writer.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n  - Added test that validates the data is successfully written.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): **no**\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR is to set the default value of jobmanager.execution.failover-strategy to region.\r\nThe DefaultScheduler now already uses \"region\" as the default

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently, when we deploy a Flink application cluster(e.g. Yarn, K8s), `C/-classpath`  could not work properly. Since we override the `PipelineOptions.CLASSPATHS`  in `YarnApplicationClusterEntrypoint`  and `KubernetesApplicationClusterEntrypoint`. Then client updated configuration will not take effect.\r\n\r\n```\r\n./bin/flink run-application -p 5 -t yarn-application\\\r\n--classpath file:///flink/shared/dependency.jar ... \\\r\n-Dtaskmanager.memory.process.size=4096m \\\r\nexamples/streaming/StateMachineExample.jar\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* Add `getClasspath` to combine the user specified classpath and program classpath\r\n* Wire the `getClasspath` to all deployment\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n* Manually test on K8s/Yarn cluster\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (**yes** / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThe legacy JDBC and HBase table source support projection push down. In order to make the user experience consistent. We should align the behavior and add tests. Otherwise, users may be superised when upgrade to new connector but the performance is regressive. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- improve the testing implementation of projection push down (merge `TestProjectableValuesTableFactory` into  `TestValuesTableFactory`).\r\n- Add `TableSchemaUtil#projectSchema` to let connector can easily get the projected schema.\r\n- Make the new jdbc and hbase source have the ability to push projections\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- Added plan tests \r\n- The projection pushdown integeration tests have already existed. \r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added a test which transforms a nested data type.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis pull request is to provide a Kafka Source/Sink pair to simulate a KafkaShuffle that can:\r\n1. Read topics that are already partitioned by key and process them without partitioning them again (avoid shuffles); and\r\n2. Use this to decompose the job into smaller jobs and independent pipelined regions that failover independently.\r\n\r\n## Brief Change Log\r\n  - Extend Datastream API to allow user-defined SinkFunction to manipulate watermark\r\n  - Kafka Shuffle Producer change\r\n    - Write timestamp and watermark information together with a record in Kafka\r\n    - Use `KeyGroupRangeAssignment` to assign records to different Kafka partitions\r\n  - Kafka Shuffle Consumer change, Kafka Fechter Change\r\n    - Each consumer read partitions equal to the key group indices that it got assigned. For now, the number of partitions is enforced to equal to the number of consumer parallelism.\r\n    - KafkaShuffleFechter encapsulates the logic of record emitting and watermark emitting. \r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nThis change added tests:\r\n1. End-2-end tests\r\n2. partition assignment tests\r\n\r\nSome other tests are missing:\r\n1. Specific watermark tests\r\n2. failover tests\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes)\r\n  - The serializers: (don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nSince SQL dialect is already a table config option, we don't need to support it in `ExecutionEntry`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Remove the dialect config from `ExecutionEntry`.\r\n  - Refactor test to cover switching dialect in a session.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nUpdated test case\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWhen we upgrade the log4j to log4j2, there are some residual log4j logger configuration in the comments. Just like following,\r\n\r\nlog4j.properties and log4j-console.properties\r\n```\r\n# Uncomment this if you want to _only_ change Flink's logging\r\n#log4j.logger.org.apache.flink=INFO\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe should update them to the log4j2 format.\r\n ```\r\n# Uncomment this if you want to _only_ change Flink's logging\r\nlogger.flink.name = org.apache.flink\r\nlogger.flink.level = INFO\r\n```\r\n","created_at":"2020-05-18T08:29:25Z","updated_at":"2020-10-16T10:36:50Z","closed_at":"2020-05-18T09:45:52Z","merged_at":"2020-05-18T09:45:52Z","merge_commit_sha":"dc3efe1943d8347bbafffcbf7b98ae53363384b6","assignee":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273239272,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMjM5Mjcy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=CommandLineClient","name":"component=CommandLineClient","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/12214/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/12214/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/12214/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/78d9cd9f70ac69a78f6d045d998a004492ce4cfe","head":{"label":"wangyang0918:FLINK-17618-log4j2-comments","ref":"FLINK-17618-log4j2-comments","sha":"78d9cd9f70ac69a78f6d045d998a004492ce4cfe","user":{"login":"wangyang0918","id":15904523,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTA0NTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15904523?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918","html_url":"https://github.com/wangyang0918","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":205999027,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDU5OTkwMjc=","name":"flink","full_name":"wangyang0918/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wangyang0918","id":15904523,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTA0NTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15904523?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918","html_url":"https://github.com/wangyang0918","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyang0918/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangya

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nPreviously, the abstraction provided by `CompositeTypeSerializerSnapshot` only allows a mismatch in the outer configuration of composite serializers to be resolved as incompatible (restore fails) or compatible (restore continues as is). The resolution logic is captured as a `isOuterSnapshotCompatible` method, returning a flag.\r\n\r\nA requirement to additionally allow migration based on the outer configuration has came up in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-16998.\r\n\r\nThis PR extends functionality of the abstraction by deprecating the old `boolean isOuterSnapshotCompatible(serializer)`, in favor of a new `OuterSchemaCompatibility resolveOuterSchemaCompatibility(serializer)`.\r\n\r\nThe change is backwards compatible - existing subclasses are not broken API / behaviour wise.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- 2454f70 Deprecates old method in favor of new `resolveOuterSchemaCompatibility` method\r\n- 56f21c3 (not main change) Simplifies `CompositeTypeSerializerSnapshotTest`\r\n- 43c1758 Adds new unit test to verify that migration due to outer snapshot is respected\r\n- 1a2747b Remove all implementations of deprecated `isOuterSnapshotCompatible` in Flink\r\n- c91cdd3 Update docs\r\n\r\n## Verifying\r\n\r\nExisting tests (e.g. subclasses of `TypeSerializerUpgradeTestBase`) should cover this change.\r\nAn additional unit test in `CompositeTypeSerializerSnapshotTest` was also added for this.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): NO\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: **YES**\r\n  - The serializers: **YES**\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): NO\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: NO\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: NO\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? YES\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFix the broken link in the

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAdd task name to the executor thread and to all method of ChannelStateWriter (as they can be called from any other thread), such that log statements can be connected to the respective task.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR is part of the [FLINK-14807](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-14807) which is going to introduce a collecting method for tables. See [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13Ata18-e89_hAdfukzEJYreOg2FBZO_Y0RohLDAme6Y/edit) for the whole design document.\r\n\r\nCurrently Flink uses accumulators to fetch batch query results and sockets for streaming query results. These methods has the following disadvantages:\r\n* accumulators might become very large and eat up JM's memory;\r\n* sink might not be able to communicate directly with client through socket, for example under a Yarn / k8s execution environment.\r\n\r\nThis PR combines the previous 3 PRs which uses coordinators in JM as proxy between clients and sinks, so that collecting query results are supported under all execution and network environments with any amount of results.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n - Change current result collecting method to support collecting query results under all execution and network environments\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests (all tests calling `TableResults#collect` will cover this PR).\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? not applicable\r\n","created_at":"2020-05-17T14:04:14Z","updated_at":"2020-10-16T10:36:36Z","closed_at":"2020-05-18T08:54:24Z","merged_at":"2020-05-18T08:54:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"cfeaedd9df677b90c8e31214ca7704eead4e6655","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273055469,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMDU1NDY5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=API/DataStream","name":"component=API/DataStream","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1285080206,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjg1MDgwMjA2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/Planner","name":"component=TableSQL/Planner","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/12202/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/12202/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/12202/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/3d70dafb893db6a61dcbc1b614349e9164aafeab","head":{"label":"tsreaper:FLINK-14807.4","ref":"FLINK-14807.4","sha":"3d70dafb893db6a61dcbc1b614349e9164aafeab","user":{"login":"tsreaper","id":19909549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5OTA5NTQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19909549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsreaper","html_url":"https://github.com/tsreaper","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsreaper/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsreaper/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsreaper/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsreaper/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsreaper/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsreaper/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsreaper/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsreaper/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsreaper/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"1892bedeea9fa118b6e3bcb572f63c2e7f6d83e3","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":20587599,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDU4NzU5OQ==","name":"flink","full_name":"apache/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Fix all of the broken links in Flink docs master mentioned in [[FLINK-17353](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-17353)]*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Add flink-architecture.zh.md Chinese documents matching English documents*\r\n  - *Fix all of the broken links in [FLINK-17353] and redirect those links to the right pages*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / **not documented**)\r\n","created_at":"2020-05-17T07:21:25Z","updated_at":"2020-10-16T10:49:57Z","closed_at":"2020-05-19T07:45:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"727ecac502fbff78bb99c61121692c563d607719","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1272994186,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MTg2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Documentation","name":"component=Documentation","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1278841078,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjc4ODQxMDc4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=chinese-translation","name":"component=chinese-translation","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/12196/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/12196/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/12196/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/19f5ffd8eea4707770617a5349a3ef4275708a30","head":{"label":"yangyichao-mango:FLINK-17353","ref":"FLINK-17353","sha":"19f5ffd8eea4707770617a5349a3ef4275708a30","user":{"login":"yangyichao-mango","id":29545877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NTQ1ODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29545877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangyichao-mango","html_url":"https://github.com/yangyichao-mango","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangyichao-mango/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangyichao-mango/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangyichao-mango/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangyichao-mango/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangyichao-mango/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangyichao-mango/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangyichao-mango/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangyichao-mango/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangyichao-mango/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":259631443,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNTk2MzE0NDM=","name":"flink","full_name":"yangyichao-mango/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yangyichao-mango","id":29545877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NTQ1ODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29545877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangyichao-mango","html_url":"https://github.com/yangyichao-mango","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangyichao-mango/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangyichao-mango/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangyichao-mango/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangyichao-mango/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangyichao-mango/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangyichao-mango/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangyichao-mango/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangyichao-mango/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangyichao-mango/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yangyichao-mango/flink","description":"Apache

To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nTo implement ADD/DROP PARTITIONS for Hive dialect.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Add SqlNodes for add/drop partitions.\r\n  - Add AlterTableOperations for add/drop partitions.\r\n  - Hook up in the planner.\r\n  - Add test cases.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAdded test cases.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? yes\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? docs\r\n","created_at":"2020-05-17T05:55:59Z","updated_at":"2020-10-16T10:34:19Z","closed_at":"2020-05-17T13:07:08Z","merged_at":"2020-05-17T13:07:08Z","merge_commit_sha":"d3c39090a73aeb928c78ecd63e1fd6190c0df1f1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273410146,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczNDEwMTQ2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Connectors/Hive","name":"component=Connectors/Hive","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1289893384,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjg5ODkzMzg0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/API","name":"component=TableSQL/API","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/12195/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/12195/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/12195/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/df01ed84f55c8d5d10199d60ca4c3702ca6a22bd","head":{"label":"lirui-apache:FLINK-17449","ref":"FLINK-17449","sha":"df01ed84f55c8d5d10199d60ca4c3702ca6a22bd","user":{"login":"lirui-apache","id":5210788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTA3ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5210788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache","html_url":"https://github.com/lirui-apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":65453317,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NTQ1MzMxNw==","name":"flink","full_name":"lirui-apache/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lirui-apache","id":5210788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTA3ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5210788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache","html_url":"https://github.com/lirui-apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lirui-apache/flink","description":"Mirror

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nKeep the default planner in the prompt consistent with the code.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nChange tips about the default planner to blink when the planner parameter value is not recognized , because this default planner has been set to blink in the code.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\ntrivial change\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable)\r\n","created_at":"2020-05-17T03:56:49Z","updated_at":"2020-10-16T10:34:38Z","closed_at":"2020-05-17T14:54:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cc61518eec4bc51bedc4724c3842c1935c8b9376","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1272995158,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk1MTU4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Examples","name":"component=Examples","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/12194/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/12194/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/12194/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/b646f1df4c1dc9797662fac8fe7f54c6a3de4682","head":{"label":"Shih-Wei-Hsu:FLINK-17764","ref":"FLINK-17764","sha":"b646f1df4c1dc9797662fac8fe7f54c6a3de4682","user":{"login":"Shih-Wei-Hsu","id":18167900,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTY3OTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18167900?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shih-Wei-Hsu","html_url":"https://github.com/Shih-Wei-Hsu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shih-Wei-Hsu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shih-Wei-Hsu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shih-Wei-Hsu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shih-Wei-Hsu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shih-Wei-Hsu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shih-Wei-Hsu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shih-Wei-Hsu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shih-Wei-Hsu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shih-Wei-Hsu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":259847949,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNTk4NDc5NDk=","name":"flink","full_name":"Shih-Wei-Hsu/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Shih-Wei-Hsu","id":18167900,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTY3OTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18167900?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shih-Wei-Hsu","html_url":"https://github.com/Shih-Wei-Hsu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shih-Wei-Hsu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shih-Wei-Hsu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shih-Wei-Hsu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shih-Wei-Hsu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shih-Wei-Hsu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shih-Wei-Hsu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shih-Wei-Hsu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shih-Wei-Hsu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shih-Wei-Hsu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Shih-Wei-Hsu/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\nObjective of this PR is to remove the following deprecated method and update related code:\r\n\r\n- RuntimeContext.getFoldingState(...)\r\n- OperatorStateStore.getSerializableListState(...)\r\n- OperatorStateStore.getOperatorState(...)\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\nNA\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nNA\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (**yes** / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / **don't know**)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / **don't know**)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / **don't know**)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / **don't know**)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThrough StreamOperatorWrapper an operator may already be closed while the StreamTask is still running. Notification might be relayed in that time from the task to the closed operator causing issues on operators reacting on completed checkpoints, such as two phase commit sinks.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- This commit adds the information of the closing to the wrapper and avoids relaying notifications to closed operators.\r\n- Also fixes a potential related issue in SubtaskCheckpointCoordinatorImpl#takeSnapshotSync.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n  - Added StreamTaskTest#testNotifyCheckpointOnClosedOperator\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (**not applicable** / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2020-05-15T20:51:42Z","updated_at":"2022-03-17T15:35:23Z","closed_at":"2020-05-19T13:09:44Z","merged_at":"2020-05-19T13:09:44Z","merge_commit_sha":"cbd9ca0ca3c6d2ff1ae36a7c3aa8f88d41506929","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273164140,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMTY0MTQw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Tests","name":"component=Tests","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1401080710,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDAxMDgwNzEw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Task","name":"component=Runtime/Task","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/12186/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/12186/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/12186/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/26b98ea10d229f1a49fbbc232dc5cdb83572ac3b","head":{"label":"AHeise:FLINK-16383","ref":"FLINK-16383","sha":"26b98ea10d229f1a49fbbc232dc5cdb83572ac3b","user":{"login":"AHeise","id":4559103,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NTkxMDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4559103?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise","html_url":"https://github.com/AHeise","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"af06c1940a4a36ed63be3288d760d0213d5a5ab8","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":20587599,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDU4NzU5OQ==","name":"flink","full_name":"apache/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis Pull Request is to fix the bug that REAPER_THREAD.start() failure in SafetyNetCloseableRegistry lead to the repeated failover, as described in [FLINK-17645](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-17645)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nReset `SafetyNetCloseableRegistry#REAPER_THREAD` if it fails to start \r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nAdd `testReaperThreadStartFailed` in `SafetyNetCloseableRegistryTest` for this case.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency):  **no**\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`:  **no**\r\n  - The serializers:  **no**\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive):  **no**\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: **no**\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: **no**\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?  **no**\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not

Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAdd client.timeout setting and use that for CLI operations\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nCurrently, the Cli uses the akka.client.timeout setting. This has historical reasons but can be very confusing for users. We should introduce a new setting client.timeout that is used for the client, with a fallback to the previous akka.client.timeout\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nAkkaUtilsTest.test(\"get client.timeout for the client, with a fallback to the akka.client.timeout.\") \r\npassed\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: ( no )\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: ( no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAdd new hbase connector implementation which uses new interfaces proposed by FLIP-95, e.g. DynamicTableSource, DynamicTableSink, and Factory.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- New `HBaseDynamicTableSource` and new `HBaseDynamicTableSink`.\r\n- New `HBaseDynamicTableFactory` which uses new connector options proposed by FLIP-122.\r\n- We reuses the implementation of `HBaseLookupFunction`.\r\n- Added `HBaseSerde` to support runtime conversion between `RowData` and HBase mutation.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- Added `HBaseDynamicTableFactory` to unit test factory\r\n- Added new connector test in `HBaseConnectorITCase`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (**not applicable** / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2020-05-15T14:29:32Z","updated_at":"2020-05-28T02:38:52Z","closed_at":"2020-05-16T15:27:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"045f5587812902fb5e6bc003ba82d6094c20390c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273421473,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczNDIxNDcz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Connectors/HBase","name":"component=Connectors/HBase","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1292353221,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjkyMzUzMjIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/Ecosystem","name":"component=TableSQL/Ecosystem","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/12178/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/12178/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/12178/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/1b75f1a3cdb3b9fb726c57bfe38d967eb9e60360","head":{"label":"wuchong:hbase-connector","ref":"hbase-connector","sha":"1b75f1a3cdb3b9fb726c57bfe38d967eb9e60360","user":{"login":"wuchong","id":5378924,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNzg5MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5378924?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong","html_url":"https://github.com/wuchong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":63797485,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2Mzc5NzQ4NQ==","name":"flink","full_name":"wuchong/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wuchong","id":5378924,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNzg5MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5378924?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong","html_url":"https://github.com/wuchong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wuchong/flink","description":"Mirror

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n\r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*This pull request introduce a new JDBC connector with new property keys which follows [FLIP-95](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/FLIP-95%3A+New+TableSource+and+TableSink+interfaces).*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - (1) introduce **JdbcDynamicTableSource**、**JdbcDynamicTableSink**、and new **Factory** to find them\r\n  - (2) introduce **JdbcDynamicInputFormat**、**JdbcDynamicOutputFormat** that use new internal data structure **RowData**\r\n- (3) introduce **JdbcDynamicLookupFunction** that we used to support` temporal table join.`\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n- (1) Add three ITCases **JdbcDynamicTableSoureITCase**、**JdbcDynamicTableSinkITCase**、**JdbcTemporayTableITCase**\r\n- (2) Add unit tests for **JdbcDynamicInputFormat** and **JdbcDynamicOutputFormat**\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): ( no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis pr add a flink cep example\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nMost code if from the [flink official website](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.10/dev/libs/cep.html) and I ran it locally to ensure it do work correctly.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency):(yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no**)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

e2e tests relying on flink-container/docker to [flink-docker|https://github.com/apache/flink-docker].\r\n\r\nThe changes mostly cover how the Docker image is built.\r\nWe now first create a custom Dockerfile, by checking out `flink-docker/dev-master` and using the `add-custom.sh` script. This requires the distribution to be accessible from some URL, so we tar the locally built distribution and server it with a local python webserver.\r\n\r\nFor job clusters, instead of backing in the job artifacts into the image we now use instead mount them into the `usrlib` directory, which is the new default approach.\r\n\r\nSome arguments had to be modified, since `flink-docker` closely follows the existing CLI scripts, which flink-container/docker did

PR builds on top of https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/12143 and adds the functionality described in the JIRA. It makes mandatory for users of the `yarn.provided.lib.dirs` option to also include the `lib/`, `plugin/` and `flink-dist jar`.\r\n\r\nIf these are not included among the shared resources, Flink will throw an exception and will inform the user to not use this feature, but ship all the dependencies of the application, as it was done previously.\r\n\r\nIf these dirs are provided, then these are going to be used to execute the application and **NOT** what the user may have locally (e.g. different flink or log4j versions).\r\n\r\nThe reason for this requirement is to avoid unpleasant surprises with classloading issues. Alternatively we could say to go case-by-case and say if the file to be shipped has the same name as one in the shared directories, then do not ship it and use the remote. But this way of doing things transparently to the user oftentimes leads to unpleasant surprises that are difficult to debug. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nMore of the changes are in the `YarnApplicationFileUploader`.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPartially covered by tests in the `YarnITCase` and also verified manually by me and @wangyang0918 .\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (**yes** / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (**yes** / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nWe need to add some custom labels on Prometheus, so we can query by them.\r\nNow we can add jobName\\groupingKey to PrometheusPushGatewayReporter in version 1.10, but not in PrometheusReporter.\r\nCan we add AbstractPrometheusReporter#addDimension method to support this, so they will be no differences except for the metrics exposing mechanism pulling/pushing.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- AbstractPrometheusReporter unify parseLabels method\r\n- AbstractPrometheusReporter add resolveDimensions method into notifyOfAddedMetric\r\n\r\n##

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nWhen starting the JavaGatewayServer, a callback client would also be created and run in a ScheduleExecutorService's thread which is non-daemon by default.

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nWhen starting the JavaGatewayServer, a callback client would also be created and run in a ScheduleExecutorService's thread which is non-daemon by default. Thus, we need to shut down the non-daemon thread and reset a daemon thread back to the call back client.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- shut down the non-daemon thread and reset a daemon thread back to the call back client in startGatewayServer() in PythonDriver.py.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis pull request can be verified by all pyflink table API tests which need to start the communication between python process and java process.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): ( no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: ( no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no )\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): ( no )\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: ( no )\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: ( no )\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently we rely on whether unaligned checkpoint is enabled to determine whether to read recovered states during task startup,  then it will block the requirements of recovery from previous unaligned states even though the current mode is aligned. \r\n\r\nWe can make `ChannelStateReader` provide the hint whether there are any channel states to be read during startup, then we will never lose any chances to recover from them.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Provide `ChannelStateReader#hasStates` interface methods and implements it in related instances.\r\n\r\n- Adjust the condition in `StreamTask#beforeInvoke` to reuse the new hint.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nnew unit test in `StreamTaskTest#testBeforeInvokeWithoutChannelStates`.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency):

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nTo implement FUNCTION & CATALOG DDLs for Hive dialect.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Implement the syntax\r\n  - Add test cases\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAdded test cases.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? yes\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n\r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*This pull request fix exception message  comparison logic in jdk11, this cause from jdk8 and jdk 1.11 have different Exception detail for same Exception.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *update file JdbcFullTest.java/JdbcOutputFormatTest.java*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): ( no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2020-05-14T16:00:36Z","updated_at":"2020-05-15T06:21:17Z","closed_at":"2020-05-15T06:21:17Z","merged_at":"2020-05-15T06:21:17Z","merge_commit_sha":"81d3e62884ee07266d5d4f54550e26e52dc7c529","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1278775149,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjc4Nzc1MTQ5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Connectors/JDBC","name":"component=Connectors/JDBC","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/12158/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/12158/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/12158/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/0328a87f455afee6923ff2b5bd004801cd73a457","head":{"label":"leonardBang:FLINK-17697","ref":"FLINK-17697","sha":"0328a87f455afee6923ff2b5bd004801cd73a457","user":{"login":"leonardBang","id":5163645,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNjM2NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5163645?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonardBang","html_url":"https://github.com/leonardBang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonardBang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonardBang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonardBang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonardBang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonardBang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonardBang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonardBang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonardBang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonardBang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":64203606,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NDIwMzYwNg==","name":"flink","full_name":"leonardBang/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"leonardBang","id":5163645,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNjM2NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5163645?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonardBang","html_url":"https://github.com/leonardBang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonardBang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonardBang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonardBang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonardBang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonardBang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonardBang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonardBang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonardBang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leonardBang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/leonardBang/flink","description":"Mirror

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR contains various small fixes and improvements for the `SourceOperator` implementation.\r\nNothing is any change in user-facing behavior, these are only improvements for better future maintenance.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n### (1) Simplify State Access in SourceOperator\r\n\r\nThe SourceOperator has some boiler plate code taking the bytes out of the `ListState<byte[]>` and applying the `SimpleVersionedSerializer` to turn them into the splits.\r\n\r\nThis change encapsulates that code in a utility class `SimpleVersionedListState<SplitT>` which wraps a `ListState<byte[]>` and applies the serialization and de-serialization.\r\n\r\n### (2) Initialization of the SourceOperator\r\n\r\nBefore this change, the `SourceOperator` takes a `Source` in the constructor.\r\nAll actual components that the `SourceOperator` relies on when working are lazily initialized, in `open()` or via setters. This change moves towards more eager initialization, as is the purpose of the new `SourceOperatorFactory`-based appraoch.\r\n\r\nRelying on something as broad as Source also means that a lot of redundant context has to be provided to the `SourceOperator` during initialization. The Source is, for example, also responsible for the `SourceEnumerator`, which is independent of the `SourceOperator`. However, it needed to be considered during testing, because the tests need to mock a full `Source` in order to instantiate a SourceOperator.\r\n\r\nThis change passes the collaborators of the `SourceOperator` directly eagerly into the constructor. It is not fully possible with the `SourceReader`, but for that we can still reduce the scope by passing a targeted factory function.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis PR does not change any behavior, only internal design. The functionality is already covered by existing unit tests. The PR adjusts the relevant teste where needed.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): **no**\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: **no**\r\n  - The serializers: **no**\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): **no**\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: **no**\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: **no**\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? **no**\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? **not

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently, we have `createTypeInformation` on `DynamicTableSource#Context`, but not on `DynamicTableSink#Context`.\r\nIn some sink connectors, we need to buffer the `RowData` and flush at some interval. So we need to copy the `RowData` if object reuse is enabled, then the internal TypeInformation is needed to get the RowData `TypeSerializer#copy`.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Add createTypeInformation to DynamicTableSink#Contxt\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- Add assert in `TestValuesTableSink#getSinkRuntimeProvider`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (**not applicable** / docs / JavaDocs / not

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Convert InfluxDB reporter to plugin,Set SPI configuration for reporter*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nIntroduce `DebeziumFormatFactory` and `CanalFormatFactory` to read changelogs.\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE my_table (\r\n  ...\r\n) WITH (\r\n  'connector'='...',  -- e.g. 'kafka'\r\n  'format'='debezium-json',\r\n  'debezium-json.schema-include'='true' -- default false, Debeizum can be configured to include or exclude the message schema\r\n  'debezium-json.ignore-parse-errors'='true' -- default false\r\n);\r\n\r\nCREATE TABLE my_table (\r\n  ...\r\n) WITH (\r\n 'connector'='...', -- e.g. 'kafka'\r\n 'format'='canal-json',\r\n 'canal-json.ignore-parse-errors'='true' -- default false\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Introduced `DebeziumJsonDeserializationSchema` and `DebeziumFormatFactory` to deserialize Debezium messages.\r\n- Introduced `CanalJsonDeserializationSchema` and `CanalFormatFactory` to deserialize Canal messages.\r\n- Throw exception in `DebeziumFormatFactory#createSinkFormat` and `CanalFormatFactory#createSinkFormat` to tell users they can't be as sink for now. \r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- Added `DebeziumJsonDeserializationSchemaTest` and `CanalsonDeserializationSchemaTest` to deserialize debezium messages and canal messages. \r\n- Added `DebeziumFormatFactoryTest` and `CanalFormatFactoryTest` to unit test factories. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis commit fixes the expression type when converting from a\r\nCallExpession to RexNode for Row, Map, Array constructors.\r\n\r\nIt also adds support for LegacyTypeInformationType in FlinkTypeFactory\r\nas it might end up there from the type inference.\r\n\r\nLastly it makes the Row, Map, Array ctors return not null type, as the\r\nctors can not produce a null.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAdded test `org.apache.flink.table.planner.runtime.stream.table.ValuesITCase#testRegisteringValuesWithComplexTypes`\r\n\r\nAll existing tests should pass.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (**not applicable** / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2020-05-14T10:42:24Z","updated_at":"2020-10-16T10:36:59Z","closed_at":"2020-05-18T09:57:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a61f1ad9a9d02eec332372d3b8ebbbaa615c4c51","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1289893384,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjg5ODkzMzg0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/API","name":"component=TableSQL/API","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/12149/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/12149/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/12149/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/fa262ac0db9fd73454093771e3c6c27649a9ab17","head":{"label":"dawidwys:FLINK-17681","ref":"FLINK-17681","sha":"fa262ac0db9fd73454093771e3c6c27649a9ab17","user":{"login":"dawidwys","id":6242259,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNDIyNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6242259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys","html_url":"https://github.com/dawidwys","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":43764900,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0Mzc2NDkwMA==","name":"flink","full_name":"dawidwys/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dawidwys","id":6242259,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNDIyNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6242259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys","html_url":"https://github.com/dawidwys","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dawidwys/flink","description":"Mirror

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis change introduces the new `TimestampAssigner` and `WatermarkGenerator`, along with the helper `WatermarkStrategy` and `WatermarkStrategies`. This is according to [FLIP-126](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/FLIP-126%3A+Unify+%28and+separate%29+Watermark+Assigners) for which we currently have a VOTE ongoing.\r\n\r\nThis is a mix of earlier work by @StephanEwen (https://github.com/StephanEwen/flink/commits/event_time), along with my additions/proposals. The individual commit messages describe quite well what is going on.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nThis does four (somewhat related) changes in multiple commits. Most of these are a commit by Stephan and then a couple of addons by me. The four bigger themes are:\r\n\r\n - adding the new basic interfaces `TimestampAssigner`/`WatermarkGenerator`\r\n - adding the factory `WatermarkStrategy`, along with common strategies and the `WatermarkStrategies` helper\r\n - changing `WatermarkStrategy` to also include the `TimestampAssigner`, which is not as originally intended by @StephanEwen \r\n - using the new interfaces for per-partition watermarking in the Kafka Connector. This uses adapters for still supporting the old-style interfaces\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- this adds test for newly introduced classes\r\n- the added Kafka code is verified by existing `AbstractFetcherTest` and ITCases. New tests were added specifically for `WatermarkGenerator` in the Kafka connector\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: yes\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): maybe, for the Kafka source\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? yes\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? No, I have yet to add documentation in `dev/event_timestamp_extractors.md`, `dev/event_timestamps_watermarks.md`, and `dev/connectors/kafka.md`.\r\n","created_at":"2020-05-14T09:05:37Z","updated_at":"2020-10-16T10:35:56Z","closed_at":"2020-05-18T04:53:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0ba290377c6a624db85b8877dd51e3acae668138","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"StephanEwen","id":1727146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjcxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1727146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen","html_url":"https://github.com/StephanEwen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephanEwen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273055469,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMDU1NDY5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=API/DataStream","name":"component=API/DataStream","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1735762977,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzM1NzYyOTc3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=API/Core","name":"component=API/Core","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/12147/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/12147/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/12147/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/d2e6bb8c6b1eafa29d77692eb0e62bdc9a50591b","head":{"label":"aljoscha:flink-xxx-wm-generators","ref":"flink-xxx-wm-generators","sha":"d2e6bb8c6b1eafa29d77692eb0e62bdc9a50591b","user":{"login":"aljoscha","id":68551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha","html_url":"https://github.com/aljoscha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22066189,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjA2NjE4OQ==","name":"flink","full_name":"aljoscha/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"aljoscha","id":68551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha","html_url":"https://github.com/aljoscha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/aljoscha/flink","description":"Mirror

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nBecause the `Configuration` in HBaseRowInputFormat cannot be serialized, the task cannot obtain the zk address set in the table parameter, which prevents the task from connecting to Hbase.   \r\nBecause the default value of `hbase.zookeeper.quorum` is localhost, the unit test is ok\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nFix failure to read hbase table\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nno\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n- this PR supports  read hbase conf dir from flink.conf just like hadoop_conf does\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n- i have verified in our production\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): ( no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAfter FLINK-13938, we could support to register remote shared libs as Yarn local resources and prevent unnecessary uploading and downloading for system Flink jars.\r\n\r\nHowever, we still need to specify a local user jar to run a Flink job on Yarn. This ticket aims to add the remote path support. It have at least two purposes.\r\n\r\n* Accelerate the submission\r\n* Better integration with application mode. Since the user main code is executed in the cluster(jobmanager), we do not need the user jar exists locally.\r\nA very typical use case is like following.\r\n\r\n```\r\n./bin/flink run-application -p 10 -t yarn-application \\\r\n-Dyarn.provided.lib.dirs=\"hdfs://myhdfs/flink/lib\" \\\r\nhdfs://myhdfs/jars/WindowJoin.jar\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* `a251fc` Always build the packaged program in the cluster for application mode\r\n* `9c3e41` Support to specify a remote path for job jar\r\n* `f257f9` Move some variables as member of YarnApplicationFileUploader to make it more self-contained\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n* New added unit tests\r\n* ITCase for Yarn application mode\r\n* Manually test in a real Yarn cluster\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (**yes** / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (**yes** / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (will add document in a separate ticket with all other application

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nDatadog limits how large a single request may be. If too large, Datadog returns a 413 and the metrics are not received. This pull request allows a user to set the maximum number of metrics to include in a single request to Datadog so they can control its size.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - Set `maxMetricsPerRequest` from config or default if not found\r\n  - Kept track of the number of metrics in each request iteration. Send the request when the max size has been met or no more metrics are left to add.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency):  no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive):  no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? not applicable

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis Pull Request contains a series of changes that ultimately serve two goals:\r\n\r\n  1. Complete checkpointing/restoring state for OperatorCoordinators (previously restores were not implemented)\r\n  2. Only restore operator coordinators on after \"global failures\" or \"global restore\".\r\n\r\nThe distinction between Global failures/restores and task failures/restores mean the following:\r\n  - When a task fails, then that task and others (in the same failover region) are restarted with the latest checkpoint state. In that case, the Operator Coordinators only get notifications, the coordinator is not reset to the previous checkpoint. That is because some subtasks may potentially continue to run.\r\n  - When a global failure happens (for example as part of a master failover, a change in JobManager leader status, or through the safety net in the scheduler) then all tasks are reset to the previous state, and likewise the coordinators are reset to the previous checkpoint. In those situations, there would be the danger inconistencies if the coordinator did not reset to the checkpoint.\r\n  - A restore from a savepoint is likewise a global restore (it is a special case of a change in leader status)\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nChanges 42f3576, ad78321, 16c1524, 2a3fabc, 5e8dfd8, e6063a8 are simple refactoring and fixes of minor bugs. These commits should be self contained not too complex.\r\n\r\n11bc22f improves the failure handling by sending failure notifications to the `OperatorCoordinator` as soon as a task failed, and not only when it gets recovered. That makes failure handling in the coordinator faster.\r\n\r\n6452bd9 simply forwards the exception that caused the failure originally to the `OperatorCoordinator.subtaskFailed()` method.\r\n\r\n40f9067 Completes the remainders of the checkpointing integration. It fixes various previous issues and makes sure that `restore()` is always called on the `OperatorCoordinator` whenever a checkpoint is restored.\r\n\r\na7e2a16 Introduces the two different methods in the `CheckpointCoordinator`:\r\n  - `restoreLatestCheckpointedStateToAll(...)` for restores after global failures. This is the same as the previous behavior. This method also restores `OperatorCoordinators`.\r\n  - `restoreLatestCheckpointedStateToSubtasks` for restores of (a subset of) subtasks only. The method is initially unused.\r\nThe commit also removes the `failIfNoCheckpoint`flag which was only used during savepoint restores. Because savepoint restores have their dedicated method in the `CheckpointCoordinator` this flag was never used in the production code and was not re-included in the two new methods.\r\n\r\n2c5bd3b Changes the scheduler to call the two different methods introduces in the previous commits in the respective situations (task failure versus global failure).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThe changes here are covered by various additional unit tests, specifically in the class `OperatorCoordinatorSchedulerTest`\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the

for RowData type\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nSupport AVRO serialization and deseriazation schema for RowData type\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Added AvroRowDataSerializationSchema\r\n- Added AvroRowDataDeserializationSchema\r\n- Support equals for GenericArrayData/GenericMapData/GenericRowData\r\n- Support deriving LogicalType from Avro Class/ Schema String in AvroSchemaConverter\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - *Added AvroRowDataDeSerializationSchemaTest*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (**yes** / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nMake the `PartFileWriter` generic and decouple the `PartFileWriter` and `RecoverableStream`. According to different pre-commit / commit methods, this change allows us to extend different types of `PartFileWriter`.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Change the `PartFileWriter` from `abstract` to `interface`*\r\n  - *Make the `PartWriterFactory` generic and depend on `InProgressFileRecoverable`/`PendingFileRecoverable` instead of `RecoverableFsDataOutputStream`*\r\n  - *Introduce the `OutputStreamBasedPartFileWriter` for `RecoverableFsDataOutputStream`*\r\n  - *Change the `Bucket`/`Buckets` depend on the `PartWriterFactory` instead of `RecoverableWriter`*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n  - *Added tests for BucketState compatibility。*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis fixes the following shortcomings in the new data structures:\r\n\r\n- The some data structures do not provide a hashCode/equals for testing.\r\n- `RawValueData` cannot be created from bytes.\r\n- Accessing elements requires dealing with logical types during runtime.\r\n- Null checks are performed multiple times during runtime even for types that are declared as NOT NULL.\r\n\r\nSo far these changes are not used. This will change in FLINK-16999.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nAdds `hashCode/equals` and specialized runtime instances by type for getting and setting values.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nTests are following in FLINK-16999.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: yes\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): yes\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nTo implement INSERT for Hive dialect.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Implement syntax.\r\n  - Add test cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nExisting and added tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? yes\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? docs\r\n","created_at":"2020-05-13T13:40:44Z","updated_at":"2020-05-15T02:27:18Z","closed_at":"2020-05-14T23:48:22Z","merged_at":"2020-05-14T23:48:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"74b8bb565c9e43d2deeef9ce60e9b642a23e1c2a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273410146,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczNDEwMTQ2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Connectors/Hive","name":"component=Connectors/Hive","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/12129/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/12129/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/12129/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/5624768b8baff32329975d39ba7174fe1c6fc62e","head":{"label":"lirui-apache:FLINK-17667","ref":"FLINK-17667","sha":"5624768b8baff32329975d39ba7174fe1c6fc62e","user":{"login":"lirui-apache","id":5210788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTA3ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5210788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache","html_url":"https://github.com/lirui-apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":65453317,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NTQ1MzMxNw==","name":"flink","full_name":"lirui-apache/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lirui-apache","id":5210788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTA3ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5210788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache","html_url":"https://github.com/lirui-apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lirui-apache/flink","description":"Mirror
