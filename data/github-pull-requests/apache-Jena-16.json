opposed to from a Java VM), you will need to <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/studio/write/java8-support.html#supported_features\">enable desugaring of Java 8 <em>language features</em></a> if you have not already done so. (And if you are releasing an Android <em>library</em>, then anyone who uses that library will also have to enable desugaring.) We had expected for nearly all Android projects to already be set up this way, but we have gotten a report of at least one that is not. If this causes problems for you, please let us know on <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/google/guava/issues/5358\">google/guava#5358</a>. We are figuring out our next steps.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Introduced a warning log message when running <code>guava-android</code> under a Java 7 VM. (Android VMs are unaffected.) This warning is not <em>guaranteed</em> to be logged when running under Java 7, so please don't rely on it as your only warning about future problems. If the warning <em>itself</em> causes you trouble, you can eliminate it by silencing the logger for <code>com.google.common.base.MoreObjects$ToStringHelper</code> (which is used <em>only</em> for this warning). This warning prepares for <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/google/guava/issues/5269\">removing support for Java 7 in 2021</a>. Please report any problems. We have tried to make the warning as safe as possible, but anytime a common library logs, there is the potential for <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/41017717/28465\"><code>NullPointerException</code></a> or even <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/48009613/28465\">deadlock</a>. (To be clear, Guava will <em>not</em> log under Java 8 or Android, but it <em>may</em> log under Java 7.) (dc52e6e385)</li>\n<li><code>base</code>: Deprecated <code>StandardSystemProperty.JAVA_EXT_DIRS</code>. We do not plan to remove the API, but note that, under recent versions of Java, that property always has a value of <code>null</code>. (38abf07772)</li>\n<li><code>net</code>: Added <code>HttpHeaders</code> constants for <code>Origin-Isolation</code> and <code>X-Request-ID</code>. (a48fb4f724, 8319d201cd)</li>\n<li><code>reflect</code>: Added <code>ClassInfo.isTopLevel()</code>.

added `visit` method to `Constraint` interface. I experimented with providing a default implementation (calling `visitor.visit(Constraint)`) to avoid having to add an implementation to all implementing classes. This approach does not work, which I did not expect. Learned something about Java method invocation target selection there.\r\n* added `visit` method non-abstract subclasses of `Constraint`. The pattern suggests they should be named `accept`, but jena uses `visit` wherever I checked. I guess it's better to stick with the existing flavor.\r\n* Currently no unit tests as there is no logic apart from `visitor.visit(this)`. Please let me know if you feel differently. Using the PR in my client code, so I'm positive it works.\r\n","created_at":"2020-12-07T13:19:23Z","updated_at":"2022-04-08T12:48:09Z","closed_at":"2020-12-08T11:55:53Z","merged_at":"2020-12-08T11:55:52Z","merge_commit_sha":"89e0070ad8f64aeff20c7464f2cea0207df91278","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/pulls/882/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/pulls/882/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/882/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/statuses/563a500af04896b495e513faf45a8cff53210c6a","head":{"label":"fkleedorfer:constraint-visitorpattern-JENA-2009","ref":"constraint-visitorpattern-JENA-2009","sha":"563a500af04896b495e513faf45a8cff53210c6a","user":{"login":"fkleedorfer","id":551624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTYyNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/551624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkleedorfer","html_url":"https://github.com/fkleedorfer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkleedorfer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkleedorfer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkleedorfer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkleedorfer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkleedorfer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkleedorfer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkleedorfer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkleedorfer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkleedorfer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":315723244,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMTU3MjMyNDQ=","name":"jena","full_name":"fkleedorfer/jena","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fkleedorfer","id":551624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTYyNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/551624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkleedorfer","html_url":"https://github.com/fkleedorfer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkleedorfer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkleedorfer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkleedorfer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkleedorfer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkleedorfer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkleedorfer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkleedorfer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkleedorfer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkleedorfer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fkleedorfer/jena","description":"Mirror

(David Smiley)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/locationtech/spatial4j/issues/194\">#194</a>: Circles that cross a dateline can now be converted to a JTS Geometry. Previous attempts would throw an exception.\n(Stijn Caerts)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/locationtech/spatial4j/issues/194\">#194</a>: JtsGeometry now supports input an Geometry that crosses the dateline multiple times (wraps the globe multiple times). Previous attempts would yield erroneous behavior.\n(Stijn Caerts)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/locationtech/spatial4j/issues/188\">#188</a>: Upgraded to JTS 1.17.0.  This JTS release has a small <a href=\"https://github.com/locationtech/jts/blob/master/doc/JTS_Version_History.md#api-changes\">API change</a> and it requires Java 1.8.\nSpatial4J should work fine with older versions still.\n(Jim Hughes)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/locationtech/spatial4j/issues/177\">#177</a>: Improve conversion of a Circle to Shape. JtsShapeFactory allows converting from a Shape\nobject to a JTS Geometry object. Geodetic circles now translate to a polygon that has points\nequidistant from the center. Before the change, there was potentially a large inaccuracy.\n(Hrishi Bakshi)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/locationtech/spatial4j/issues/163\">#163</a>: &quot;Empty&quot; points in JTS are now convertible to a Spatial4j Shape instead of throwing an exception.\n(David Smiley)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/locationtech/spatial4j/issues/162\">#162</a>: Fixed WKT &amp; GeoJSON [de]serialization of &quot;empty&quot; points and geometrycollections.\n(Jeen Broekstra, David Smiley)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/locationtech/spatial4j/issues/165\">#165</a>: Added ShapeFactory.pointLatLon convenience method.\n(MoeweX)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/locationtech/spatial4j/issues/167\">#167</a>: WKTWriter now has a means to customize the NumberFromat.\n(MoeweX)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/locationtech/spatial4j/issues/175\">#175</a>: ShapesAsWKTModule, a Jackson databind module,\ndidn't deserialize WKT inside JSON to a Spatial4j Shape at all.\nNow it does.  It continues to serialize correctly.\n(David Smiley)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/locationtech/spatial4j/commit/8704d9ca3e3c96202464b6609028124d59f34c66\"><code>8704d9c</code></a> [maven-release-plugin] prepare release spatial4j-0.8</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/locationtech/spatial4j/commit/c9ccdf6fa3643b19605c42771bc0cbb4062523ab\"><code>c9ccdf6</code></a> pom.xml: plugin version tweaks</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/locationtech/spatial4j/commit/1f6e2047f0574a430fc711cf2cd5adf141a8bda9\"><code>1f6e204</code></a> Lang: resolve unchecked generics</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/locationtech/spatial4j/commit/082c7c64a0cc5886f32e01ee8d026c4cf48d977c\"><code>082c7c6</code></a> Lang: Remove redundant generic types</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/locationtech/spatial4j/commit/80f5d3f97e0f72ad355b3a7b205e4cc3873379fe\"><code>80f5d3f</code></a> javadoc: Un-declare javadoc params/throws without docs</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/locationtech/spatial4j/commit/c47575bf4d58dffa79ad4d03de261206ade83f2f\"><code>c47575b</code></a> Add default impl for Lon-Lat to X-Y</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/locationtech/spatial4j/commit/4d8d4a0f0d9662df0ecd20c70b8a9f0732e8c1eb\"><code>4d8d4a0</code></a> Require Java 8 (1.8)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/locationtech/spatial4j/commit/052cd128f3f14bb052ea08d2225b59a5bb7ffff8\"><code>052cd12</code></a> devnotes.md: update URLs</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/locationtech/spatial4j/commit/8af29680073cb175f41992e98ce7beaedc811786\"><code>8af2968</code></a> CONTRIBUTING: CLA -&gt; ECA</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/locationtech/spatial4j/commit/847b5396e14356c67abb4820cbf985b6867b1306\"><code>847b539</code></a> pom.xml update metadata &amp; build plugins (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/locationtech/spatial4j/issues/196\">#196</a>)</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/locationtech/spatial4j/compare/spatial4j-0.7...v0.8\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=org.locationtech.spatial4j:spatial4j&package-manager=maven&previous-version=0.7&new-version=0.8)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/configuring-github-dependabot-security-updates)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

fixes the problems with \"file:\".\r\n\r\nBefore passing to the OS, this has always been stripped and converted to an OS file name. There are other uses of filename handling code from Apache Commons IO, one of which `RDFLangauages.filenameToLang`, which takes a resource name (URI of filename) and uses the extension to guess the RDF syntax. It is used for file names and also URIs when there isn't content negotiation.\r\n\r\nThe fix, in IO.java, around line 100  (the rest of the PR is naming and cosmetic changes), is to extract the code from Apache Commons IO , remove the check for \":\" as a trailing component of the filename ([NTFS ADS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTFS#Alternate_data_streams_(ADS))) - windows uses \":\" in two places, drive and ADS. This clashes with the use of URI scheme name, which also uses \":\".\r\n\r\nThe fix is the safest approach - copying and restoring the old behaviour in a low risk fashion. Further factoring can be done after the 3.17.0 release to be tidier.","created_at":"2020-11-25T10:43:55Z","updated_at":"2020-11-25T11:07:18Z","closed_at":"2020-11-25T11:07:14Z","merged_at":"2020-11-25T11:07:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"a33b86878e9bba4b06ea14feb251d593aa0821d7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/pulls/871/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/pulls/871/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/871/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/statuses/c8c91f8b2e1c4b54e004b55f2cf50f8feb8b4b90","head":{"label":"apache:windows-file","ref":"windows-file","sha":"c8c91f8b2e1c4b54e004b55f2cf50f8feb8b4b90","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":7437073,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NDM3MDcz","name":"jena","full_name":"apache/jena","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/jena","description":"Apache

accepts</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.7.2</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Bug Fixes\n<ul>\n<li><code>@AllowedEnumValues</code> incorrectly provides help hint that values are case insensitive when they are actually case sensitive (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/rvesse/airline/issues/100\">#100</a>)</li>\n<li><code>@AllowedRawValues</code> does not handle case insensitive mode correctly (<a

2.13.2 from 2.13.0 (thanks to sullis for pull request)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Upgraded Kotlin extension to use Kotlin 1.3.72 (instead of 1.3.61)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improved org.awaitility.core.ConditionEvaluationLogger to accept a consumer that decides how the logs are printed. You can use this to for example log intermediary values using slf4j instead of System.out.println or log to to disk or a data structure such as CopyOnWriteArrayList. For example:</p>\n<p>await().conditionEvaluationListener(new ConditionEvaluationLogger(log::info)).until(<!-- raw HTML omitted -->);</p>\n<p>This will log using a the logger &quot;log&quot; instead of printing to the console.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fixed problems with test dependencies in pom.xml</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Upgraded Groovy from 2.5.7 to 3.0.4</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Changelog 4.0.2 (2020-01-03)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Improved formatting of elapsed time (or error and logging) for long time durations</li>\n<li>Implemented support for &quot;during&quot; (issue 124) (big thanks to Pablo Díaz-López for pull request)</li>\n<li>org.awaitility.core.ConditionEvaluationListener now has two additional hooks, &quot;beforeEvaluation&quot; and &quot;onTimeout&quot;, which you can implement to get notified on these events. They are implemented as default methods to retain backward compatibility. (issue 149) (big thanks to Oliver Grof for pull request)</li>\n<li>Upgraded Kotlin extension to use Kotlin 1.3.61 (instead of 1.3.50)</li>\n<li>Added &quot;handleIgnoredException&quot; to org.awaitility.core.ConditionEvaluationListener. This is a hook that let's you react to ignored exceptions caught when evaluating a condition (thanks to Oliver Grof for pull request)</li>\n<li>Avoid hiding exceptions on the same thread (issue 152) (thanks to Oliver Grof for pull request)</li>\n<li>Fixed condition timeout calculation units (issue 148) (thanks to Anthony Baker for pull request)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Changelog 4.0.1 (2019-09-06)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Removed the dependency to objenesis since it's no longer required after the move to Java 8+</li>\n<li>Fixed so that calculation of condition evaluation duration cannot be negative (thanks to Anders Asplund for pull request)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Changelog 4.0.0 (2019-08-30)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Added support for Adder's. For example: await().untilAdder(myLongAdder, equalTo(5L))</li>\n<li>Added support for Accumulators's. For example: await().untilAccumulator(myLongAccumulator, equalTo(5L))</li>\n<li>Better handling of InterruptedException for Future's by using code from Guava (code from Uninterruptibles)</li>\n<li>Shutting down cleanup ExecutorService in an uninterruptible fashion</li>\n<li>Upgraded Kotlin extension to use Kotlin 1.3.50 (instead of 1.3.41)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Changelog 4.0.0-rc1 (2019-07-15)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Upgraded Kotlin extension to use Kotlin 1.3.41 (instead of 1.3.11)</li>\n<li>Better handling of InterruptedException using code from Guava (Uninterruptibles#sleepUninterruptibly) (issue 134)</li>\n<li>Added org.awaitility.core.ConditionEvaluationLogger#conditionEvaluationLogger() methods. This is only useful for syntactic sugar to avoid having to write the &quot;new&quot; keyword in Java when using a ConditionEvaluationLogger. For example:\nawait().with().conditionEvaluationListener(conditionEvaluationLogger()). ..</li>\n<li>Awaitility now requires Java 8+ (i.e. support for Java 6 and Java 7 is dropped).</li>\n<li>Hamcrest is update from version 1.3 to 2.1.</li>\n<li>Awaitility now requires Java 8</li>\n<li>Scala version is updated from 2.11.8 to 2.13.0</li>\n<li>Upgraded Groovy from 2.4.11 to 2.5.7</li>\n<li>Removed the awaitility-proxy module since it's no longer required when using Java 8+.</li>\n<li>Removed the org.awaitility.core.Predicate interface, use java.util.function.Predicate instead.</li>\n<li>Removed the org.awaitility.core.BiFunction interface, use java.util.function.BiFunction instead.</li>\n<li>Removed the org.awaitility.core.Supplier interface, use java.util.function.Supplier instead.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

href=\"https://groups.google.com/d/msg/guava-announce/zHZTFg7YF3o/rQNnwdHeEwAJ\">Guava types can no longer be sent over GWT-RPC.</a> Even the earlier, temporary way to reenable support (<code>guava.gwt.emergency_reenable_rpc</code>) no longer has an effect. (0cb89dd110)</li>\n<li><code>cache</code>: Fixed memory leak in <code>LocalCache</code> under <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/j2objc\">j2objc</a>. (5e519d91d0)</li>\n<li><code>collect</code>: Added two-element <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> methods to <code>Comparators</code>. (958186c071)</li>\n<li><code>collect</code>: Removed <code>@Beta</code> from <code>Multimaps.toMultimap</code>. (b6b4dc49b1)</li>\n<li><code>collect</code>: Made the set returned by <code>ImmutableMap&lt;K, V&gt;.keySet()</code> serializable as long as <code>K</code> is serializable, even if <code>V</code> is not (and similarly for <code>values()</code>). (f5a69c33fc)</li>\n<li><code>collect</code>: Fixed bug in <code>powerSet.equals(otherPowerSet)</code> would erroneously return <code>false</code> if the two power sets' underlying sets were equal but had a different iteration order. (215b1f0dd7)</li>\n<li><code>collect</code>: Eliminated <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/j2objc\">j2objc</a> retain-cycle in <code>SingletonImmutableBiMap</code>. (0ad38b88bd)</li>\n<li><code>eventbus</code>: Prevented <code>@Subscribe</code> from being applied to a method that takes a primitive, as that will never be called. (554546c971)</li>\n<li><code>graph</code>: Made <code>Traverser.breadthFirst()</code> lazier, and optimized <code>Traverser</code> more generally. (32f2d770f7, b5210ca95c)</li>\n<li><code>graph</code>: Added <code>@DoNotMock</code> to <code>Traverser</code>. (6410f18c06)</li>\n<li><code>io</code>: Deprecated <code>Files.createTempDir()</code>. (fec0dbc463) (CVE forthcoming)</li>\n<li><del><code>io</code>: Upgraded <code>ByteStreams.copy(InputStream, OutputStream)</code> to use the faster <code>FileChannel</code> if possible. (a1e9a0bd12)</del> [update: My mistake: This was <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/commit/e839f94fb4eb1240f10763586aa92a7f701caa89\">rolled back</a>, so it did not make 30.0.]</li>\n<li><code>math</code>: Added <code>roundToDouble</code> to <code>BigDecimalMath</code>, <code>BigIntegerMath</code>, and <code>LongMath</code>. (bee4f3c7ed, 2b5c096ddf, 633abf2c62)</li>\n<li><code>net</code>: Added <code>MediaType</code> constants for several font/ types. (571cf66bac)</li>\n<li><code>net</code>: Added <code>HttpHeaders</code> constants for <code>Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy(-Report-Only)?</code>. (c3bf73187a)</li>\n<li><code>testing</code>: Made <code>EqualsTester</code> test that non-<code>String</code> objects are not equal to their <code>String</code> representations. (c9570eae69)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Added <code>ClosingFuture</code>. (52e048ed6c)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Removed the deprecated 1-arg <code>ServiceManager.addListener(Listener)</code>. Use the 2-arg <code>addListener(Listener, Executor)</code> overload, setting the executor to <code>directExecutor()</code> for equivalent behavior. (dfb0001714)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Changed <code>AbstractFuture.toString()</code> to no longer include the <code>toString()</code> of the result. (2ebf27fd45)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Added <code>awaitTerminationUninterruptibly</code>.
