href=\"https://github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently/releases\">concurrently's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v9.0.0</h2>\n<h1>💥 Breaking Changes</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Dropped support for Node.js &lt; 18.0.0</strong>.\nOlder Node.js version have reached end-of-life, and certain features require new-ish JS APIs.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The <code>concurrently</code> and default exports are now the same</strong> - <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently/issues/399\">#399</a>\nIt's reasonable to expect that <code>import { concurrently } from 'concurrently'</code> would work the same as <code>import concurrently from 'concurrently'</code>, however this has not been the case.\nThe former used to be an unconfigured version of concurrently, lacking all features that you'd get from the CLI, which was seen as a &quot;footgun&quot;. Both are now the same function.</p>\n<p>If you'd like to access the unconfigured function, use <code>import { createConcurrently } from 'concurrently'</code> instead.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>✨ New Features</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Exponential back-off support for process restarting - <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently/issues/265\">#265</a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently/issues/462\">#462</a>\nUse <code>--restart-after exponential</code>. Restarts happen at <code>2^N</code> seconds.</li>\n<li>Add prefix padding via new <code>--pad-prefix</code> flag - <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently/issues/166\">#166</a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently/issues/417\">#417</a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently/issues/495\">#495</a></li>\n<li>Specify teardown commands via new <code>--teardown</code> flag - <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently/issues/472\">#472</a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently/issues/500\">#500</a></li>\n<li>Expand <code>node:&lt;script&gt;</code> commands to <code>node --run &lt;script&gt;</code> - <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently/issues/475\">#475</a></li>\n<li><em>[API only]</em> Inter-Process Communication (ipc) - <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently/issues/498\">#498</a></li>\n<li><em>[API only]</em> Make it possible to use no colors at all - <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently/issues/466\">#466</a></li>\n<li><em>[API only]</em> Add a <code>state</code> field to <code>Command</code> - <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently/issues/455\">#455</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h1>🐛 Bug Fixes</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix importing concurrently in ESM package -

<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently/issues/463\">#463</a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently/issues/464\">#464</a></li>\n<li>Abort commands not running when max processes &lt; N - <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently/issues/433\">#433</a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently/issues/452\">#452</a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently/issues/460\">#460</a></li>\n<li>Fix warning coming from <code>spawn-command</code> when running in Node 22 - <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently/issues/407\">#407</a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently/issues/477\">#477</a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently/issues/479\">#479</a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently/issues/492\">#492</a></li>\n<li>Make <code>--raw</code> and <code>--hide</code> compatible -

It is a Javadoc-on-steroids focusing on Log4j plugins. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/issues/1954\">#1954</a>)</li>\n<li>Automate website deployment using the new CI infrastructure shipped with <code>org.apache.logging:logging-parent:11.0.0</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>=== Changed</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix usage of <code>log4j-api</code> in GraalVM without additional reachability data.

releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Dart Sass 1.78.0</h2>\n<p>To install Sass 1.78.0, download one of the packages below and <a href=\"https://katiek2.github.io/path-doc/\">add it to your PATH</a>, or see <a href=\"https://sass-lang.com/install\">the Sass website</a> for full installation instructions.</p>\n<h1>Changes</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The <code>meta.feature-exists</code> function is now deprecated. This deprecation is named <code>feature-exists</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fix a crash when using <code>@at-root</code> without any queries or children in the indented syntax.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>JS API</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Backport the deprecation options (<code>fatalDeprecations</code>, <code>futureDeprecations</code>, and <code>silenceDeprecations</code>) to the legacy JS API. The legacy JS API is itself deprecated, and you should move off of it if possible, but this will allow users of bundlers and other tools that are still using the legacy API to still control deprecation warnings.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fix a bug where accessing <code>SourceSpan.url</code> would crash when a relative URL was passed to the Sass API.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Embedded Sass</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Explicitly expose a <code>sass</code> executable from the <code>sass-embedded</code> npm package. This was intended to be included in 1.63.0, but due to the way platform-specific dependency executables are installed it did not work as intended.

The legacy JS API is itself\ndeprecated, and you should move off of it if possible, but this will allow\nusers of bundlers and other tools that are still using the legacy API to\nstill control deprecation warnings.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fix a bug where accessing <code>SourceSpan.url</code> would crash when a relative URL was\npassed to the Sass API.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Embedded Sass</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Explicitly expose a <code>sass</code> executable from the <code>sass-embedded</code> npm package.\nThis was intended to be included in 1.63.0, but due to the way\nplatform-specific dependency executables are installed it did not work as\nintended. Now users can run <code>npx sass</code> for local installs or just <code>sass</code> when\n<code>sass-embedded</code> is installed globally.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Add linux-riscv64, linux-musl-riscv64, and android-riscv64 support for the\n<code>sass-embedded</code> npm package.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fix an edge case where the Dart VM could hang when shutting down when requests\nwere in flight.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fix a race condition where the embedded host could fail to shut down if it was\nclosed around the same time a new compilation was started.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fix a bug where parse-time deprecation warnings could not be controlled by\nthe deprecation options in some circumstances.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/sass/dart-sass/commit/90a70ef168fa79a807d31386fb9aea037be1a284\"><code>90a70ef</code></a> Fix failing double check test for sass-parser (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/sass/dart-sass/issues/2330\">#2330</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/sass/dart-sass/commit/b1d5f987d9ea4dbc12c8e852fdc080db8b505bae\"><code>b1d5f98</code></a> Backport deprecation API to legacy JS API (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/sass/dart-sass/issues/2293\">#2293</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/sass/dart-sass/commit/56a42371e094a75c46e5337934bbcbc34336ca7f\"><code>56a4237</code></a> Delete unreachable <code>default</code> clause.

latest axios with a unix socket URL</h1>\n<p>As part of the axios update, the syntax for using a socket with an http URL in axios has changed so you must specify the protocol and server</p>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<p><code>http://unix:SOCKETPATH:http://server/foo/bar</code></p>\n<p>instead of just using only the path (no protocol and no server)</p>\n<p><code>http://unix:SOCKETPATH:/foo/bar</code></p>\n<p>Due to this change, I have updated my tests, docs, bumped the major version.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a

issue resolved #2346\r\n\r\nPull request Description:\r\n\r\nHi,\r\n\r\nMy old old thinkpad finally started to have some issues, so I'm setting up a new laptop, and thought it'd be good to clean up some older UI issues like this one.\r\n\r\nI installed Node LTS (20) with nvm, then enabled corepack (to get yarn), and did a yarn install. Very first project I am building on this new framework laptop. Did not get the yarn test:unit tests (I think someone updated vite and now the issue is gone :pray:).\r\n\r\n![Screenshot_2024-08-03_16-27-38](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ae6530a-a3e2-445e-88b6-80d653f1469f)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe warning was fixed automatically by yarn install, so I just committed it.\r\n\r\nIt also fixed the spaces around the colon for the windows script command.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n - [ ] Tests are included.\r\n - [ ] Documentation change and updates are
