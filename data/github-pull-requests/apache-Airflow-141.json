up of https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/24249.\r\n\r\nEnforcing log parsing to add:\r\n- Local datetime for the logs\r\n- Filter on the log level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, etc.)\r\n- Filter on the log group (python logger that emitted the log).\r\n\r\nThe parsing function is quite light at the moment, I still decided to memoized the results as I assume this could become quite expensive if the user requests the log `full_content`.\r\n\r\nI also moved moment initialization for tests from testUtils to jest-setup.js. (Sometimes tests don't need a  wrapper, and we still have to import testUtils module to get moment defined)\r\n\r\nTested with mapped tasks and task group. ✔️ \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14861206/173245600-9a9adb14-46c9-4c48-9b13-fa1d886bde53.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14861206/173245738-f3b7ca6f-8d51-419f-8bf2-9bb34f7c4d24.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

This PR is the\r\nattempt to migrate FAB to newer version.\r\n\r\nThis includes:\r\n\r\n* update setup.py and setup.cfg upper and lower bounds to\r\n  account for proper version of dependencies that\r\n  FAB < 4.0.0 was blocking from upgrade\r\n* added typed Flask application retrieval with a custom\r\n  application fields available for MyPy typing checks.\r\n* fix typing to account for typing hints added in multiple\r\n  upgraded libraries optional values and content of request\r\n  returned as Mapping\r\n* switch to PyJWT 2.* by using non-deprecated \"required\" claim as\r\n  list rather than separate fields\r\n* add possibiliyt to install providers without constraints\r\n  so that we could avoid errors on conflicting constraints when\r\n  upgrade-to-newer-dependencies is used\r\n* add pre-commit to check that 2.4+ only get_airflow_app is not\r\n  used in providers\r\n* avoid Bad Request in case the request sent to Flask 2.0 is not\r\n  JSon content type\r\n* switch imports of internal classes to direct packages\r\n  where classes are available rather than from \"airflow.models\" to\r\n  satisfy MyPY\r\n* synchronize changes of FAB Security Manager 4.1.1 with our copy\r\n  of the Security Manager.\r\n* add error handling for a few \"None\" cases detected by MyPY\r\n* corrected test cases that were broken by immutability of\r\n  Flask 2 objects and better escaping done by Flask 2\r\n* updated test cases to account for redirection to \"path\" rather\r\n  than full URL by Flask2\r\n\r\nFixes: https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/22397\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

DebugExecutor previously executed tasks by calling the \"private\" ti._run_raw_task(...) method instead of ti.run(...). But the latter contains the logic to increase task instance try_numbers when running, thus tasks executed with the DebugExecutor were never getting their try_numbers increased. For rescheduled tasks this led to off-by-one errors (as the logic to reduce the try_number for the reschedule was still working while the increase was not).\r\n\r\nThis off-by-one error manifests as a KeyError in _update_counters (seen in #13322) since the try_number for ti.keys in the in-memory ti_status.running map don't match the try_number in the ti.keys in the DB.  #13322 was marked as resolved because there were two issues being conflated, one issues was fixed (and the ticket closed) but users were still seeing this failure due to the issue fixed in this PR.\r\n\r\nThis unblocks system tests (which are executed with the DebugExecutor) which will hit the aforementioned off-by-one error if a system test includes a Sensor (which does more than one poke, it needs to be rescheduled at least once to raise the exception).\r\n\r\n**NOTE: The main fix here is to use ti.run() for the debug executor, if anyone has the historical context for that design decision please weigh in, thanks!** (CC @turbaszek)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

approach to add dict content metadata for `expand_kwargs(xcom_arg)`. First step toward https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/24021.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nCopying https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/24101#issuecomment-1149537574\r\n\r\nWhen we do\r\n\r\n```python\r\nxcom_arg  # Say this is {\"a\": [1, 2], \"b\": [3, 4, 5], \"c\": [6, 7]}\r\nfoo.expand_kwargs(xcom_arg)\r\n```\r\n\r\nwe can only expand the task to either 2 or 3 instances (depending whether we implement the `zip` or `zip_longest` semantic). We don’t actually need three additional entries storing the length of each value, but only need to record the zipped value is 2 (or 3—I think we should store both values). This means we only need to add two additional column on TaskMap (without changing the primary key), `zip=2` and `zig_longest=3`.

Technically they're the same library, it was just renamed recently.\r\n\r\nOne massive difference between the two versions is that oracledb no longer requires the user to have Oracle Client libraries installed on their machine, the library can connect directly to the server in thin client mode.

changes make the endpoint go from almost 20s down to 1.5s and the\nchanges are two fold:\n\n1. Keep datetimes as objects for as long as possible\n\n   Previously we were converting start/end dates for a task group to a\n   string, and then in the parent parsing it back to a datetime to find\n   the min and max of all the child nodes.\n\n   The fix for that was to leave it as a datetime (or a\n   pendulum.DateTime technically) and use the existing\n   `AirflowJsonEncoder` class to \"correctly\" encode these objects on\n   output.\n\n2. Reduce the number of DB queries from 1 per task to 1.\n\n   The removed `get_task_summaries` function was called for each task,\n   and was making a query to the database to find info for the given\n   DagRuns.\n\n   The helper function now makes just a single DB query for all\n   tasks/runs and constructs a dict to efficiently look up the ti by\n
