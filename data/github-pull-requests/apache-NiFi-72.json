Expected edges are not created\r\nbecause PlaceholderProvenanceEvent returns 'UNKNOWN'\r\nevent type, edge population logics relying on that type do not work.\r\n\r\nThis PR modifies existing provenance repository implementations to accept 'null' NiFi user so that NiFi internal component can query lineage without NiFi user and authorization.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

original PR #2470 had an unhandled situation wherein the components that don't have any `PropertyDescriptor` marked as `dynamicallyModifiesClasspath(true)` won't have the `additionalResourcesFingerprint` set i.e. it will be null so the framework will attempt to reload the resources. This caused an unexpected scenario especially when using Schema Registry services which @bbende explained in the [Release Apache NiFi 1.6.0 Dev thread](http://apache-nifi-developer-list.39713.n7.nabble.com/VOTE-Release-Apache-NiFi-1-6-0-td18236.html#a18259) \r\n\r\nI have tested both the scenarios:\r\n\r\n1.

For reviewer(s)\r\n\r\nPlease be aware that there is another major issue with 'complete path' strategy, that is #2542. It should be easier to confirm this fix if that PR is cherry-picked as well when you review this PR (in case if that one is not merged yet to master branch when you review this one).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBefore this fix, if provenance lineage is qualied by a user who does\r\nnot have 'view the data' plivilege for a component which emits\r\nprovenance events those create new FlowFile, then lineage computation stops\r\nat such component, instead of connecting other available events with\r\nthe created FlowFile lineage node. Expected edges are not created\r\nbecause PlaceholderProvenanceEvent returns 'UNKNOWN'\r\nevent type, edge population logics relying on that type do not work.\r\n\r\nThis commit modifies PlaceholderProvenanceEvent so that it can return\r\noriginal event type if necessary, as well as children and parent event uuids.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Does your PR title start with NIFI-XXXX where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically master)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit?\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install at the root nifi folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the LICENSE file, including the main LICENSE file under nifi-assembly?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the NOTICE file, including the main NOTICE file found under nifi-assembly?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added .displayName in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check travis-ci for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

PR is an update of the previous one (#2430) that has been reverted to fix a dependency issue.\r\n\r\nI've manually added a JSON Record reader in the abstract class using the code of the existing reader. For now, it's only used by the Metrics reporting task, but I plan to use the same approach for the other S2S reporting tasks.\r\n\r\n**Do not merge this PR as-is**.\r\n\r\nI currently see two issues:\r\n- the one already reported by @mattyb149: the record writer is not showing the reporting task in the \"referencing components\". I think it's probably a framework issue that could be solved in a separate JIRA. Will try to have a look later.\r\n- more importantly, I see an issue when using a writer with an access schema strategy using the Avro Schema registry CS. In that case, I get a Schema not found exception \"Failed to write metrics using record writer: Unable to find schema with name 'metrics'\". Not sure what is causing it, will have a look asap. If using \"inherit record schema\" strategy, it works as expected.\r\n\r\nWanted to open this PR, to have feedbacks on the approach regarding the JSON record reader.","created_at":"2018-03-21T21:30:23Z","updated_at":"2018-04-11T19:01:51Z","closed_at":"2018-04-11T19:01:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1dd2f39e2572b89213627bddd7a1052a7536bd3e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/2575/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/2575/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2575/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/statuses/b50ef824fbfd97b394679c363393a27786a5ad01","head":{"label":"pvillard31:NIFI-4809","ref":"NIFI-4809","sha":"b50ef824fbfd97b394679c363393a27786a5ad01","user":{"login":"pvillard31","id":11541012,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTQxMDEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11541012?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31","html_url":"https://github.com/pvillard31","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":51175123,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MTE3NTEyMw==","name":"nifi","full_name":"pvillard31/nifi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"pvillard31","id":11541012,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTQxMDEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11541012?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31","html_url":"https://github.com/pvillard31","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/pvillard31/nifi","description":"Mirror

For reviewer(s)\r\n\r\nPlease be aware that there is another major issue with 'complete path' strategy, that is #2542. It should be easier to confirm this fix if that PR is cherry-picked as well when you review this PR (in case if that one is not merged yet to master branch when you review this one).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAn existing NiFi user id who has sufficient privilege needs to be used\r\nin order to query full lineage information for 'complete path' strategy\r\nto work as expected.\r\n\r\nAdded new reporting task property so that user can specify such user id.\r\n\r\nAlso added exception handling logic to inform users that a proper user\r\nid is required.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Does your PR title start with NIFI-XXXX where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically master)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit?\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install at the root nifi folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the LICENSE file, including the main LICENSE file under nifi-assembly?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the NOTICE file, including the main NOTICE file found under nifi-assembly?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added .displayName in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check travis-ci for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

PR adds optional \"Schema Branch\" and \"Schema Version\" properties to the readers/writers which can be used when using the \"Schema Name\" access strategy. \r\n\r\nYou can specify schema name + branch, or schema name + version, and this will be passed down to the schema registry implementations. Currently only the Hortonworks Schema Registry makes use of the branch concept.\r\n\r\nThis PR also includes some refactoring to clean up the SchemaRegistry interface and move towards a single method to retrieve a schema that takes a schema identifier. Also added unit tests for all of the access strategies and access
