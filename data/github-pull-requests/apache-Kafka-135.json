we skip the steps to make a replica a follower if the leader does not change, inlcuding truncating the follower log if necessary. This can cause problems if the follower has missed one or more leader updates. Change the logic to only skip the steps if the new epoch is the same or one greater than the old epoch. Tested with unit tests that verify the behavior of Partition.scala and that show log truncation when the follower's log is ahead of the leader's, the follower has missed an epoch update, and the follower receives a LeaderAndIsrRequest making it a follower\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and

Refactor the StreamThread main loop, in the following:\r\n\r\n* Fetch from consumer and enqueue data to tasks.\r\n* Check if any tasks should be enforced process.\r\n* Loop over processable tasks and process them for N iterations, and then check for 1) commit, 2) punctuate, 3) need to call consumer.poll\r\n* Even if there is not data to process in this iteration, still need to check if commit / punctuate is needed\r\n* Finally, try update standby tasks.\r\n\r\n2. Add an optimization to only commit when it is needed (i.e. at least some process() or punctuate() was triggered since last commit).\r\n\r\n3.

client from version 3.4.13 doesn't handle connections to `localhost` very well. If ZooKeeper is started on 127.0.0.1 on a machine that has both ipv4 and ipv6 and a client is created using `localhost` rather than the IP address in the connection string, ZooKeeper client attempts to connect to ipv4 or ipv6 randomly with a fixed one second backoff if connection fails. Use `127.0.0.1` instead of `localhost` in streams tests to avoid intermittent test failures due to ZK client connection timeouts if ipv6 is chosen in consecutive address selections.

has always been an issue, but the recent upgrade to ZooKeeper\r\n3.4.13 means that it is also an issue when an unresolvable ZK\r\naddress is used, causing some tests to leak threads.\r\n\r\nThe change in behaviour in ZK 3.4.13 is that no exception is thrown\r\nfrom the ZooKeeper constructor in case of an unresolvable address.\r\nInstead, ZooKeeper tries to re-resolve the address hoping it becomes\r\nresolvable again. We eventually throw a\r\n`ZooKeeperClientTimeoutException`, which is similar to the case\r\nwhere the the address is resolvable, but ZooKeeper is not\r\nreachable.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist

In each iteration, decide if a task is processable if all of its partitions contains data, so it can decide which record to process next.\r\n\r\n1.a Add one exception that, if the task indeed have data on some but not all of its partitions, we only consider as not processable for some finite round of iterations.\r\n\r\n1.b Add a task-level metric to record whenever we are forced to process a task that is only \"partially data available\", since it may leads to non-determinism.\r\n\r\n2. Break the main loop on put-raw-data and process-them. Since now not all data put into the queue would be processed completely within a single iteration.\r\n\r\nNOTE that within an iteration, if a task has exhausted one of its queue it will still be processed, since we only update `processable` list once in each iteration, I'm improving on this on the follow-up part III PR.\r\n\r\n3. Found and fixed a bug in metrics recording: the taskName and sensorName parameters were exchanged.\r\n\r\n4. Optimized task stream time computation again since our current partition stream time reasoning has been simplified.\r\n\r\n5. Added unit tests.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify

format of the SASL/OAUTHBEARER client response is defined in\r\nRFC 7628 Section 3.1 as follows:\r\n\r\n     kvsep          = %x01\r\n     key            = 1*(ALPHA)\r\n     value          = *(VCHAR /

SASL/OAUTHBEARER client response as currently implemented in\r\nOAuthBearerSaslClient sends the valid gs2-header \"n,,\" but then\r\nsends the \"auth\" key and value immediately after it, like this:\r\n\r\nString.format(\"n,,auth=Bearer %s\", callback.token().value())\r\n\r\nThis does not conform to the specification because there is no\r\n%x01 after the gs2-header, no %x01 after the auth value, and no\r\nterminating %x01. The code should instead be as follows:\r\n\r\nString.format(\"n,,\\^Aauth=Bearer %s\\^A\\^A\",\r\ncallback.token().value())\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the parsing of the client response in\r\nOAuthBearerSaslServer, which currently allows the malformed text,\r\nmust also change.\r\n\r\nThis should be fixed prior to the initial release of the\r\nSASL/OAUTHBEARER code in 2.0.0 to prevent compatibility problems.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Ron Dagostino <rndgstn@gmail.com>\r\n\r\n*More detailed description of your change,\r\nif necessary.

The last remarkable message we found in our logs was [this](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/1.0/core/src/main/scala/kafka/utils/ZkUtils.scala#L440) Exception, which contained [KafkaHealthcheck.register()](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/1.0/core/src/main/scala/kafka/server/KafkaHealthcheck.scala#L59) in its stack trace.\r\n\r\nIn our case, the ephemeral Zookeeper node for the broker that [handleNewSession](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/1.0/core/src/main/scala/kafka/server/KafkaHealthcheck.scala#L119) should create apparently still existed - Kafka restarted too quickly after it crashed before. The exception caused by the attempt to re-create this Zookeeper node eventually causes [ZkEventThread.run()](https://github.com/sgroschupf/zkclient/blob/0.9/src/main/java/org/I0Itec/zkclient/ZkEventThread.java#L63) to idle, since the Exception is caught there and merely logged. Since no further Events occur, the event thread apparently idles.\r\n\r\n### Solution and rationale\r\n\r\nIn order to have clean well-defined behavior in this case, we've decided that it would be best to finish the broker process in such a case. We've decided to `sys.exit(1)` and rely on the [shutdownHook](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/1.0/core/src/main/scala/kafka/Kafka.scala#L88) to do a proper shutdown.\r\n\r\nThis pull request contains the change described above. It should fix issue [KAFKA-4277](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-4277).\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ]

existing interface and javadoc on window store are confusing and slightly misleading about\r\nthe roles of the `windowSize` parameter to the store and the `timestamp` parameter of `WindowStore#put`.\r\n\r\n* clarify the parameters\r\n* deprecate `WindowStore#put()`. This variant is confusing. It's almost certainly not the right thing to use for anyone, since it still inserts the record at a timestamp, and it's (currently) undefined what the timestamp will be. In practice, this is always the record timestamp, which is again, unlikely to be correct for time window stores. If that is the intent, callers can easily supply the record timestamp themselves.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ]

is a subtask from KAFKA-6788 (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-6788)\r\n\r\nBasically the idea is to use thread-safe collections like ConcurrentLinkedQueue and ConcurrentHashMap to save to result of each \"findCoordinator\" response. In the map, we will have the coordinator node Id as the key, and the value will be the collection of all the belonging groupIds. \r\n\r\nWhen all the groupId processed (either successful or completed exceptionally), then we will iterate through the map and group the requests by coordinators.\r\n\r\nThis PR is mainly for discussion, there are a couple concerns:\r\n\r\n1. Code logic: Is there any thing wrong with the logic of this solution?\r\n2. Concurrency issues: can these collections guarantee the thread-safety?\r\n3. Memory issue: using too many collections to store information, should cut down the memory usage.\r\n4. Efficiency: is this more efficient than the implementation before (i.e. latency)?\r\n5. Naming issues.\r\n6. More unit tests.\r\n\r\nI am open to all kind of suggestions and feedbacks, and will make several other commits after I receive opinion. \r\n\r\nP.S.

PR modifies Throttler.scala by setting the `periodStartNs` to the current time instead of the time before the potential `sleep` call when throttling is needed. The reason behind is that if we reset `periodStartNs` to the time before `sleep`, we will increase the time window in the next actual rate calculation, which will underestimate the actual rate and may miss the throttling opportunity or sleep for less time. A unit test is also added to test the fix.\r\n\r\nFor example, if we use Throttler to throttle the pre sec rate to 10 with checkInterval 1s, in the original implementation:\r\n1. 15 events happen during [t0, t0+1s]\r\n2. Throttler will sleep the thread until t0+1.5s, then reset period start time to t0+1s\r\n3. 10 events happen during [t0+1.5s, t0+2s], Throttler will not throttle this time because the estimated rate is `10 / [(t0+2s) - (t0+1s)] = 10`\r\n\r\nBut the actual rate during [t0, t0+2s] is `(10+15) / 2 = 12.5 > 10`\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [x] Verify design and

need to use the same lock for metric update and read to avoid NPE and concurrent modification exceptions.  Sensor add/remove/update are synchronized on `Sensor` since they access lists and maps that are not thread-safe. Reporters are notified of metrics add/remove while holding (`Sensor`, `Metrics`) locks and reporters may synchronize on the reporter lock. Metric read may be invoked by metrics reporters while holding a reporter lock. So read/update cannot be synchronized using `Sensor` since that could lead to deadlock. This PR introduces a new lock in Sensor for update/read. \r\nLocking order:\r\n```\r\n- Sensor#add: Sensor -> Metrics -> MetricsReporter\r\n- Metrics#removeSensor: Sensor -> Metrics -> MetricsReporter\r\n- KafkaMetric#metricValue: MetricsReporter -> Sensor#metricLock\r\n- Sensor#record: Sensor -> Sensor#metricLock\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit
