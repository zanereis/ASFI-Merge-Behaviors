example code in mllib-collaborative-filtering.md using include_example https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-13014\n\nThe example code in the user guide is embedded in the markdown and hence it is not easy to test. It would be nice to automatically test them. This JIRA is to discuss options to automate example code testing and see what we can do in Spark 1.6.\n\nGoal is to move actual example code to spark/examples and test compilation in Jenkins builds. Then in the markdown, we can reference part of the code to show in the user guide. This requires adding a Jekyll tag that is similar to https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/blob/master/lib/jekyll/tags/include.rb, e.g., called include_example.\n`{% include_example scala/org/apache/spark/examples/mllib/RecommendationExample.scala %}`\nJekyll will find `examples/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/examples/mllib/RecommendationExample.scala` and pick code blocks marked \"example\" and replace code block in \n`{% highlight %}`\n in the markdown. \n\nSee more sub-tasks in parent ticket:

patch adds a new optimizer rule for performing limit pushdown. Limits will now be pushed down in two cases:\n- If a limit is on top of a `UNION ALL` operator, then a partition-local limit operator will be pushed to each of the union operator's children.\n- If a limit is on top of an `OUTER JOIN` then a partition-local limit will be pushed to one side of the join. For `LEFT OUTER` and `RIGHT OUTER` joins, the limit will be pushed to the left and right side, respectively. For `FULL OUTER` join, we will only push limits when at most one of the inputs is already limited: if one input is limited we will push a smaller limit on top of it and if neither input is limited then we will limit the input which is estimated to be larger.\n\nThese optimizations were proposed previously by @gatorsmile in #10451 and #10454, but those earlier PRs were closed and deferred for later because at that time Spark's physical `Limit` operator would trigger a full shuffle to perform global limits so there was a chance that pushdowns could actually harm performance by causing additional shuffles/stages. In #7334, we split the `Limit` operator into separate `LocalLimit` and `GlobalLimit` operators, so we can now push down only local limits (which don't require extra shuffles). This patch is based on both of @gatorsmile's patches, with changes and simplifications due to partition-local-limiting.\n\nWhen we push down the limit, we still keep the original limit in place, so we need a mechanism to ensure that the optimizer rule doesn't keep pattern-matching once the limit has been pushed down. In order to handle this, this patch adds a `maxRows` method to `SparkPlan` which returns the maximum number of rows that the plan can compute, then defines the pushdown rules to only push limits to children if the children's maxRows are greater than the limit's maxRows. This idea is carried over from #10451; see that patch for additional discussion.\n","created_at":"2016-02-08T21:19:05Z","updated_at":"2016-02-15T02:05:53Z","closed_at":"2016-02-15T01:33:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"164036ffc427b962dea4f9690d50a41efac1bf7a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11121/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11121/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11121/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/020fafeeda92d8da255c4ea3ee18570ffdb91189","head":{"label":"JoshRosen:limit-pushdown-2","ref":"limit-pushdown-2","sha":"020fafeeda92d8da255c4ea3ee18570ffdb91189","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22238710,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIzODcxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"JoshRosen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen/spark","description":"Mirror

the parser added two `Distinct` operators in the plan if we are using `Union` or `Union Distinct` in the SQL. This PR is to remove the extra `Distinct` from the plan. \n\nFor example, before the fix, the following query has a plan with two `Distinct`\n\n``` scala\nsql(\"select * from t0 union select * from t0\").explain(true)\n```\n\n```\n== Parsed Logical Plan ==\n'Project [unresolvedalias(*,None)]\n+- 'Subquery u_2\n   +- 'Distinct\n      +- 'Project [unresolvedalias(*,None)]\n         +- 'Subquery

example code in mllib-clustering.md using include_example\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-13013\n\nThe example code in the user guide is embedded in the markdown and hence it is not easy to test. It would be nice to automatically test them. This JIRA is to discuss options to automate example code testing and see what we can do in Spark 1.6.\n\nGoal is to move actual example code to spark/examples and test compilation in Jenkins builds. Then in the markdown, we can reference part of the code to show in the user guide. This requires adding a Jekyll tag that is similar to https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/blob/master/lib/jekyll/tags/include.rb, e.g., called include_example.\n`{% include_example scala/org/apache/spark/examples/mllib/KMeansExample.scala %}`\nJekyll will find `examples/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/examples/mllib/KMeansExample.scala` and pick code blocks marked \"example\" and replace code block in \n`{% highlight %}`\n in the markdown. \n\nSee more sub-tasks in parent ticket:

a private non-deprecated version of setRuns API so that we can call it from the PythonAPI without deprecation warnings in our own build.

Add a logWarning for non-1 values\n\nMFDataGenerator:\nApparently we are calling round on an integer which now in Scala 2.11 results in a warning (it didn't make any sense before either). Figure out if this is a mistake we can just remove or if we got the types wrong somewhere.\n\nI put these two together since they are both deprecation fixes in MLlib and pretty small, but I can split

example code in the user guide is embedded in the markdown and hence it is not easy to test. It would be nice to automatically test them. This JIRA is to discuss options to automate example code testing and see what we can do in Spark 1.6.\n\nGoal is to move actual example code to spark/examples and test compilation in Jenkins builds. Then in the markdown, we can reference part of the code to show in the user guide. This requires adding a Jekyll tag that is similar to https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/blob/master/lib/jekyll/tags/include.rb, e.g., called include_example.\n`{% include_example scala/org/apache/spark/examples/mllib/SummaryStatisticsExample.scala %}`\nJekyll will find `examples/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/examples/mllib/SummaryStatisticsExample.scala` and pick code blocks marked \"example\" and replace code block in \n`{% highlight %}`\n in the markdown. \n\nSee more sub-tasks in parent ticket:

is an initial PR illustrating one of the possible approaches for providing consistent accumulators for data properties in Spark.\r\n\r\nTasks executed on Spark workers are unable to modify values from the driver, and accumulators are the one exception for this. Accumulators in Spark are implemented in such a way that when a stage is recomputed (say for cache eviction) the accumulator will be updated a second time. This makes accumulators inside of transformations more difficult to use for things like counting invalid records (one of the primary potential use cases of collecting side information during a transformation). However in some cases this counting during re-evaluation is exactly the behaviour we want (say in tracking total execution time for a particular function). Spark would benefit from a version of accumulators which did not double count even if stages were re-executed.\r\n\r\nMotivating example:\r\n\r\n``` scala\r\nval parseTime = sc.longAccumulator()\r\nval parseFailures = sc.longAccumulator()\r\nval parsedData = sc.textFile(...).flatMap { line =>\r\n  val start = System.currentTimeMillis()\r\n  val parsed = Try(parse(line))\r\n  if (parsed.isFailure) parseFailures.add(1)\r\n  parseTime.add(System.currentTimeMillis() - start)\r\n  parsed.toOption\r\n}\r\nparsedData.cache()\r\n\r\nval resultA = parsedData.map(...).filter(...).count()\r\n\r\n// some intervening code.  Almost anything could happen here -- some of parsedData may\r\n// get kicked out of the cache, or an executor where data was cached might get lost\r\n\r\nval resultB = parsedData.filter(...).map(...).flatMap(...).count()\r\n\r\n// now we look at the accumulators\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere we would want parseFailures to only have been added to once for every line which failed to parse.  Unfortunately, the current Spark accumulator API doesn’t support the current parseFailures use case since if some data had been evicted its possible that it will be double counted.\r\n\r\nSee the full design document at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lR_l1g3zMVctZXrcVjFusq2iQVpr4XvRK_UUDsDr6nk/edit?usp=sharing\r\n\r\ncc @squito @andrewor14 who have provided feedback on earlier designs.\r\n\r\nThis PR is an updated version of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/10841 with a cleaner API and unified class structure. This is still a WIP / request for comments some of the open questions are:\r\n1) What do we call consistent accumulators? Data property accumulators? Something else?\r\n2) Right now they only work inside of MapPartitionRDDs (which covers the places where user code would want to put data property accumulators) - but do we want something like this for internal use and if so what situations do we want them in?\r\n3) Do we want to allow the user to retrieve the value per RDD for consistent accumulators?\r\n4) Do we want to expose a Java API right away as well?\r\n5) Right now the user facing API just allows users to create accumulators rather than general accumuables - do we want to offer both?\r\netc (with more questions/tradeoffs in the

patch adds the following changes:\n- Creates type specific subclasses of `pyspark.ml.param.Param` with specialized validation for each type. This mirrors the param subclasses in Scala.\n- Adds an optional parameter `isValid` to the `Param` constructor which is a function that maps a parameter value to a Boolean. (e.g. `lambda value: value >= 0`)\n- Adds `_validate` and `_convertAndValidate` functions to `Param` class which help with type conversions and validation when param values are set.\n- Adds a `ParamValidators` class for factory validation methods, mirroring Scala.\n- Changes all existing ml params to use the type specific subclasses.\n- Adds unit tests to verify that parameter type conversion occurs.\n\nI think this is the best way to provide robust type checking/conversion mechanisms in Python without resorting to a confusing public API and to support arbitrary future cases for params. Overall, this change aims to make the Python params more closely match the param implementations in Scala.\n\nI would be happy to split this PR if it makes it more manageable, though I think the changes are intertwined.\n\nFollow up work: \n- Change the Param copy method to call `_set` instead of changing the param map directly. [SPARK-12944](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-12944)\n- Change all param setters to use private `_set` function instead of changing param map directly.\n\ncc @yanboliang @holdenk @davies

a _SUCCESS appears in the inner partitioning dir, partition discovery will treat that _SUCCESS file as a data file. Then, partition discovery will fail because it finds that the dir structure is not valid. We should ignore those `_SUCCESS` files.\n\nIn future, it is better to ignore all files/dirs starting with `_` or `.`. This PR does not make this change. I am thinking about making this change simple, so we can consider of getting it in branch 1.6.\n\nTo ignore all files/dirs starting with `_` or `, the main change is to let ParquetRelation have another way to get metadata files. Right now, it relies on FileStatusCache's cachedLeafStatuses, which returns file statuses of both metadata files (e.g. metadata files used by parquet) and data files, which requires more

a few Spark SQL join operators broadcast one side of the join to all nodes. The are a few problems with this:\n- This conflates broadcasting (a data exchange) with joining. Data exchanges should be managed by a different operator.\n- All these nodes implement their own (duplicate) broadcasting logic.\n- Re-use of indices is quite hard.\n\nThis PR defines both a `BroadcastDistribution` and `BroadcastPartitioning`, these contain a `BroadcastMode`. The `BroadcastMode` defines the way in which we transform the Array of `InternalRow`'s into an index. We currently support the following `BroadcastMode`'s:\n- IdentityBroadcastMode: This broadcasts the rows in their original form.\n- HashSetBroadcastMode: This applies a projection to the input rows, deduplicates these rows and broadcasts the resulting `Set`.\n- HashedRelationBroadcastMode: This transforms the input rows into a `HashedRelation`, and broadcasts this index.\n\nTo match this distribution we implement a `BroadcastExchange` operator which will perform the broadcast for us, and have `EnsureRequirements` plan this operator. The old Exchange operator has been renamed into ShuffleExchange in order to clearly separate between Shuffled and Broadcasted exchanges. Finally the classes in Exchange.scala have been moved to a dedicated package.\n\ncc @rxin @davies

with Scala 2.11 results in the warning trait SynchronizedBuffer in package mutable is deprecated: Synchronization via traits is deprecated as it is inherently unreliable. Consider java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentLinkedQueue as an alternative - we already use ConcurrentLinkedQueue elsewhere so lets replace it.\n\nSome notes about how behaviour is different for reviewers:\nThe Seq from a SynchronizedBuffer that was implicitly converted would continue to receive updates - however when we do the same conversion explicitly on the ConcurrentLinkedQueue this isn't the case. Hence changing some of the (internal & test) APIs to pass an Iterable. toSeq is safe to use if there are no more

PR improve the performance for Broadcast join with dimension tables, which is common in data warehouse.\n\nIf the join key can fit in a long, we will use a special api `get(Long)` to get the rows from HashedRelation.\n\nIf the HashedRelation only have unique keys, we will use a special api `getValue(Long)` or `getValue(InternalRow)`.\n\nIf the keys can fit within a long, also the keys are dense, we will use a array of UnsafeRow, instead a hash map.\n\nTODO: will do

analysis rules generate aliases or auxiliary attribute references with the same name but different expression IDs. For example, `ResolveAggregateFunctions` introduces `havingCondition` and `aggOrder`, and `DistinctAggregationRewriter` introduces `gid`.\n\nThis is OK for normal query execution since these attribute references get expression IDs. However, it's troublesome when converting resolved query plans back to SQL query strings since expression IDs are erased.\n\nHere's an example Spark 1.6.0 snippet for illustration:\n\n``` scala\nsqlContext.range(10).select('id as 'a, 'id as 'b).registerTempTable(\"t\")\nsqlContext.sql(\"SELECT SUM(a) FROM t GROUP BY a, b ORDER BY COUNT(a), COUNT(b)\").explain(true)\n```\n\nThe above code produces the following resolved plan:\n\n```\n== Analyzed Logical Plan ==\n_c0: bigint\nProject [_c0#101L]\n+- Sort [aggOrder#102L ASC,aggOrder#103L ASC], true\n   +- Aggregate [a#47L,b#48L], [(sum(a#47L),mode=Complete,isDistinct=false) AS _c0#101L,(count(a#47L),mode=Complete,isDistinct=false) AS aggOrder#102L,(count(b#48L),mode=Complete,isDistinct=false) AS aggOrder#103L]\n      +- Subquery t\n         +- Project [id#46L AS a#47L,id#46L AS b#48L]\n            +- LogicalRDD [id#46L], MapPartitionsRDD[44] at range at <console>:26\n```\n\nHere we can see that both aggregate expressions in `ORDER BY` are extracted into an `Aggregate` operator, and both of them are named `aggOrder` with different expression IDs.\n\nThe solution is to automatically add the expression IDs into the attribute name for the Alias and AttributeReferences that are generated by Analyzer in SQL Generation. \n\nIn this PR, it also resolves another issue. Users could use the same name as the internally generated names. The duplicate names should not cause name ambiguity. When resolving the column, Catalyst should not pick the column that is internally generated. \n\nCould you review the solution? @marmbrus @liancheng \n\nI did not set the newly added flag for all the alias and attribute reference generated by Analyzers. Please let me know if I should do it? Thank you!

In Spark 2.0, we want to provide native implementations for DDLs for both SQLContext and HiveContext.\n\nThis PR will do the first step to parse DDL commands and create logical commands that encapsulate them. Actual implementations still delegate to HiveNativeCommand

for [SPARK-13002](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-13002) about the initial number of executors when running with dynamic allocation on Mesos.\nInstead of fixing it just for the Mesos case, made the change in `ExecutorAllocationManager`. It is already driving the number of executors running on Mesos, only no the initial value.\n\nThe `None` and `Some(0)` are internal details on the computation of resources to reserved, in the Mesos backend scheduler. `executorLimitOption` has to be initialized correctly, otherwise the Mesos backend scheduler will, either, create to many executors at launch, or not create any executors and not be able to recover from this state.\n\nRemoved the 'special case' description in the doc. It was not totally accurate, and is not needed anymore.\n\nThis doesn't fix the same problem visible with Spark standalone. There is no straightforward way to send the initial value in standalone mode.\n\nSomebody knowing this part of the yarn support should review this change.\n","created_at":"2016-02-03T10:02:46Z","updated_at":"2016-02-05T22:39:13Z","closed_at":"2016-02-05T22:39:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e65492148cdc7a864c61a557225a655c76c6a4ff","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11047/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11047/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11047/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f5ab629fde5bd5520e367473160b708c7e23c535","head":{"label":"skyluc:issue/initial-dyn-alloc-2","ref":"issue/initial-dyn-alloc-2","sha":"f5ab629fde5bd5520e367473160b708c7e23c535","user":{"login":"skyluc","id":1098830,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTg4MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1098830?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyluc","html_url":"https://github.com/skyluc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyluc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyluc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyluc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyluc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyluc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyluc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyluc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyluc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyluc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"82d84ff2dd3efb3bda20b529f09a4022586fb722","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

PR provides a workaround for [SPARK-13157](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-13157) to fix flaky Thrift server `ADD JAR` commands. The problem is that our Jenkins builds may be executed under a path containing `@` character while the `ADD JAR` command doesn't support this kind of path and simply drops the `@` character. The workaround provided here is to first copy the jar file to be added to a temporary path and then execute `ADD JAR` using this path.\n\nHere we also adds more logs to Thrift server test suites to ease future test failure debugging.\n","created_at":"2016-02-03T01:56:15Z","updated_at":"2016-02-05T01:08:11Z","closed_at":"2016-02-03T07:55:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"16b9e1b6a42ea1357f30a63ea5c601f0913f3b59","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11040/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11040/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11040/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b6b186f1597c7e8de94e8eaf9706b1e2fa226358","head":{"label":"liancheng:spark-13150-wip","ref":"spark-13150-wip","sha":"b6b186f1597c7e8de94e8eaf9706b1e2fa226358","user":{"login":"liancheng","id":230655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng","html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17232535,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzMjUzNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"liancheng/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"liancheng","id":230655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng","html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng/spark","description":"Mirror
