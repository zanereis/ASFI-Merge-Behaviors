Change Logs\r\n\r\nPR targeting master: #11302, #11342\r\nThis PR targets at `branch-0.x` with the same set of changes.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the flexibility to plug in custom `FileFormatUtils` implementation based on the `HoodieStorage` instance.  To realize this, two new APIs `#getFileFormatUtils` are added to the `HoodieIOFactory` so that the IO factory implementation class can customize the `FileFormatUtils` implementation to return.  The hardcoded logic in `FileFormatUtils#getInstance` for Hadoop-based implementation is moved to `HoodieHadoopIOFactory` class.  New tests are added in `TestHoodieHadoopIOFactory`.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nAllows pluggable `FileFormatUtils` implementation\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Documentation

Change Logs\r\n\r\nAbstractHoodieLogRecordReader#processNextRecord access modifier is wrong and should be changed from public to protected.\r\n\r\nreason:\r\nprocessNextRecord is used to process

Change Logs\r\n\r\nPR targeting master: https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/11256\r\nThis PR targets at `branch-0.x` with the same fix.\r\n\r\nWe occasionally this duplicate keys being ingested to RLI partition in MDT. Fixing the root cause in this patch. \r\n\r\nRoot cause:\r\nAfter fetching record locations from RLI partition in MDT, before doing snapshot read to honor payload merge and ordering field, we fetch unique Partition and fileId pairs. Instead of fetching unique pair of {Partition, fileId}s, we were using [HoodieRecordGlobalLocation](https://github.com/apache/hudi/blob/e4b56b090fdcb76416c60bd7ddd4247f0955c152/hudi-client/hudi-client-common/src/main/java/org/apache/hudi/index/HoodieIndexUtils.java#L298) which also contains \"instantTime\" in addition to partition path and fileId. So, this was resulting in 1 record from incoming resulting in 2 to 3 or N records after joining because of this. \r\n\r\nI have written tests to reproduce the issue. If not for the fix, we will encounter below exception \r\n```\r\n\r\nCaused by: org.apache.hudi.exception.HoodieAppendException: Failed while appending records to

Change Logs\r\n\r\nPR targeting master: https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/11301\r\nThis PR targets `branch-0.x` with the same changes.\r\n\r\nWhen running tests in Trino with Hudi metadata table (MDT) enabled, the `HoodieAvroHFileWriter` throws class cast exception, since Trino uses dependency injection to provide the Hadoop file system instance, which may skip the Hudi wrapper file system logic.  This PR adds new logic to gracefully cast file system instance in Avro writers to handle such cases.\r\n\r\n```\r\nCaused by: java.lang.ClassCastException: class io.trino.hdfs.TrinoFileSystemCache$FileSystemWrapper cannot be cast to class org.apache.hudi.hadoop.fs.HoodieWrapperFileSystem (io.trino.hdfs.TrinoFileSystemCache$FileSystemWrapper and org.apache.hudi.hadoop.fs.HoodieWrapperFileSystem are in unnamed module of loader 'app')\r\n    at org.apache.hudi.io.hadoop.HoodieAvroHFileWriter.<init>(HoodieAvroHFileWriter.java:91)\r\n    at org.apache.hudi.io.hadoop.HoodieAvroFileWriterFactory.newHFileFileWriter(HoodieAvroFileWriterFactory.java:108)\r\n    at org.apache.hudi.io.storage.HoodieFileWriterFactory.getFileWriterByFormat(HoodieFileWriterFactory.java:70)\r\n    at org.apache.hudi.io.storage.HoodieFileWriterFactory.getFileWriter(HoodieFileWriterFactory.java:53)\r\n    at org.apache.hudi.io.HoodieCreateHandle.<init>(HoodieCreateHandle.java:108)\r\n    at org.apache.hudi.io.HoodieCreateHandle.<init>(HoodieCreateHandle.java:77)\r\n    at org.apache.hudi.io.CreateHandleFactory.create(CreateHandleFactory.java:45)\r\n    at org.apache.hudi.execution.CopyOnWriteInsertHandler.consume(CopyOnWriteInsertHandler.java:101)\r\n    at org.apache.hudi.execution.CopyOnWriteInsertHandler.consume(CopyOnWriteInsertHandler.java:44)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nMakes Hudi MDT writing in Trino tests work.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nPR targeting master: #11266 #11309\r\nThis PR targets at `branch-0.x` with the same changes.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new API `#setStorage` to the `HoodieTableMetaClient` builder so the builder can take `HoodieStorage` instance directly to build the meta client.  The `HoodieTableMetaClient` can still be built through the storage configuration.  The instantiation of the meta client on the the read path in the `hudi-common` module has been replaced with the usage of `HoodieStorage` instance.\r\n\r\nNote that, since `HoodieStorage` instance is intended to be not serializable, `HoodieTableMetaClient` still holds the `storageConf` instance which is serializable, which can be sent from the Spark driver to the executor.  In that way, the meta client still has the `storageConf` after deserialization on the executor (sent from driver), and the `HoodieStorage` is instantiated first by leveraging the storage configuration, i.e., `getStorage()` instantiates `this.storage` if it is null.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nSimplifies Trino Hudi connector integration.\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n###

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the flexibility to plug in custom `FileFormatUtils` implementation based on the `HoodieStorage` instance.  To realize this, two new APIs `#getFileFormatUtils` are added to the `HoodieIOFactory` so that the IO factory implementation class can customize the `FileFormatUtils` implementation to return.  The hardcoded logic in `FileFormatUtils#getInstance` for Hadoop-based implementation is moved to `HoodieHadoopIOFactory` class.  New tests are added in `TestHoodieHadoopIOFactory`.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nAllows pluggable `FileFormatUtils` implementation\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Documentation

Change Logs\r\n\r\nWhen running tests in Trino with Hudi metadata table (MDT) enabled, the `HoodieAvroHFileWriter` throws class cast exception, since Trino uses dependency injection to provide the Hadoop file system instance, which may skip the Hudi wrapper file system logic.  This PR adds new logic to gracefully cast file system instance in Avro writers to handle such cases.\r\n\r\n```\r\nCaused by: java.lang.ClassCastException: class io.trino.hdfs.TrinoFileSystemCache$FileSystemWrapper cannot be cast to class org.apache.hudi.hadoop.fs.HoodieWrapperFileSystem (io.trino.hdfs.TrinoFileSystemCache$FileSystemWrapper and org.apache.hudi.hadoop.fs.HoodieWrapperFileSystem are in unnamed module of loader 'app')\r\n    at org.apache.hudi.io.hadoop.HoodieAvroHFileWriter.<init>(HoodieAvroHFileWriter.java:91)\r\n    at org.apache.hudi.io.hadoop.HoodieAvroFileWriterFactory.newHFileFileWriter(HoodieAvroFileWriterFactory.java:108)\r\n    at org.apache.hudi.io.storage.HoodieFileWriterFactory.getFileWriterByFormat(HoodieFileWriterFactory.java:70)\r\n    at org.apache.hudi.io.storage.HoodieFileWriterFactory.getFileWriter(HoodieFileWriterFactory.java:53)\r\n    at org.apache.hudi.io.HoodieCreateHandle.<init>(HoodieCreateHandle.java:108)\r\n    at org.apache.hudi.io.HoodieCreateHandle.<init>(HoodieCreateHandle.java:77)\r\n    at org.apache.hudi.io.CreateHandleFactory.create(CreateHandleFactory.java:45)\r\n    at org.apache.hudi.execution.CopyOnWriteInsertHandler.consume(CopyOnWriteInsertHandler.java:101)\r\n    at org.apache.hudi.execution.CopyOnWriteInsertHandler.consume(CopyOnWriteInsertHandler.java:44)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nMakes Hudi MDT writing in Trino tests work.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nPR targeting master: https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/11259\r\nThis PR targets at `branch-0.x` to adapt to 0.x releases.\r\n\r\nThis PR simplifies `HoodieStorage` instance fetching to pass down the `HoodieStorage` instance from the meta client as much as possible, instead of using reflection, which may not work with a given file system instance like `TrinoFileSystem` instance.\r\n\r\nThe major changes in this PR include:\r\n- Introduces a new config `hoodie.storage.class` for instantiation of `HoodieStorage` class in Spark engine only.\r\n- Makes `HoodieIOFactory` to instantiate with `HoodieStorage` instance and use the instance for creating readers and writers; makes `HoodieStorage` to store the `StorageConfiguration` instance and adds a new API `#newInstance` to `HoodieStorage`.\r\n- Removes usage of `HoodieStorageUtils.getStorage` on the read path in `hudi-common` and `hudi-io` modules. Before this PR, `HoodieStorage` instantiated through reflection with the path and storage configuration through `HoodieStorageUtils.getStorage` does not work with a provided file system instance like `TrinoFileSystem`.  With this PR, `HoodieStorage` instance is passed down from the meta client as much as possible.  For engines like Spark, we still have the reflection code for `HoodieHadoopStorage` to make it work on the executor side.\r\n- Refactors the code so that the `HoodieStorage` is passed down to the places it is needed.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nAs above.\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2024-05-24T23:01:03Z","updated_at":"2024-05-25T06:01:04Z","closed_at":"2024-05-25T06:01:03Z","merged_at":"2024-05-25T06:01:03Z","merge_commit_sha":"3b273d2a2f63d58451fcea4241856a341d8b768d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":5693784631,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBI7nWM8AAAABU2BCNw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/release-0.15.0","name":"release-0.15.0","color":"006b75","default":false,"description":""},{"id":6615577906,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBI7nWM8AAAABilG1Mg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/size:XL","name":"size:XL","color":"C50833","default":false,"description":"PR

Change Logs\r\n\r\n`BaseErrorTableWriter`, `HoodieStreamer`, `StreamSync`, and `StreamSyncService` are public API classes and contain public API methods which are frequently used and extended by users, which should be kept the same as before `HoodieStorage` abstraction changes.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new API `#setStorage` to the `HoodieTableMetaClient` builder so the builder can take `HoodieStorage` instance directly to build the meta client.  The `HoodieTableMetaClient` can still be built through the storage configuration.  The instantiation of the meta client on the the read path in the `hudi-common` module has been replaced with the usage of `HoodieStorage` instance.\r\n\r\nNote that, since `HoodieStorage` instance is intended to be not serializable, `HoodieTableMetaClient` still holds the `storageConf` instance which is serializable, which can be sent from the Spark driver to the executor.  In that way, the meta client still has the `storageConf` after deserialization on the executor (sent from driver), and the `HoodieStorage` is instantiated first by leveraging the storage configuration, i.e., `getStorage()` instantiates `this.storage` if it is null.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nSimplifies Trino Hudi connector integration.\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n###

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR simplifies `HoodieStorage` instance fetching to pass down the `HoodieStorage` instance from the meta client as much as possible, instead of using reflection, which may not work with a given file system instance like `TrinoFileSystem` instance.\r\n\r\nThe major changes in this PR include:\r\n- Introduces a new config `hoodie.storage.class` for instantiation of `HoodieStorage` class in Spark engine only.\r\n- Makes `HoodieIOFactory` to instantiate with `HoodieStorage` instance and use the instance for creating readers and writers; makes `HoodieStorage` to store the `StorageConfiguration` instance and adds a new API `#newInstance` to `HoodieStorage`.\r\n- Removes usage of `HoodieStorageUtils.getStorage` on the read path in `hudi-common` and `hudi-io` modules. Before this PR, `HoodieStorage` instantiated through reflection with the path and storage configuration through `HoodieStorageUtils.getStorage` does not work with a provided file system instance like `TrinoFileSystem`.  With this PR, `HoodieStorage` instance is passed down from the meta client as much as possible.  For engines like Spark, we still have the reflection code for `HoodieHadoopStorage` to make it work on the executor side.\r\n- Refactors the code so that the `HoodieStorage` is passed down to the places it is needed.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nAs above.\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nWe occasionally this duplicate keys being ingested to RLI partition in MDT. Fixing the root cause in this patch. \r\n\r\nRoot cause:\r\nAfter fetching record locations from RLI partition in MDT, before doing snapshot read to honor payload merge and ordering field, we fetch unique Partition and fileId pairs. Instead of fetching unique pair of {Partition, fileId}s, we were using [HoodieRecordGlobalLocation](https://github.com/apache/hudi/blob/e4b56b090fdcb76416c60bd7ddd4247f0955c152/hudi-client/hudi-client-common/src/main/java/org/apache/hudi/index/HoodieIndexUtils.java#L298) which also contains \"instantTime\" in addition to partition path and fileId. So, this was resulting in 1 record from incoming resulting in 2 to 3 or N records after joining because of this. \r\n\r\nI have written tests to reproduce the issue. If not for the fix, we will encounter below exception \r\n```\r\n\r\nCaused by: org.apache.hudi.exception.HoodieAppendException: Failed while appending records to

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis MR fixes issue https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/11044.\r\n`hoodie.datasource.write.row.writer.enable` is `true` by default, and for `BULK_INSERT` operation there is a shortcut in `HoodieSparkSqlWriter.writeInternal()`, which leads to ignoring of `hoodie.combine.before.insert` parameter even it was set explicitly by user.\r\nAdded corresponding unit test, and also checked that the issue is fixed when PySpark with linked `hudi-spark-bundle` jar is used. (Made separate public repository for issues quick check if anyone would like to reuse it: https://github.com/geserdugarov/test-hudi-issues/)\r\nThe mentioned shortcut should be revisited, created separate Jira task [HUDI-7757](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-7757).\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nLow\r\n\r\n###

Change Logs\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** This is the revision of #10487 but for 0.x line and improvements to avoid unnecessary listing. The description is copied from the original PR, however please check **Testing** section below which lists out the coverage and other error injection tests that we ran for this patch.\r\n\r\nWe are looking to fix two problems by adding per log file marker. \r\na. i. MOR data table rollbacks missed to sync original log files from failed commit to MDT. \r\na.ii. Along these lines, if rollback instant is retried multiple times, any log files added from failed rollback attempts should also be synced to MDT. \r\nb. If there are spurious log files created even w/ successful commits, we need to ensure these spurious log files are also synced to MDT. \r\n\r\nSo, to fix all of the above, we are adding per log file marker. Any log file added or appended to will create markers. We don't really need to distinguish between create and append and so we will go w/ APPEND IoType for markers. \r\n\r\nFix for (a. i): Any log file added will emit a marker. If the commit of interest failed, hudi will trigger a rollback. During rollback planning, using markers we identify the original log files added by the failed commit and track it as part of the rollback plan. This also gets tracked in HoodieRollbackMetadata (had to upgrade the schema for this purpose). \r\n\r\nFix for (a.ii): Whenever a rollback is triggered, hudi adds a rollback command block. With this patch, we are also emitting markers for such log files. During rollback execution, apart from adding log files added by failed commit to HoodieRollbackMetadata, we also add these log files which could have been added by previous attempts of rollback for the same instant. \r\n\r\nFix for (b): During marker based reconciliation step, we check for log files from markers and compare it against HoodieCommitMetadata's HoodieWriteStat. If for any additional files tracked using markers (which could happen due to spark retries), we will add new  HoodieWriteStat and update HoodieCommitMetadata. So, that when this syncs to MDT, we don't miss to track this spurious log files. We will use https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/9545 to skip such spurious log files on the reader side. So, on the writer side, we just want to ensure we don't miss to track any log file created by hudi. \r\n\r\nNote: Please do note that the reconciliation for log files is kind of opposite of what happens w/ data files. w/ data files, any extraneous files are deleted. But for any extaneous log files, we can't afford to delete. Since there could be a concurrent reader trying to read the the file slice of interest. Eventually during execution, it might parse the log block header and might skip if its partially failed commit or inflight commit. Anyways, in short, we can't afford to delete any log files at any point in time except cleaner. So, for any extraneous log files detected, we fix the HoodieCommitMetadata to track these additional log files as well. \r\n\r\nNotes to reviewers to assist in reviewing: \r\n\r\nI will break down diff set of changes and the classes to review for the same. \r\n\r\n1. Adding per log file marker for regular log files: Added a callback(AppendLogWriteCallback) for this purpose since we may not know the log file name upfront (unlike data files). New apis are introduced to Markers for this purpose. \r\nCheck files HoodieWriteHandle, HoodieAppendHandle, HoodieLogFormatWriter, HoodieLogFormat, HoodieLogFileWriterCallback\r\nDirectWriterMarkers, TimelineServerBasedMarkers, WriteMarkers, RequestHandler. \r\n\r\n2. Schema upgrade for rollback metadata. \r\n   Check file HoodieRollbackMetadata.avsc\r\n\r\n3. Rollback from DT when synced to MDT: w/ the schema upgrade, we will fetch \"logFilesFromFailedCommit\" in HoodieRollbackMetadata and make a delta commit to MDT. \r\n HoodieBackedTableMetadataWriter and HoodieTableMetadataUtil.\r\n\r\n4.Rollback plan changes:\r\nWhen using Marker based rollback strategy, we poll markers to find the log files added. Apart from log file names, we also need the actual size. So, we do fs listing to fetch the file lengths. We track these as part of HoodieRollbackRequest.logFilesWithBlocksToRollback. There are chances that some files could be missing which are tracked in markers. We can ignore these files since this could happen (just after creating marker file, lets say the process crashed w/o creating the actual log files)\r\nClasses to check: MarkerBasedRollbackStrategy\r\n\r\n5. New argument to StorageScheme named listStatusUnfriendly. Depending on storage scheme, the file system based listing to triage the actual size of the log files of interest could change. As per this patch, we only have one way to do this. But in a follow up patch, we might have to fix that. \r\n\r\n6. Fixing HoodieCommitMetadata to include HoodieWriteStat for any missing log files which are extraneous through markers. \r\nClasses to check: SparkRDDWriteClient.commit and addMissingLogFileIfNeeded(). This also includes the file system listing to fetch the actual size of spurious log files if any. \r\n\r\n7. Rollback execution: \r\na. With this patch, we are also emitting markers for rollback command blocks (log files). \r\nb. During execution, we also need to fetch any log files added by previous attempts of rollback and update HoodieRollbackSat if need be. Note that we can have only one HoodieRollbackPlan per partition. \r\nClasses: BaseRollbackHelper. \r\n\r\n8. Misc: \r\nHoodiePairData to add join() support. HoodieListPairData, HoodieJavaPairRDD.\r\nFsUtils.getFileStatusesUnderPartition to assist in fetching file statuses for some interested log files. \r\n\r\n**Testing**:\r\n\r\nBelow tests are covered in this PR. Here, we are generating log files with marker and injecting failures and then validating using fs view\r\n1. simple insert directly to log files followed by compaction\r\n2. rollback after failure before updating MDT\r\n3. rollback after failure during updating MDT\r\n3. rollback after failure after updating MDT\r\n4. insert followed by upsert and then failed rollback\r\n5. same as above and then reattempt rollback\r\n\r\nApart from these, we have a bunch of other tests covering metadata validation for the general workflows.\r\n\r\nLong running error injection tests:\r\n1. MOR w/ async cleaning, compaction, MDT enabled, no RLI\r\n2. MOR w/ async cleaning, compaction, inline clustering, MDT enabled, no RLI\r\n3. MOR w/ async cleaning, compaction, MDT enabled, RLI enabled\r\n4. MOR w/ async cleaning, compaction, inline clustering MDT enabled, RLI enabled\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nMDT in sync with filesystem\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nhigh\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change. If not, put \"none\"._\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nuse basefileutils in table schema resolver and get rid of MessageType so that we can remove hadoop deps from table schema resolver. Even though MessageType isn't dependent on hadoop, the AvroConversionUtil is so we would need to replace that library with something else. It was much easier to just stick with avro Schema in most cases\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nhelps get rid of hadoop from hudi common\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's
