SUMMARY\r\n\r\n`Metric` from `@superset-ui/chart-controls` is a TypeScript type, which cannot be used in a JSX file and `PropTypes`---it'd just become `undefined` at compile time. We noticed this because our internal CI is failing because of the bad imports (we have a couple of somewhat stricter Jest tests that uses some `superset-frontend` components).\r\n\r\nAlso remove another reference of `@superset-ui/chart-controls/lib/...`----we shouldn't import `lib` files directly unless absolutely necessary as it sometimes messes up with `npm link`.\r\n\r\ncc @kgabryje

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nFeature flag typing [has been added to `@superset-ui/core`](https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui/pull/982), since there is now two copies of the same typing, sometimes it leads to TS errors when `npm link` is used or when in Jest.\r\n\r\nThis change means all future feature flags used in the front-end have to be added to `@superset-ui` and go through the npm publish process. This is inconvenient but probably necessary to ensure correctness and consistency. Considering we are merging `superset-ui` to this repo soon, this should not be that much of a problem.\r\n\r\ncc @graceguo-supercat @villebro \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\n1. `npm link ../superset-ui/packages/superset-ui-core`\r\n2. `npm run type`\r\n3. You will see this error in `master`: \r\n\r\n```\r\nnode_modules/@superset-ui/core/src/utils/featureFlags.ts:53:5 - error TS2717: Subsequent property declarations must have the same type.

SUMMARY\r\nChanges the helm template to make calling both pip and apt-get install conditional on packages/requirements being present.\r\n\r\nAllows easy extension of Superset by an end user to include packages that may not be suitable for baseline superset. Also makes testing and iteration a bit faster.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n#### In existing superset:master:\r\n```bash\r\ncd helm/superset\r\nhelm dependency update\r\nhelm template -s templates/secret-superset-config.yaml . \\\r\n  | ggrep -oP '\\s+superset_bootstrap\\.sh: \\K.+' \\\r\n  | base64 -d\r\n```\r\nExpected output:\r\n```bash\r\n#!/bin/sh\r\n\r\npip install psycopg2==2.8.5 redis==3.2.1 \r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n#### In PR branch:\r\n```bash\r\ncd helm/superset\r\nhelm dependency update\r\nhelm template -s templates/secret-superset-config.yaml . \\\r\n  | ggrep -oP '\\s+superset_bootstrap\\.sh: \\K.+' \\\r\n  | base64 -d\r\n```\r\nExpected output:\r\n```bash\r\n#!/bin/sh\r\n\r\npip install psycopg2==2.8.5 redis==3.2.1 \r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### Now, the changes:\r\nRun:\r\n```bash\r\nhelm template -s templates/secret-superset-config.yaml . -f - <<<\\\r\n\"\r\nadditionalAptPackages:\r\n  - socat\r\n  - nano\r\nadditionalRequirements: \r\n  - Authlib\r\n\" \\\r\n  | ggrep -oP '\\s+superset_bootstrap\\.sh: \\K.+' \\\r\n  | base64 -d\r\n```\r\nExpected output:\r\n```bash\r\n#!/bin/sh\r\n\r\napt-get update -y \\\r\n  && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \\\r\n     socat nano \\\r\n  && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*\r\n\r\npip install Authlib \r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### Finally, removing both lists:\r\n```bash\r\nhelm template -s templates/secret-superset-config.yaml . -f - <<<\\\r\n\"\r\nadditionalAptPackages: {}\r\nadditionalRequirements: {}\r\n\" \\\r\n  | ggrep -oP '\\s+superset_bootstrap\\.sh: \\K.+' \\\r\n  | base64 -d\r\n```\r\n\r\nExpected output:\r\n```bash\r\n#!/bin/sh\r\n```\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\"

SUMMARY\r\nAttempts to implement [carry-forward flags](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/carryforward-flags) for codecov as proposed [here](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/9930#issuecomment-785978529)\r\n\r\nThe goal is that for any new commits, codecov will pull coverage data for unchanged areas of the codebase from previous commits, only recalculating coverage for areas of the codebase that have changed.  \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nTesting will involve waiting for CI to see if the carry-forward flags are working as intended and continuing to tweak until it's working\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Requires DB Migration.\r\n-

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThe Slack dashboard in the examples has 2 charts that show no data, since the time range (\"last

SUMMARY\r\nAdds tests to dnd controls. \r\n\r\n@kgabryje We are auditing the codebase of Explore searching for components that don‚Äôt have sufficient test coverage (at least 80%). We are using Codecov reports to find the components. From what I understood this feature is still in POC mode, right? Anyway, I added some test files here to help with the test coverage and serve as a base for more complete tests. Can you please review it?  \r\n\r\nPS: `DndMetricSelect.test.tsx` has only one test. After we add typescript support to  `DndMetricSelect` `props` we should complement this.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n1 - Execute all drag and drop tests.\r\n2 - All tests should pass.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Requires DB Migration.\r\n- [ ] Confirm DB Migration upgrade and downgrade tested.\r\n- [ ] Introduces new feature or

SUMMARY\r\nAdd support for temporal and boolean options to native filters. To facilitate this, a custom SQLAlchemy type is introduced to handle literal binds using `datetime` objects. In addition, the select Select filter component implements a formatter to show only the relevant digits of the timestamp - `YYYY-MM-DD` for dates, and `YYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` for hours-seconds and full `YYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.MMMMMM` for sub-second timestamps.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nDropdown options for filter on date column:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/111066945-63597780-84ca-11eb-89b5-e69f05b2ce75.png)\r\n\r\nDropdown options for filter on datetime column.

SUMMARY\r\nTwo parts:\r\n1. superset-extra-config configMap was not attached to the deployment container\r\n2. You cannot use \".\" inside a range with tpl. Instead \"$\" for global context can be used.\r\n    - Reference https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/5979\r\n\r\nI also cleaned up the template slightly to result in the desired formatting no matter the input whitespace, thanks to @Yann-J for the feedback.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n1. Attempt to use extraConfigs:\r\n```bash\r\ntest_config=$(cat<<'EOF'\r\nextraConfigs:\r\n  test.yaml: |\r\n    test data\r\nEOF\r\n)\r\nhelm template deploytest superset -f - <<<\"${test_config}\"\r\n```\r\n2. See error:\r\n```\r\nError: template: superset/templates/configmap-superset.yaml:30:16: executing \"superset/templates/configmap-superset.yaml\" at <.>: wrong type for value; expected chartutil.Values; got string\r\n```\r\n3. Apply this PR.\r\n4. Attempt to use extraConfigs\r\n5. Template builds configs, including volume maps\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing

With this PR patch, attempt to use authentication_method=PLAIN with Impala or auth=CUSTOM with PyHive\r\n    `sudo docker run --rm -it -u 0 --entrypoint bash superset:fix-sasl-module`\r\n1. See authentication error if you dont have a hive cluster to test against and use ascend with invalid credentials, otherwise see no errors because the connection

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR adds a few UX improvements to dnd feature implemented in https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/13575:\r\n\r\n1. Display a ghost button in all DnD components to indicate that user can drop a metric or column in that component.\r\n2. When user starts dragging a column or a metric, display dashed border around control boxes in which the dragged element can be dropped (before - the border was displayed only when user was hovering over a control box)\r\n3. When user drops a saved metric in metrics control box, instead of opening a popover, the metric is created immediately.\r\n\r\nIn order to test the changes, make sure that `ENABLE_EXPLORE_DRAG_AND_DROP` feature flag is enabled\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

Add ErrorBoundary to control items, so a JS error in a single chart control does not crash the whole page. Error may happen more often with the addition of more and more custom controls.\r\n2. Allow `CollectionControl` to load control components from `@superset-ui/chart-controls`' `sharedControlComponents`. The plan is to move all control components to `chart-controls` so they have better isolation and less dependencies. Currently new DnD controls are still added to `superset-frontend`, that's fine, too. We'll consolidate both once [the monorepo merge](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13013) is completed.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n#### Before\r\n\r\nA JS error may cause the whole page to crash.\r\n\r\n#### After\r\n\r\n<img width=\"401\" alt=\"wrap-control-error\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/335541/110876396-446da200-828c-11eb-8821-4e131f01a6f8.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\nTested manually\r\n\r\n1.

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR process edge cases for filter sets:\r\n1. When some filter was removed from dashboard we mark it as removed and not apply when user clicks on filter set\r\n2. When for some filter was changed metadata we mark it as highlighted and not apply when user clicks on filter set\r\n3. Added option invalidate filter set - removed invalid filters from filter set\r\n4. Saving in dashboard metadata also filters metadata for each filter set\r\n5. Added option edit name for filter set\r\n6. Added option select filter set with invalid filters in this case only valid filters will be applied and this superset will be selected\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR implements creating adhoc metrics by dragging columns and saved metrics from datasource panel to metrics control. \r\nWhen user drops a column or saved metric, a popover opens pre-filled with values - if a metric was dropped, a \"Saved metrics\" tab is open by default with a proper metric selected, otherwise \"Simple\" tab is open with a column selected.\r\nThe old functionality of creating a metric by clicking a \"plus\" button has ben removed.\r\nTo use the feature, enable `ENABLE_EXPLORE_DRAG_AND_DROP` feature flag and use changes from https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui/pull/1004.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

SUMMARY\r\nFixes issue with template params modal not opening when value was null. \r\nI converted one file to tsx so that we can put a null check on the code argument in TemplateParamsEditor, but it won't help much until the rest of the files are converted. I also made the initial state undefined instead of null so that we can use default args downstream. Lastly, I put in a check at the ace editor itself to never accept a null or undefined value, but pass an empty string in that case. \r\n\r\nfixes https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13540\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nsee #13540 for before state (no modal opens)\r\n\r\nafter:\r\n<img width=\"931\" alt=\"Screenshot_3_10_21__7_32_PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5186919/110731908-08790500-81d8-11eb-8d03-da7e8ac3deab.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nunit tests aren't completely reliable when it comes to passing a null value to ace editor. It was difficult to reproduce the issue in the tests. I wrote tests around the new code to ensure that we are using undefined instead of null.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nIt's annoying sometimes when I run [a unit test using the `birth_names` fixture](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/b9884fb55bdf40cc7f073d2b758f43a5b6265d6c/tests/query_context_tests.py#L320), it will drop the whole `birth_names` table in the example database once the test is finished. I can't remember how many times I had to run `superset load_examples` to add the data back.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a `test` database just for running tests and makes sure all applicable Python unit tests (those using ad-hoc fixtures instead of actual examples data) are run on the test database instead of examples.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\nNo functional changes. CI should pass. Running a single unit test with `load_birth_names_dashboard_with_slices` fixture should not drop the `birth_names` table.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\"

type to rison\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThe url for favorite status does not match the actual server url, so `.../favorite_status` was getting redirected by flask to `.../favorite_status/`, since flask doesn't know about SSL config (when it's done at the load balancer/proxy level) flask returns a 308 using the http protocol. This PR updates the endpoint to match the one on the server, as well as converts the request type to `rison` which should make the request query params more readable. \r\n \r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nN/A\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\nManual testing (local): \r\n- confirm favorite status is fetched without errors\r\n- confirm that the response is not 308\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\"

SUMMARY\r\nAthena API has a query size limit of 262144 bytes. Pandas `to_sql` will try to execute an INSERT INTO containing all records, which fails if the file is too large due to this limitation. \r\n\r\nThe PyAthena DBAPI provides [helper methods](https://github.com/laughingman7743/PyAthena/#to-sql) that work around this limitation. This PR modifies Athena's db_engine_specs, adding an override to `create_table_from_csv` that defers to PyAthena's `to_csv` helper method when appropriate.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nTry uploading CSV file larger than ~250kB\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has

SUMMARY\r\nFixes `PropertiesModal_spec` error in Node 15.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1320\" alt=\"109978301-81f68c00-7cdc-11eb-826c-86a3874da8fa\"

rejections](https://developer.ibm.com/languages/node-js/blogs/nodejs-15-release-blog/). In previous versions of Node, promise rejections are handled as warnings, so the test pass but that doesn't mean that the test is correct. I fixed the code that was causing the promise rejection and now the test also passes in Node 15.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n1 - Execute `PropertiesModal_spec` tests\r\n2 - All tests should pass\r\n\r\n@rusackas @simcha90 \r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Requires DB Migration.\r\n- [ ] Confirm DB Migration upgrade and downgrade tested.\r\n- [ ] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nAdding a new endpoint that gets the dataset metadata for a dashboard.\r\n\r\nThis is intended to replace the template-loaded bootstrap data on the dashboard page. In keeping with the precedent set by the existing bootstrap data, I have opted to return data in the same shape (a map of datasets) rather than a list, and to copy the bootstrap data's \"trimming\" behavior where any data unnecessary for rendering the dashboard is stripped out of the result. I don't believe these design decisions make for the ideal endpoint, but they do reduce potential regressions in the Single Page App project.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\n\r\nWrote unit tests, tested manually\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are

SUMMARY\r\nThis is the logic for the migration that can be found here: https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/14234\r\n\r\nWhat this does is that it assigns one of five categories to each query based on if there is a limiting factor in the results that the query is grabbing. This is in order to create more intelligent error messages in the superset frontend. \r\n\r\n### Reason\r\nWill be used in the frontend for better user facing messages. Previously several users had complained that they had downloaded the CSV of a query not realizing that the query had been limited either by the dropdown select or their own query parameters. This column will address using backend logic to determine what type of limiting factor, if any, has been placed on the query.\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n###

SUMMARY\r\nIn attempting to use Apache Superset with Teradata, we observed the following:\r\n\r\n[Topic 1] The connection instructions provided at https://superset.apache.org/docs/databases/teradata can be updated to the latest and most efficient way to connect to an Advanced SQL Engine (formerly Teradata Database) of a Teradata Vantage system.\r\n[Topic 2] Most critically, with the current Superset codebase (as of apache-superset v.1.0.1) an error occurs when attempting to perform a simple SELECT query in the SQL Lab; see Figure 1 below. Namely, observe in Figure 1 the \"Syntax Error: expected something between the word '<table_Name>' and the 'LIMIT' keyword\". The root cause for this error is the improper translation to Teradata SQL of the 'LIMIT' keyword in the Superset back-end. Teradata SQL uses the 'TOP' or 'SAMPLE' keywords instead of 'LIMIT'. Observe that issue #11405 appears to be closely related to this issue.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33156805/110385813-a7590200-801c-11eb-95c4-ea227cd032c4.png)\r\n \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33156805/110385894-c6579400-801c-11eb-8a54-fe4e0f938157.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33156805/110385924-cfe0fc00-801c-11eb-8b10-d2b169d3545e.png)\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nThis solution works and is tested with Teradata Vantage, but we are happy to make other modifications if the team supports. \r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n\r\nThe request all realtes to the follwoing bug \r\n\r\nNew or Changed Public Interfaces\r\nThe present proposal requires no new or changed public interfaces.\r\n\r\nNew dependencies\r\nOnly for Teradata connections, the present proposal requires the installation of\r\n\r\nthe teradatasqlalchemy connector, and\r\nthe teradatasql driver\r\npackages to connect to a Teradata Vantage system Advanced SQL Engine Database.\r\nThese packages are actively maintained and their licenses are Teradata proprietary. The teradatasql license can be found at:\r\nhttps://github.com/Teradata/python-driver/blob/master/LICENSE\r\nwhereas the teradatasqlalchemy code is not publicly posted at this point.\r\n\r\nMigration Plan and Compatibility\r\nNo migration is necessary. The proposed code changes are an extension and non-destructive to the existing code, thus not affecting existing compatibility.\r\n\r\nRejected Alternatives\r\nNo alternative approaches have been considered or rejected.\r\n","created_at":"2021-03-08T21:48:23Z","updated_at":"2021-10-19T00:37:54Z","closed_at":"2021-10-19T00:37:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"36bc9877b0dc2b7d493f9170dbc290c2e0d5c191","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1329338104,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzI5MzM4MTA0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/size/XL","name":"size/XL","color":"5C3BBc","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/pulls/13519/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/pulls/13519/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/13519/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/statuses/f09d5aa70aa4886f27f5c35aa787ef5d6cc6166a","head":{"label":"mccushjack:master","ref":"master","sha":"f09d5aa70aa4886f27f5c35aa787ef5d6cc6166a","user":{"login":"mccushjack","id":33156805,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMTU2ODA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33156805?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mccushjack","html_url":"https://github.com/mccushjack","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mccushjack/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mccushjack/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mccushjack/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mccushjack/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mccushjack/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mccushjack/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mccushjack/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mccushjack/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mccushjack/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"139c7878a511446ddb2e7f6efdd95e33d6f572c5","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":39464018,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTQ2NDAxOA==","name":"superset","full_name":"apache/superset","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset","description":"Apache
