Primarily cleanup MockRecordCollectors: remove unnecessary anonymous inheritance but just consolidate on the NoOpRecordCollector -> renamed to MockRecordCollector. Most relevant changes are unit tests that would be relying on this MockRecordCollector.\r\n\r\n2. Let StandbyContextImpl#recordCollector() to return null instead of returning a no-op collector, since in standby tasks we should ALWAYS bypass the logging logic and only use the inner store for restoreBatch. Returning null helps us to realize this assertion failed as NPE as early as possible whereas a no-op collector just hides the bug.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [

create topic api do not work with older version of the api. It can be reproduced by trying to create a topic with `kafka-topics.sh` from 2.3. It timeouts.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/kafka/commit/b94c7f479b917d4ec602c31a24f11390627c479b has added a check which raises an exception if a field has been set to a non-default value unless the field is marked as \"ignorable\".\r\n\r\nThe fields added in the version 5 of the response are always set regardless of the version used by the client. If an older version is used, an exception is thrown during the serialization because the fields have non-default values. We should either not set the fields for older versions in the api layer or mark them as ignorable. I have chosen the later in this case because it looks cleaner.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage

upgrade system test correctly rolls by upgrading the broker and \r\nleaving the IBP, and then rolling again with the latest IBP version.\r\nUnfortunately, this is not sufficient to pick up many problems in our IBP\r\ngating as we charge through the rolls and after the second roll all of\r\nthe brokers will rejoin the ISR and the test will be treated as a\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nI have tested this theory by testing the upgrade test with single roll\r\nIBP bumps. \"java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Invalid version\" exceptions\r\nwere encountered on brokers, but the test still passed.\r\n\r\nThis test adds two new checks:\r\n1. We wait for the ISR to stabilize for all partitions. This is best\r\npractice during rolls, and is enough to tell us if a broker hasn't\r\nrejoined after each roll.\r\n2. We check the broker logs for some common protocol errors. This is a\r\nfail safe as it's possible for the test to be successful even if some\r\nprotocols are incompatible and the ISR is rejoined.","created_at":"2019-12-12T23:39:03Z","updated_at":"2019-12-30T19:02:30Z","closed_at":"2019-12-30T19:02:30Z","merged_at":"2019-12-30T19:02:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"8fd7cd6a439a3914b49f7c6919e84e6937ee5a18","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/7827/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/7827/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/7827/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/0d632598cfb18afab20b441c2da98a91d1baef11","head":{"label":"lbradstreet:upgrade-test-exception-checks","ref":"upgrade-test-exception-checks","sha":"0d632598cfb18afab20b441c2da98a91d1baef11","user":{"login":"lbradstreet","id":252189,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/252189?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet","html_url":"https://github.com/lbradstreet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":154184520,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTQxODQ1MjA=","name":"kafka","full_name":"lbradstreet/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lbradstreet","id":252189,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/252189?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet","html_url":"https://github.com/lbradstreet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lbradstreet/kafka","description":"Mirror

NamedCache we currently flush _all_ dirty entries in the cache any time an eviction occurs. Since we don't batch the writes, there's not much benefit to flushing everything. Modifying this behavior to only flush the LRU entry would improve the cache in two ways\r\n\r\n1) Makes it more effective at what it does, namely: reducing downstream traffic and writes to the underlying store\r\n2) Helps reduce a source of overcounting with _at_least_once_. Without a cache, all records will immediately go into the changelog. If you process N records and then crash before the next commit, on recovery all N records will be loaded into the state store but the task will be resumed from the previous commit, causing these records to be processed twice/overcounted. Buffering  entries in the cache for as long as possible before the next commit means fewer records at risk of being overcounted","created_at":"2019-12-12T01:37:46Z","updated_at":"2023-01-06T02:31:02Z","closed_at":"2023-01-06T02:31:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6d50569b409922ed4d9ef66d1a3db3f3598be2b1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":820747028,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjA3NDcwMjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/streams","name":"streams","color":"63edea","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/7824/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/7824/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/7824/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/255cc021d4fd432baa23d1851fb2bf5780b92925","head":{"label":"ableegoldman:MINOR-flush-only-evicted-key","ref":"MINOR-flush-only-evicted-key","sha":"255cc021d4fd432baa23d1851fb2bf5780b92925","user":{"login":"ableegoldman","id":4843099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NDMwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4843099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman","html_url":"https://github.com/ableegoldman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":166325386,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjYzMjUzODY=","name":"kafka","full_name":"ableegoldman/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ableegoldman","id":4843099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NDMwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4843099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman","html_url":"https://github.com/ableegoldman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ableegoldman/kafka","description":"Mirror

a subtle bug in the Connect framework that hasn't been a common issue due to the patterns many connector developers follow for their `Connector::taskConfigs` method (more on the cause of this is outlined in the Jira issue). It's possible that reconfiguring a connector but only altering its converters and/or Kafka clients will fail to propagate to the connector's tasks.\r\n\r\nThis change should fix that bug by caching the client and converter configs for running connectors in the herder and, if a change is detected to any of those configs, force a restart of the connector's tasks. This is done in both the standalone and distributed herder.\r\n\r\nA unit test is added for the shared converter/client config extraction logic, and an integration test is added to confirm the fix which fails on the current `trunk` but passes on the source branch of this PR.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

time.\r\n\r\nShould be backported to `2.4` and `2.3`.\r\n\r\nIncreasing the timeout (see #7789) was not sufficient. \r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify

support for TLSv1.3 in SslTransportLayer. Note that TLSv1.3 is only enabled from Java 11 onwards, so we test the code only when running with Java11 and above.\r\n\r\nTests run on this PR:\r\n  - SslTransportLayerTest: This covers testing of our SslTransportLayer and all tests are run with TLSv1.3 when running with Java 11. These tests are also run with TLSv1.2 for all Java versions\r\n  - SslFactoryTest: Also run with TLSv1.3 on Java 11 onwards in addition to TLSv1.2 for all Java versions\r\n  - SslEndToEndAuthorizationTest - Run only with TLSv1.3 on Java 11 onwards and only with TLSv1.2 on earlier Java versions. We have other versions of this test which use SSL that continue to be with TLSv1.2 on Java 11 to avoid reducing test coverage for TLSv1.2\r\n \r\nAdditional testing for TLSv1.3:\r\n  - Most tests that use SSL use TestSslUtils.DEFAULT_TLS_PROTOCOL_FOR_TESTS which is set to TLSv1.2. I have run all `clients` and `core` tests with `DEFAULT_TLS_PROTOCOL_FOR_TESTS=TLSv1.3` with Java 11.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

improved fetch semantics by adding leader epoch validation. This relies on\r\nreliable propagation of leader epoch information from the controller. Unfortunately, we\r\nhave encountered a bug during partition reassignment in which the leader epoch in the\r\ncontroller context does not get properly updated. This causes UpdateMetadata requests\r\nto be sent with stale epoch information which results in the metadata caches on the\r\nbrokers falling out of sync.\r\n\r\nThis bug has existed for a long time, but it is only a problem due to the new epoch\r\nvalidation done by the client. Because the client includes the stale leader epoch in its\r\nrequests, the leader rejects them, yet the stale metadata cache on the brokers prevents\r\nthe consumer from getting the latest epoch. Hence the consumer cannot make progress\r\nwhile a reassignment is ongoing.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is straightforward to fix this problem in the controller for the new releases\r\n(which this patch does), it is not so easy to fix older brokers which means new clients\r\ncould still encounter brokers with this bug. To address this problem, this patch also\r\nmodifies the client to treat the leader epoch returned from the Metadata response as\r\n\"unreliable\" if it comes from an older version of the protocol. The client in this case will\r\ndiscard the returned epoch and it won't be included in any requests.\r\n\r\nAlso, note that the correct epoch is still forwarded to replicas correctly in the\r\nLeaderAndIsr request, so this bug does not affect replication.\r\n\r\nThis is a cherry-pick of 5d0cb1419 to the 2.4 branch with the changes necessary to\r\nmake it work. Since the changes were not trivial, I submitted a pull request. Jason\r\nremains the author of the change.","created_at":"2019-12-09T02:21:11Z","updated_at":"2019-12-09T16:12:31Z","closed_at":"2019-12-09T16:12:31Z","merged_at":"2019-12-09T16:12:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"522b5177fd764d42aaa2bed4b146d4f4c0c595dd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/7800/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/7800/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/7800/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/522b5177fd764d42aaa2bed4b146d4f4c0c595dd","head":{"label":"ijuma:kafka-9212-2.4","ref":"kafka-9212-2.4","sha":"522b5177fd764d42aaa2bed4b146d4f4c0c595dd","user":{"login":"ijuma","id":24747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma","html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":32646946,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjY0Njk0Ng==","name":"kafka","full_name":"ijuma/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ijuma","id":24747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma","html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma/kafka","description":"Mirror

is possible for the user to call `commitTransaction` before a pending `AddPartitionsToTxn` call has returned. If the `AddPartitionsToTxn` call returns an abortable error, we need to cancel any pending batches in the accumulator and we need to fail the pending commit. The problem in this case is that `Sender.runOnce`, after failing the batches, enters `NetworkClient.poll` before it has a chance to cancel the commit. Since there are no pending requests at this time, this will block unnecessarily and prevent completion of the doomed commit. This patch fixes the problem by returning from `runOnce` if any batches have been aborted, which allows the commit to also fail without the delay.\r\n\r\nNote that this was the cause of the delay executing `AuthorizerIntegrationTest.testTransactionalProducerTopicAuthorizationExceptionInCommit` compared to other tests in this class. After fixing the bug, the delay is gone and the test time is similar to other test cases in the class.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and

improved fetch semantics by adding leader epoch validation. This relies on reliable propagation of leader epoch information from the controller. Unfortunately, we have encountered a bug during partition reassignment in which the leader epoch in the controller context does not get properly updated. This causes UpdateMetadata requests to be sent with stale epoch information which results in the metadata caches on the brokers falling out of sync. \r\n\r\nThis bug has existed for a long time, but it is only a problem due to the new epoch validation done by the client. Because the client includes the stale leader epoch in its requests, the leader rejects them, yet the stale metadata cache on the brokers prevents the consumer from getting the latest epoch. Hence the consumer cannot make progress while a reassignment is ongoing. \r\n\r\nAlthough it is straightforward to fix this problem in the controller for the new releases (which this patch does), it is not so easy to fix older brokers which means new clients could still encounter brokers with this bug. To address this problem, this patch also modifies the client to treat the leader epoch returned from the Metadata response as \"unreliable\" if it comes from an older version of the protocol. The client in this case will discard the returned epoch and it won't be included in any requests.\r\n\r\nAlso, note that the correct epoch is still forwarded to replicas correctly in the LeaderAndIsr request, so this bug does not affect replication.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build

see `TopicCommandWithAdminClientTest.testDescribeUnderReplicatedPartitionsWhenReassignmentIsInProgress` failing locally quite often, probably 30% of the time or more. After investigating, the failures are due to a race condition on reassignment completion. The previous code fetched metadata first and then fetched the reassignment state. It is possible in between those times for the reassignment to complete, which leads to spurious URPs being reported. The fix is to change the order of these checks and to explicitly check for reassignment completion.

between queries for requested JMX objects.\r\n\r\n### why\r\nSometimes it may take some time for the JMX metrics of an application to appear. It would be nice to be able to configure this timeout. On top of that, control over the backoff would be nice too.\r\n\r\n### TODOs\r\n- [ ] test the case where we don't specify these options\r\n- [ ] confirm that the backoff works as expected\r\n\r\n###

fixes problem with similar leak. The Log objects are being\r\nheld in ScheduledExecutor PeriodicProducerExpirationCheck callback. The\r\nfix in KAFKA-8448 was to change the policy of ScheduledExecutor to\r\nremove the scheduled task when it gets canceled (by calling\r\nsetRemoveOnCancelPolicy(true)).\r\n\r\nThis works when a log is closed using close() method. But when a log is\r\ndeleted either when the topic gets deleted or when the rebalancing\r\noperation moves the replica away from broker, the delete() operation is\r\ninvoked. Log.delete() doesn't close the pending scheduled task and that\r\nleaks Log instance.\r\n\r\nFix is to close the scheduled task in the Log.delete() method too.\r\n\r\nTested with and without this fix and Log instances are no longer leaked\r\nand scheduled tasks are gone once log is deleted.\r\n\r\n*More detailed description of your change,\r\nif necessary.

is a reduced scope fix for KAFKA-9261. The purpose of this patch is to ensure that partition leader state is kept in sync with broker metadata in `MetadataCache` and consequently in `Cluster`. Due to the possibility of metadata event reordering, it was possible for this state to be inconsistent which could lead to an NPE in some cases. The test case here provides a specific scenario where this could happen.\r\n\r\nAlso see #7770 for additional detail. \r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify

workers, defined as workers that lose connectivity with the Kafka broker coordinator and get kicked out of the group but don't experience a jvm restart, have been keeping their tasks running. This side-effect is more disrupting with the new Incremental Cooperative rebalance protocol. When such workers return: \r\na) they join the group with existing assignment and this leads to redundant tasks running in the Connect cluster, and\r\nb) they interfere with the computation of lost tasks, which before this fix would lead to the scheduled rebalance delay not being reset correctly back to 0. This results in periodic rebalances. \r\n\r\nThis fix focuses on resolving the above side-effects as follows: \r\n* Each worker now tracks its connectivity with the broker coordinator in an unblocking manner. This allows the worker to detect that the broker coordinator is unreachable. The timeout is set to be equal to the heartbeat interval. If during this time the connection remains inactive, the worker will proactively stop all its connectors and tasks and will keep attempting to connect to the coordinator. \r\n* The incremental cooperative assignor will keep the delay to a positive value as long as it can detect lost tasks. If the set of tasks that are computed as lost becomes empty, the delay will be set to zero and no additional rebalancing will be scheduled. \r\n\r\nBesides the test included in this PR, the improvements are being tested with a framework that deploys a Connect cluster on docker images and introduces network partitions between all or selected workers and the Kafka brokers. \r\n\r\n###

client caches metadata fetched from Metadata requests. Previously, each metadata response overwrote all of the metadata from the previous one, so we could rely on the expectation that the broker only returned the leaderId for a partition if it had connection information available. This behavior changed with KIP-320 since having the leader epoch allows the client to filter out partition metadata which is known to be stale. However, because of this, we can no longer rely on the request-level guarantee of leader availability. There is no mechanism similar to the leader epoch to track the staleness of broker metadata, so we still overwrite all of the broker metadata from each response, which means that the partition metadata can get out of sync with the broker metadata in the client's cache. Hence it is no longer safe to validate inside the `Cluster` constructor that each leader has an associated `Node`\r\n\r\nFixing this issue was unfortunately not straightforward because the cache was built to maintain references to broker metadata through the `Node` object at the partition level. In order to keep the state consistent, each `Node` reference would need to be updated based on the new broker metadata. Instead of doing that, this patch changes the cache so that it is structured more closely with the Metadata response schema. Broker node information is maintained at the top level in a single collection and cached partition metadata only references the id of the broker. To accommodate this, we have removed `PartitionInfoAndEpoch` and we have altered `MetadataResponse.PartitionMetadata` to eliminate its `Node` references.\r\n\r\nNote that one of the side benefits of the refactor here is that we virtually eliminate one of the hotspots in Metadata request handling in `MetadataCache.getEndpoints` (which was renamed to `maybeFilterAliveReplicas`). The only reason this was expensive was because we had to build a new collection for the `Node` representations of each of the replica lists. This information was doomed to just get discarded on serialization, so the whole effort was wasteful. Now, we work with the lower level id lists and no copy of the replicas is needed (at least for all versions other than 0).\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify

of https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-9156\r\n\r\nRace condition in concurrent  `get` method invocation of lazy indexes might lead to multiple `OffsetIndex`/`TimeIndex` objects being concurrently created. When that happens position of `MappedByteBuffer` in `AbstractIndex` is advanced to the last entry which in turn leads to a critical `BufferOverflowException` being thrown whenever leader or replica tries to append a record to the segment.\r\n\r\nMoreover, `file_=` setter is seemingly also vulnerable to the race, since multiple threads can attempt to set a new file reference as well as create new Time/OffsetIndex objects at the same time. This might lead to the discrepant File references being held by e.g. LazyTimeIndex and its TimeIndex counterpart.\r\n\r\nThis patch attempts to fix the issue by making sure that index objects are atomically constructed when loaded lazily via `get` method.
