What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\n[#3419](https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/3419) allowed to preserve commit metadata while clustering so as to support incremental queries with replacecommits in timeline. However, it also preserved filenames despite the writes due to clustering going to a new filegroup. This PR fixes that behavior.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *Modify AnnotationLocation checkstyle rule in checkstyle.xml*\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n*(Please

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nWhen a table created via deltastreamer has only one commit which is empty, there are chances that there is not schema (depending on how schema provider is set). \r\n\r\nIn such cases, if someone tries to do incremental read from this table, the commit metadata may not have any schema and hence results in NPE.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nFixed Incremental relation to return empty RDD on such cases. \r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n- I could not reproduce this locally as I tried w/ parquet DFS and used FileBasedSchemaProvider and so schema was populated and hence incremental query return empty dataframe. Will try to poke around to validate the fix. \r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n       \r\n - [ ] For large changes, please consider breaking it into sub-tasks under an umbrella

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n - HoodieMetadataMergedLogRecordReader#getRecordsByKeys() and its parent class methods\r\n   are not thread safe. When multiple queries come in for gettting log records\r\n   by keys, they all operate on the same log record reader instance provided by\r\n   HoodieBackedTableMetadata#openReadersIfNeeded() and they trip over each other\r\n   as they clear/put/get the same class memeber records.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n - The fix is to streamline the mutatation to class member records. Making\r\n   HoodieMetadataMergedLogRecordReader#getRecordsByKeys() a synchronized method\r\n   to avoid concurrent log records readers getting into NPE.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nAs of now, delete partitions will ensure all file groups are deleted, but the partition as such is not deleted. So, get all partitions might be returning the deleted partitions as well. but no data will be served since all file groups are deleted. With this patch, we are fixing it. We are letting cleaner take care of deleting the partitions when all file groups pertaining to a partitions are deleted. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Fixed the CleanPlanActionExecutor to return meta info about list of partitions to be deleted. If there are no valid file groups for a partition, clean planner will include the partition to be deleted. \r\n- Fixed HoodieCleanPlan avro schema to include the list of partitions to be deleted \r\n- CleanActionExecutor is fixed to delete partitions if any (as per clean plan)\r\n- Same info is added to HoodieCleanMetadata\r\n- Metadata table when applying clean metadata, will check for partitions to be deleted and will update the \"__all_partitions__\" record for the deleted partitions.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n- Added tests to TestHoodieBackedMetadata\r\n- Added tests to TestAlterTableDropPartition\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nSome operations in hudi may not add CHECKPOINT_KEY and CHECKPOINT_RESET_KEY like incline clustering, cleaning etc. So, deltastreamer should ignore those and go back to find the valid commit metadata from which hudi can fetch the checkpoint info. \r\nActual issue reported: User starts deltastreamer in continuous mode w/ inline clustering and provides a checkpoint to start with. After few commits shutsdown the job. And then restarts. Lets say incidentally last commit was replace commit (clustering). So, when deltastreamer starts, it checks for CHECKPOINT_KEY and last commit metadata which will not be present in replace commit and hence starts resuming from user provided checkpoint which should not happen. \r\nWith the fix in this patch, we go back to find the right commit metadata which has the CHECKPOINT_KEY or CHECKPOINT_RESET key and uses that to determine whether to go with checkpoint from this commit or to go with user provided one. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Fixed the way Deltastreamer fetches checkpoint info from commits. Goes back to find the right commit metadata. \r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis pull request is a trivial rework / code cleanup

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nNecessary changes so that we can use hudi-trino-bundle in the new trino connector. Do not merge yet. When we upgrade to hbase-2.x then we need to replace hbase-shaded-server by hbase-server and relocate in pom to avoid other conflicts, e.g. guava. hbase-shade-server is no longer maintained after hbase 1.7.1\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *Modify AnnotationLocation checkstyle rule in checkstyle.xml*\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nDuring clustering plan stage, we have filter partition inside the plan strategy class to narrow down partition candidates.\r\n\r\nThe partition filter logic is general enough to be reused across different strategy implementations. So this PR aims at abstracting the filter logic out of the strategy class and use a standalone config `ClusteringPlanPartitionFilterMode` to manage different filter criteria.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Remove `SparkRecentDaysClusteringPlanStrategy`, `SparkSelectedPartitionsClusteringPlanStrategy`, and `JavaRecentDaysClusteringPlanStrategy`. Their filter implementations are collected  to `ClusteringPlanPartitionFilter`\r\n- Add legacy check code, in order to avoid breaking user's pipeline.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - tests about filter criteria\r\n  - tests about the legacy config check\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [x] Has a corresponding

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n - The backing log format for the metadata table is HFile, a KeyValue type.\r\n   Since the key field in the metadata record payload is a duplicate of the\r\n   Key in the Cell, the redundant key field in the record can be emptied\r\n   to save on the cost.\r\n\r\n - HoodieHFileWriter and HoodieHFileDataBlock will now serialize records\r\n   with the key field emptied by default. HFile writer tries to find if\r\n   the record has metadata payload schema field 'key' and if so it does\r\n   the key trimming from the record payload.\r\n\r\n - HoodieHFileReader when reading the serialized records back from disk,\r\n   it materializes the missing keyFields if any. HFile reader tries to\r\n   find if the record has metadata payload schema fiels 'key' and if so\r\n   it does the key materialization in the record payload.\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** There is a generic version of this PR at https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/4447 \r\nwhere the reader/writers of the log/base HFile format would say what the actual key field is\r\nand the key deduplication and key materialization is done for the any such requested key field. \r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n - Tests have been added to verify the default virtual keys and key\r\n   deduplication support for the metadata table records.\r\n\r\n- Manually verified the serialized records on the disk are trimmed\r\n  off the key field\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n       \r\n - [ ] For large

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n - The backing log format for the metadata table is HFile, a KeyValue type.\r\n   Since the key field in the metadata record payload is a duplicate of the\r\n   Key in the Cell, the redundant key field in the record can be emptied\r\n   to save on the cost.\r\n\r\n - HoodieHFileWriter and HoodieHFileDataBlock will now serialize records\r\n   with the key field emptied by default. HFile writer level relies on the\r\n   callers to tell about the key field in the schema.\r\n\r\n - HoodieHFileReader when reading the serialized records back from disk,\r\n   it materializes the missing keyFields if any. It relies on the callers\r\n   to tell about the key field in the record schema.\r\n\r\n - WriteHandles and all its derived classes rely on the table properties\r\n   for the key field when constructing the file and log readers. This way\r\n   base file creation, append and merging all work seamlessly irrespective\r\n   of data or metadata table.\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** There is a simplified version of this PR at https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/4449\r\nwhere the HFile reader and writer would do key deduplication and key materialization only if \r\nthe record has the metadata payload schema field 'key' (the hardcoded version).\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n - Tests have been added to verify the default virtual keys and key\r\n   deduplication support for the metadata table records.\r\n\r\n - Manually verified the serialized records on the disk are trimmed\r\n   off the key field\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit

execution workload profile which including all fileGroup will be written into comparing with workload generated by input data. This will cover the case that insert data is written into some log files which is recognized as small file when using Hbase Index.\r\n2.  In such case, we cannot guarantee that all log files which contains only insert data could be deleted in rollback. They may be rollback using command block. So handle this case in compactor.\r\n3. Add some UT in spark client to test. \r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n  - Added integration tests for several components: partitioner \r\n  - Added integration tests for end-to-end: spark client\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ]

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nRestructure the bulk insert partitioner interface, to include the handling of fileIdPfx & write handle factory.\r\n\r\nWith this improvement, one can implement a new bulk_insert partitioner that is capable of routing records to pre-defined fileIds using customized write factory (e.g., different write factories for different partitions)\r\n\r\n[JIRA link](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-3085?filter=-2)\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Modify interface of `BulkInsertPartitioner`, to include the logic of handling `fileIdPrefix` and `writeHandlerFactory`. With this update, the partitioner of bulk_insert path now have ability to control records' final file group location (similar to the partitioner of the upsert path)\r\n- Modify bulk_insert write path (e.g., `AbstractBulkInsertHelper` and its subclasses) to make use of the new partitioner interface. Now the partitioner are mandatory (not optional anymore), similar to the standard upsert/insert path.\r\n- The java bulk_insert write path is mostly left untouched because of its specialty, e.g., always write to a single filegroup (i.e., parallelism=1) and has customized fileId generator `FileIdPrefixProvider`.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nAdded a fileId generation check to existing tests, and other parts are already covered by existing tests, such as `TestBulkInsertInternalPartitioner`.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [x] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [x] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n       \r\n - [ ] For large changes, please consider breaking it into sub-tasks under an umbrella

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nAt the write client layer, inline and async has a very tighter meaning. enabling inline compaction means, both scheduling and execution is inline. Same applies to clustering as well. If async config is enabled, both scheduling and execution has to be done async and regular writer will not do anything. But any scheduling has to be done in a coordinated manner or in other words, there should not be any other operation inflight. For eg, if someone has a separate process to schedule and execute compaction, they have to ensure no other writers are in progress while scheduling. If not, it might lead to data loss. Which means, this puts an extra burden for users to configure lock providers. But Hudi has the intelligence where scheduling can be done inline, but execution can be done async. Just that the configs aren't lined up well. So, adding two new configs named `hoodie.compact.schedule.inline` and `hoodie.clustering.schedule.inline`. When enabled, scheduling will happen inline by regular writers. And the expectation is that, users will have a separate job to execute the already scheduled ones. By this, users don't have to configure lock providers. With metadata table, this constraint might change, but if not for metadata table, users should have a way to exploit async execution of table services. \r\n\r\nNote:\r\nI have not fixed the deltastreamer flow yet.\r\n- Wanted to hear opinions if the approach is good.\r\n-Deltastreamer current state of things\r\nwhen async table services are enabled, scheduling will happen using explicit writeclient.scheduleClustering() and execution will happen in a different thread. We could potentially enable the new configs added as part of this patch and remove explicit scheduling calls from deltastreamer. Will take it up as a follow up. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *Modify AnnotationLocation checkstyle rule in checkstyle.xml*\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nWhen write data via TimestampBasedKeyGenerator which convert a filed as the partition field, the data type of original field presumably is not `StringType`.  then will lead an error when query.\r\n\r\nThis PR will recognize  `TimestampBasedKeyGenerator` or `TimestampBasedAvroKeyGenerator`, and force to use `StringType` as the data type.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *Modify AnnotationLocation checkstyle rule in checkstyle.xml*\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis

change log\r\n\r\n  - compact improve\r\n\r\nI found that when the compact plan is generated, the delta log files under each filegroup are arranged in the natural order of instant time. in the majority of cases,We can think that the latest data is in the latest delta log file, so we sort it from large to small according to the instance time, which can largely avoid rewriting the data in the compact process, and then optimize the compact time.\r\n\r\nIn addition, when reading the delta log file, we compare the data in the external spillablemap with the delta log data. If oldrecord is selected, there is no need to rewrite the data in the external spillablemap. Rewriting data will waste a lot of resources when data is spill to disk\r\n\r\nThis pull request is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\nCommitter
