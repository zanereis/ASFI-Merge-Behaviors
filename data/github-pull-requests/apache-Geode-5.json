 - gemfire.geode-for-redis-username\r\n  - gemfire.geode-for-redis-redundant-copies\r\n  - gemfire.geode-for-redis-enabled\r\n- Redis is enabled (using defaults) if the `enabled` property is set to\r\n  true OR if any of the other properties are explicitly set as java\r\n  system properties.\r\n- Introduce `RedisConfiguration` interface to access properties\r\n- Concrete implementation of `SystemPropertyBasedRedisConfiguration`\r\n  that uses system properties to define Radish properties.\r\n- Integration Tests use `TestRedisConfiguration` to avoid having to\r\n  set system properties.\r\n- Services started by Geode (`CacheService`s) that throw exceptions\r\n  during initialization will cause the Cache to fail to startup.\r\n  Previously any such errors were only logged.\r\n\r\n<!-- Thank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- In order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been

PROBLEM\r\n    \r\nOn JDK 17, `SslSocket.startHandshake()` can throw\r\n`SSLHandshakeException` in circumstances where JDK 8 and 11 would throw\r\n`SocketException`.\r\n    \r\n`SocketCreator.configureClientSSLSocket()` catches this exception, logs\r\nit as fatal, and rethrows it.\r\n    \r\n`ConnectionFactoryImpl.createClientToServerConnection()` then catches it\r\nand logs it as a warning.\r\n    \r\nThis results in lots of warn/fatal log entries for relatively benign\r\noccurrences that, on JDK 8 and 11, would result in debug entries.\r\n    \r\nAlso, `WANSSLDUnitTest.testSenderSSLReceiverNoSSL()` fails when it sees these\r\nunrecognized entries in the log.\r\n    \r\nSOLUTION\r\n    \r\nChange `SocketCreator` and `ConnectionFactoryImpl` to recognize when an\r\n`SSLHandshapeException` describes the kind of problem that would have\r\nthrown a `SocketException` on JDK8/11. If so, treat it the same as a\r\n`SocketException`. If not, treat it as a more serious\r\n`SSLHandshakeException`.","created_at":"2022-03-22T22:40:45Z","updated_at":"2022-03-29T17:02:51Z","closed_at":"2022-03-29T17:02:47Z","merged_at":"2022-03-29T17:02:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"fef6b163919db5f25db19ae5a9dc5b310ebcdace","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"Bill","id":4002,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4002?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bill","html_url":"https://github.com/Bill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bill/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"kamilla1201","id":6271754,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNzE3NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6271754?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamilla1201","html_url":"https://github.com/kamilla1201","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamilla1201/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamilla1201/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamilla1201/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamilla1201/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamilla1201/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamilla1201/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamilla1201/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamilla1201/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamilla1201/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"albertogpz","id":26227887,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjI3ODg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26227887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz","html_url":"https://github.com/albertogpz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/albertogpz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"kirklund","id":1444301,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDQzMDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1444301?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund","html_url":"https://github.com/kirklund","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"dschneider-pivotal","id":11197400,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTk3NDAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11197400?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal","html_url":"https://github.com/dschneider-pivotal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivo

caught in PR review if ever a problem; I feel there is bigger concern of forgetting to reset the custom branch when a new minor happens, so best for the script to still do

works)\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-03-18T01:22:12Z","updated_at":"2022-03-18T03:25:04Z","closed_at":"2022-03-18T03:11:14Z","merged_at":"2022-03-18T03:11:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"5e0a55777cca8b78a7ea53439370a29e5b1cabab","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"dickcav","id":1934150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzQxNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1934150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dickcav","html_url":"https://github.com/dickcav","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dickcav/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dickcav/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dickcav/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dickcav/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dickcav/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dickcav/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dickcav/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dickcav/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dickcav/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"demery-pivotal","id":45369324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzY5MzI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45369324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal","html_url":"https://github.com/demery-pivotal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/7458/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/7458/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/7458/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/statuses/7201bacc0195f9086aa4eaebcbb8c3a03cb666d5","head":{"label":"onichols-pivotal:GEODE-10137-add-jdk17-opt-in","ref":"GEODE-10137-add-jdk17-opt-in","sha":"7201bacc0195f9086aa4eaebcbb8c3a03cb666d5","user":{"login":"onichols-pivotal","id":34043438,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDQzNDM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34043438?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal","html_url":"https://github.com/onichols-pivotal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":114800905,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTQ4MDA5MDU=","name":"geode","full_name":"onichols-pivotal/geode","private":false,"owner":{"login":"onichols-pivotal","id":34043438,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDQzNDM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34043438?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal","html_url":"https://github.com/onichols-pivotal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/received_e

PR introduces a new external API interface: HeapUsageProvider.\r\nUsers can create a class that implements the HeapUsageProvider and configure it as a standard Java service (see java.util.ServiceLoader).\r\nThe ResourceManager will use the HeapUsageProvider to enforce it's eviction-threshold and critical-threshold.\r\nThe HeapUsageProvider provides geode with two pieces of information:\r\n1. what is the maximum amount of heap memory\r\n2. what is the current amount of heap memory being used\r\n\r\nThe HeapUsageProvider must return a reasonable value when getMaxMemory and getBytesUsed are called. It can also optionally implement notifications that it sends to a listener when it detects a change in used memory.\r\n\r\nGeode will look for a service that implements HeapUsageProvider during Cache creation. If it finds one and it throws an exception during construction then this will cause the geode Cache to fail its initialization with the thrown exception. If it does not find one then it will use its own default implementation: MemoryPoolMXBeanHeapUsageProvider. This provider works the same as previous releases of geode.\r\n\r\n<!-- Thank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- In order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken: \r\n-->\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

changes:\r\n - Rather than a value that updates once per second, instantaneous\r\n operations per second and instantaneous kilobytes read per second now\r\n return a rolling average of those stats updated 16 times per second\r\n - Change instantaneous operations per second type from double to int,\r\n since it's always a whole number\r\n - Introduce RollingAverageStat nested class in RedisStats to handle\r\n calculating the rolling average value of a given stat\r\n\r\nTest changes:\r\n - Rename AbstractRedisInfoStatsIntegrationTest to match child classes\r\n - Rather than measuring instantaneous per second stats after\r\n operations have finished, sample them while operations are ongoing\r\n - Assert only that the stats have updated, not that they are close to a\r\n calculated

implements a version of the Redis LREM command, which is used for\r\nlist data types. Associated tests were also added.\r\n\r\nFor a list stored at a key, lrem removes the first given count\r\noccurrences equal to the element specified. A positive count starts at\r\nthe head, while a negative count starts at the tail. If the count is 0,\r\nit removes all occurrences of the element. It returns the amount of\r\nelements actually removed.\r\n\r\nApplyRemoveElementsByIndex delta was modified to remove elements in one\r\niteration. A new delta was added to remove elements in one iteration\r\nstarting from the tail.\r\n\r\nAbstractRedisData equals method was modified to fix the comparison of the expiration timestamp.\r\n\r\n<!-- Thank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- In order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken: \r\n-->\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

commit adds a simple eventing framework to be used by blocking\r\ncommands as well as keyspace event notification (still to be\r\nimplemented). The main components are:\r\n\r\n- EventListener: an interface to be immplemented by anything wishing to\r\n  receive events. Currently only implemented for blocking commands in\r\n  the form of BlockingCommandListener.\r\n- EventDistributor: the component to which listeners are registered and\r\n  where events are received and distributed. A single EventDistributor\r\n  exists in the system and is associated with each\r\n  ExecutionHandlerContext.\r\n- Event: not implemented as a separate class but logically consists of\r\n  the command (RedisCommandType) and key (RedisKey).\r\n\r\nWhen a blocking command receives a relevant event the command is\r\nresubmitted into the Netty pipeline. This also means that something\r\ncould happen (another command) that causes the blocking command to\r\nre-block and not complete. This is also what happens with native Redis.\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n- `BLPOP 0 A` executes and blocks\r\n- `LPUSH A some-value`\r\n- Before LPUSH fires an event, `LPOP A` is received but needs to wait to\r\n  acquire the lock on A\r\n- LPUSH fires an event which the BLPOP listener receives and resubmits\r\n  BLPOP into the pipeline\r\n- Once LPUSH completes, LPOP is next and removes A\r\n- BLPOP A runs and ends up blocking again because there is nothing to\r\n  pop from A\r\n<!-- Thank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- In order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken: \r\n-->\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?
