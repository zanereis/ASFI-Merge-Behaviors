The reason I am doing this is because, the log feature is closing ready.\r\nYou can see the progress from https://github.com/apache/skywalking/issues/5930, we are waiting for the last piece from UI side only, we have gRPC reporter for log4j/log4j2/logback, w/ or w/o Satellite, and OAP backend supports.\r\n\r\nYou also could see from https://github.com/apache/skywalking-rocketbot-ui/pull/420, @Fine0830 is supporting the log-trace collaboration in the UI too.\r\n\r\nAs this new implementation doesn't require to wait for the segment finish signal, it will cost less memory, and local Satellite could provide file cache mechanism(@EvanLjp leads that project). We should recommend users to take the latest and more powerful solution.\r\n\r\nAt last, I am sorry we are removing an accepted contribution which is never released. If you object, please let us

like:\r\n<pre>\r\nexp: node_cpu_seconds_total.sum(['node_identifier_host_name']) - node_cpu_seconds_total.tagEqual('mode', 'idle').sum(['node_identifier_host_name'])\r\n</pre>\r\nThen caused `IllegalArgumentException` in `Analyzer.analyse`.\r\n Because there 2 same sample name in the list of `ExpressionParsingContext.samples`:\r\n<pre>\r\n[0]'node_cpu_seconds_total' \r\n[1]'node_cpu_seconds_total'\r\n</pre>\r\nWhen in `Analyzer.analyse` try to buid `ImmutableMap` caused `IllegalArgumentException`:\r\n<pre>ImmutableMap<String, SampleFamily> input = samples.stream().map(s -> Tuple.of(s, sampleFamilies.get(s)))\r\n            .filter(t -> t._2 != null).collect(ImmutableMap.toImmutableMap(t -> t._1, t -> t._2));</pre>\r\n### How to fix:\r\nAdd codes in `Expression.empower`, add the metricName to `ExpressionParsingContext.samples` only if it doesn't contained.","created_at":"2021-01-25T02:36:09Z","updated_at":"2021-02-01T08:31:55Z","closed_at":"2021-01-25T04:56:06Z","merged_at":"2021-01-25T04:56:06Z","merge_commit_sha":"c52aa02341e1dd7efafddbfceb4434aa0006e6d8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"wu-sheng","id":5441976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDE5NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5441976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng","html_url":"https://github.com/wu-sheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wu-sheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":283421094,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyODM0MjEwOTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true,"description":"Something
