What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to partially revert the commit https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/51a6ba0181a013f2b62b47184785a8b6f6a78f12, and provide a legacy parser based on `FastDateFormat` which is compatible to `SimpleDateFormat`.\r\n\r\nTo enable the legacy parser, set `spark.sql.legacy.timeParser.enabled` to `true`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo allow users to restore old behavior in parsing timestamps/dates using `SimpleDateFormat` patterns. The main reason for restoring is `DateTimeFormatter`'s patterns are not fully compatible to `SimpleDateFormat` patterns, see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-30668\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Added new test to `DateFunctionsSuite`\r\n- Restored additional test cases in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhen I running the `window_part2.sql` tests find it lack insert sql.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR add R API for invoking following higher functions:\r\n\r\n- `transform` -> `array_transform` (to avoid conflict with `base::transform`).\r\n- `exists` -> `array_exists` (to avoid conflict with `base::exists`).\r\n- `forall` -> `array_forall` (no conflicts, renamed for consistency)\r\n- `filter` -> `array_filter` (to avoid conflict with `stats::filter`).\r\n- `aggregate` -> `array_aggregate` (to avoid conflict with `stats::transform`).\r\n- `zip_with` -> `arrays_zip_with` (no conflicts, renamed for consistency)\r\n- `transform_keys`\r\n- `transform_values`\r\n- `map_filter`\r\n- `map_zip_with`\r\n\r\nOverall implementation follows the same pattern as proposed for PySpark (#27406) and reuses object supporting Scala implementation (SPARK-27297).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently higher order functions are available only using SQL and Scala API and can use only SQL expressions:\r\n\r\n```r\r\nselect(df, expr(\"transform(xs, x -> x + 1)\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is error-prone, and hard to do right, when complex logic is used (`when` / `otherwise`, complex objects).\r\n\r\nIf this PR is accepted, above function could be simply rewritten as:\r\n\r\n```r\r\nselect(df, transform(\"xs\", function(x) x + 1))\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo (but new user-facing functions are added).\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded new unit tests.","created_at":"2020-02-02T07:13:31Z","updated_at":"2020-02-28T10:53:22Z","closed_at":"2020-02-28T03:59:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d768b4ebb47c1b7ffa8589dfacc719daceeff5c1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406606336,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA2MzM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARKR","name":"SPARKR","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27433/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27433/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27433/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/23f2c0081e7364e96f42369ca2343497a00fa68e","head":{"label":"zero323:SPARK-30682","ref":"SPARK-30682","sha":"23f2c0081e7364e96f42369ca2343497a00fa68e","user":{"login":"zero323","id":1554276,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTQyNzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1554276?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323","html_url":"https://github.com/zero323","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":43824676,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MzgyNDY3Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"zero323/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zero323","id":1554276,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTQyNzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1554276?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323","html_url":"https://github.com/zero323","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zero323/spark","description":"Mirror

Consider `OFFSET` as the special case of `LIMIT`. For example:\r\n`SELECT * FROM a limit 10;` similar to `SELECT * FROM a limit 10 offset 0;`\r\n`SELECT * FROM a offset 10;` similar to `SELECT * FROM a limit -1 offset 10;`\r\n**2**. Because the current implement of `LIMIT` has good performance. For example:\r\n`SELECT * FROM a limit 10;` parsed to the logic plan as below:\r\n```\r\nGlobalLimit (limit = 10)\r\n|--LocalLimit (limit = 10)\r\n```\r\nand then the physical plan as below:\r\n```\r\nGlobalLimitExec (limit = 10) // Take the first 10 rows globally\r\n|--LocalLimitExec (limit = 10) // Take the first 10 rows locally\r\n```\r\nThis operator reduce massive shuffle and has good performance.\r\nSometimes, the logic plan transformed to the physical plan as:\r\n```\r\nCollectLimitExec (limit = 10) // Take the first 10 rows globally\r\n```\r\nIf the SQL contains order by, such as `SELECT * FROM a order by c limit 10;`.\r\nThis SQL will be transformed to the physical plan as below:\r\n```\r\nTakeOrderedAndProjectExec (limit = 10) // Take the first 10 rows after sort globally\r\n```\r\n\r\nBased on this situation, this PR produces the following operations. For example:\r\n`SELECT * FROM a limit 10 offset 10;` parsed to the logic plan as below:\r\n```\r\nGlobalLimit (limit = 10)\r\n|--LocalLimit (limit = 10)\r\n   |--Offset (offset = 10)\r\n```\r\nAfter optimization, the above logic plan will be transformed to:\r\n```\r\nGlobalLimitAndOffset (limit = 10, offset = 10) // Limit clause accompanied by offset clause\r\n|--LocalLimit (limit = 20)   // 10 + offset = 20\r\n```\r\n\r\nand then the physical plan as below:\r\n```\r\nGlobalLimitAndOffsetExec (limit = 10, offset = 10) // Skip the first 10 rows and take the next 10 rows globally\r\n|--LocalLimitExec (limit = 20) // Take the first 20(limit + offset) rows locally\r\n```\r\nSometimes, the logic plan transformed to the physical plan as:\r\n```\r\nCollectLimitExec (limit = 10, offset = 10) // Skip the first 10 rows and take the next 10 rows globally\r\n```\r\nIf the SQL contains order by, such as `SELECT * FROM a order by c limit 10 offset 10;`.\r\nThis SQL will be transformed to the physical plan as below:\r\n```\r\nTakeOrderedAndProjectExec (limit = 10, offset 10) // Skip the first 10 rows and take the next 10 rows after sort globally\r\n```\r\n**3**.In addition to the above, there is a special case that is only offset but no limit. For example:\r\n`SELECT * FROM a offset 10;` parsed to the logic plan as below:\r\n```\r\nOffset (offset = 10) // Only offset clause\r\n```\r\nIf offset is very large, will generate a lot of overhead. So this PR will refuse use offset clause without limit clause, although we can parse, transform and execute it.\r\n\r\nA balanced idea is add a configuration item `spark.sql.forceUsingOffsetWithoutLimit` to force running query when user knows the offset is small enough. The default value of `spark.sql.forceUsingOffsetWithoutLimit` is false. This PR just came up with the idea so that it could be implemented at a better time in the future.\r\n\r\nNote: The origin PR to support this feature is https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/25416.\r\nBecause the origin PR too old, there exists massive conflict which is hard to resolve.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR is related to https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/26656.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/26656 only support use FILTER clause on aggregate expression without DISTINCT.\r\nThis PR will enhance this feature when one or more DISTINCT aggregate expressions which allows the use of the FILTER clause.\r\nSuch as:\r\n```\r\nselect sum(distinct id) filter (where sex = 'man') from student;\r\nselect class_id, sum(distinct id) filter (where sex = 'man') from student group by class_id;\r\nselect count(id) filter (where class_id = 1), sum(distinct id) filter (where sex = 'man') from student;\r\nselect class_id, count(id) filter (where class_id = 1), sum(distinct id) filter (where sex = 'man') from student group by class_id;\r\nselect sum(distinct id), sum(distinct id) filter (where sex = 'man') from student;\r\nselect class_id, sum(distinct id), sum(distinct id) filter (where sex = 'man') from student group by class_id;\r\nselect class_id, count(id), count(id) filter (where class_id = 1), sum(distinct id), sum(distinct id) filter (where sex = 'man') from student group by class_id;\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Note:**\r\nIn https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/26656, we use `AggregationIterator` to treat the filter conditions of aggregate expr. This is good because we can evaluate filter in first aggregate locally.\r\nIf we use `AggregationIterator` too, the filter conditions of DISTINCT aggregate expr will be treated in second or thrid aggregate.\r\nIn order to reduce cost, we treat the filter conditions of DISTINCT aggregate expr in first aggregate or local is better.\r\nSo, this PR uses `Expand` to ensure the evaluation at local.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSpark SQL only support use FILTER clause on aggregate expression without DISTINCT.\r\nThis PR support Filter expression allows simultaneous use of

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to increase the timeout of `StreamingLogisticRegressionWithSGDTests.test_parameter_accuracy` from 30s (default) to 60s. \r\n\r\nIn this PR, before increasing the timeout,\r\n1. I verified that this is not a JDK11 environmental issue by repeating 3 times first.\r\n2. I reproduced the accuracy failure by reducing the timeout in Jenkins (https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/27424#issuecomment-580981262)\r\n\r\nThen, the final commit passed the Jenkins.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis seems to happen when Jenkins environment has congestion and the jobs are slowdown. The streaming job seems to be unable to repeat the designed iteration `numIteration=25` in 30 seconds. Since the error is decreasing at each iteration, the failure occurs.\r\n\r\nBy reducing the timeout, we can reproduce the similar issue locally like Jenkins.\r\n```python\r\n- eventually(condition, catch_assertions=True)\r\n+ eventually(condition, timeout=10.0, catch_assertions=True)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ python/run-tests --testname 'pyspark.mllib.tests.test_streaming_algorithms

issue depending on the Jenkins job situation, it's difficult to reproduce there.","created_at":"2020-02-01T00:45:43Z","updated_at":"2020-02-01T06:48:20Z","closed_at":"2020-02-01T06:38:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6b630e95ed4ca16b1892482f644e4c8fdb40d3cd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406590181,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTkwMTgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYSPARK","name":"PYSPARK","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1406606402,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA2NDAy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/TESTS","name":"TESTS","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27424/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27424/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27424/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8c8e06aefb94bd675c1eca1c5b4d4bda3d4797d9","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-TEST","ref":"SPARK-TEST","sha":"8c8e06aefb94bd675c1eca1c5b4d4bda3d4797d9","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"82b4f753a088f229616a935c9f5b698fa303f343","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nLike [SPARK-27637](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/25469), \r\nWhen we fetch data use External Shuffle Service, we use ExternalBlockStoreClient to fetch blocks\r\nfrom External Shuffle Service, in real huge cluster, we always need to offline some bad machine, and remote External Shuffle Service will down and we will can't create TransportClient to connect.\r\nIt will throw IOException, but in current way, we will only retry until run out of retry times. \r\n\r\nI think we should throw this error early like  [SPARK-27637](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/25469)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nOld solution not comprehensive. Throw exception early and reduce unnecessary retry.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNO\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nWIP\r\n","created_at":"2020-01-31T14:11:44Z","updated_at":"2020-04-20T08:13:36Z","closed_at":"2020-04-20T08:13:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7aab8093f7af0ee30a912666a6bfb5bf0bce445e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

credit to @Ngone51, Closes #27306.\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIf `updateBlockInfo` returns false, which means the `BlockManager` will re-register and report all blocks later. So, we may report two times for the same block, which causes `AppStatusListener` to count used memory for two times, too. As a result, the used memory can exceed the total memory.\r\nSo, this PR changes it to not post `SparkListenerBlockUpdated` when `updateBlockInfo` returns false. And, always clean up used memory whenever `AppStatusListener` receives `SparkListenerBlockManagerAdded`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis PR tries to fix negative memory usage in UI (https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3488126/72131225-95e37e00-33b6-11ea-8708-6e5ed328d1ca.png, see #27144 ). Though, I'm not very sure this is the root cause for #27144 since known information is limited here.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd new

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n`DataFrameNaFunctions.drop` doesn't handle duplicate columns even when column names are not specified.\r\n\r\n```Scala\r\nval left = Seq((\"1\", null), (\"3\", \"4\")).toDF(\"col1\", \"col2\")\r\nval right = Seq((\"1\", \"2\"), (\"3\", null)).toDF(\"col1\", \"col2\")\r\nval df = left.join(right, Seq(\"col1\"))\r\ndf.printSchema\r\ndf.na.drop(\"any\").show\r\n```\r\nproduces\r\n```\r\nroot\r\n |-- col1: string (nullable = true)\r\n |-- col2: string (nullable = true)\r\n |-- col2: string (nullable = true)\r\n\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: Reference 'col2' is ambiguous, could be: col2, col2.;\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.package$AttributeSeq.resolve(package.scala:240)\r\n```\r\nThe reason for the above failure is that columns are resolved by name and if there are multiple columns with the same name, it will fail due to ambiguity.\r\n\r\nThis PR updates `DataFrameNaFunctions.drop` such that if the columns to drop are not specified, it will resolve ambiguity gracefully by applying `drop` to all the eligible columns. (Note that if the user specifies the columns, it will still continue to fail due to ambiguity).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIf column names are not specified, `drop` should not fail due to ambiguity since it should still be able to apply `drop` to the eligible columns.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, now all the rows with nulls are dropped in the above example:\r\n```\r\nscala> df.na.drop(\"any\").show\r\n+----+----+----+\r\n|col1|col2|col2|\r\n+----+----+----+\r\n+----+----+----+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdded new unit tests.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2020-01-31T03:42:59Z","updated_at":"2020-01-31T07:03:08Z","closed_at":"2020-01-31T07:02:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d6be3cf289d8e86dac13abfa962fb503cc495758","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27411/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27411/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27411/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7ea21efba5ec3e6d051ce48dbeb89abb0d81123e","head":{"label":"imback82:backport-SPARK-30065","ref":"backport-SPARK-30065","sha":"7ea21efba5ec3e6d051ce48dbeb89abb0d81123e","user":{"login":"imback82","id":12103644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTAzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12103644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82","html_url":"https://github.com/imback82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":190453549,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTA0NTM1NDk=","name":"spark-4","full_name":"imback82/spark-4","private":false,"owner":{"login":"imback82","id":12103644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTAzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12103644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82","html_url":"https://github.com/imback82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/imback82/spark-4","description":"Apache

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis change is to allow custom resource scheduler (GPUs,FPGAs,etc) resource discovery to be more flexible. Users are asking for it to work with hadoop 2.x versions that do not support resource scheduling in YARN and/or also they may not run in an isolated environment.\r\nThis change creates a plugin api that users can write their own resource discovery class that allows a lot more flexibility. The user can chain plugins for different resource types. The user specified plugins execute in the order specified and will fall back to use the discovery script plugin if they don't return information for a particular resource.\r\n\r\nI had to open up a few of the classes to be public and change them to not be case classes and make them developer api in order for the the plugin to get enough information it needs.\r\n\r\nI also relaxed the yarn side so that if yarn isn't configured for resource scheduling we just warn and go on. This helps users that have yarn 3.1 but haven't configured the resource scheduling side on their cluster yet, or aren't running in isolated environment.\r\n\r\nThe user would configured this like:\r\n--conf spark.resources.discovery.plugin=\"org.apache.spark.resource.ResourceDiscoveryFPGAPlugin, org.apache.spark.resource.ResourceDiscoveryGPUPlugin\"\r\n\r\nNote the executor side had to be wrapped with a classloader to make sure we include the user classpath for jars they specified on submission.\r\n\r\nNote this is more flexible because the discovery script has limitations such as spawning it in a separate process. This means if you are trying to allocate resources in that process they might be released when the script returns. Other things are the class makes it more flexible to be able to integrate with existing systems and solutions for assigning resources.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nto more easily use spark resource scheduling with older versions of hadoop or in non-isolated enivronments.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes a plugin api\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnit tests added and manual testing done on yarn and standalone modes.","created_at":"2020-01-31T01:43:46Z","updated_at":"2020-02-01T04:20:58Z","closed_at":"2020-02-01T04:20:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"060196882a36836312a10bc483bfc458b15cff79","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

We can just skip trying compaction when \"merge application listing\" fails.\r\n\r\n* When \"compaction\" throws exception we don't handle it.\r\n\r\nIt's expected to swallow exception, but we don't even log the exception for now.

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n`DataFrameNaFunctions.fill` doesn't handle duplicate columns even when column names are not specified.\r\n\r\n```Scala\r\nval left = Seq((\"1\", null), (\"3\", \"4\")).toDF(\"col1\", \"col2\")\r\nval right = Seq((\"1\", \"2\"), (\"3\", null)).toDF(\"col1\", \"col2\")\r\nval df = left.join(right, Seq(\"col1\"))\r\ndf.printSchema\r\ndf.na.fill(\"hello\").show\r\n```\r\nproduces\r\n```\r\nroot\r\n |-- col1: string (nullable = true)\r\n |-- col2: string (nullable = true)\r\n |-- col2: string (nullable = true)\r\n\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: Reference 'col2' is ambiguous, could be: col2, col2.;\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.package$AttributeSeq.resolve(package.scala:259)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.plans.logical.LogicalPlan.resolveQuoted(LogicalPlan.scala:121)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.Dataset.resolve(Dataset.scala:221)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.Dataset.col(Dataset.scala:1268)\r\n```\r\nThe reason for the above failure is that columns are looked up with `DataSet.col()` which tries to resolve a column by name and if there are multiple columns with the same name, it will fail due to ambiguity.\r\n\r\nThis PR updates `DataFrameNaFunctions.fill` such that if the columns to fill are not specified, it will resolve ambiguity gracefully by applying `fill` to all the eligible columns. (Note that if the user specifies the columns, it will still continue to fail due to ambiguity).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIf column names are not specified, `fill` should not fail due to ambiguity since it should still be able to apply `fill` to the eligible columns.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, now the above example displays the following:\r\n```\r\n+----+-----+-----+\r\n|col1| col2| col2|\r\n+----+-----+-----+\r\n|   1|hello|    2|\r\n|   3|    4|hello|\r\n+----+-----+-----+\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR add Python API for invoking following higher functions:\r\n\r\n- `transform`\r\n- `exists`\r\n- `forall`\r\n- `filter`\r\n- `aggregate`\r\n- `zip_with`\r\n- `transform_keys`\r\n- `transform_values`\r\n- `map_filter`\r\n- `map_zip_with`\r\n\r\nto `pyspark.sql`. Each of these accepts plain Python functions of one of the following types\r\n\r\n- `(Column) -> Column: ...`\r\n- `(Column, Column) -> Column: ...`\r\n- `(Column, Column, Column) -> Column: ...`\r\n\r\nInternally this proposal piggbacks on objects supporting Scala implementation ([SPARK-27297](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-27297)) by:\r\n\r\n1. Creating  required `UnresolvedNamedLambdaVariables`  exposing these as PySpark `Columns`\r\n2. Invoking Python function with these columns as arguments.\r\n3. Using the result, and underlying JVM objects from 1., to create `expressions.LambdaFunction` which is passed to desired expression, and repacked as Python `Column`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently higher order functions are available only using SQL and Scala API and can use only SQL expressions\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndf.selectExpr(\"transform(values, x -> x + 1)\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis works reasonably well for simple functions, but can get really ugly with complex functions (complex functions, casts), resulting objects are somewhat verbose and we don't get any IDE support.  Additionally DSL used, though  very simple, is not documented.\r\n\r\nWith changes propose here, above query could be rewritten as:\r\n\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndf.select(transform(\"values\", lambda x: x + 1))\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- For positive cases this PR adds doctest strings covering possible usage patterns.\r\n- For negative cases (unsupported function types) this PR adds unit tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nIf approved, the same approach can be used in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to replace deprecated method `computeCost` of `BisectingKMeansModel` by `summary.trainingCost`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe changes eliminate deprecation warnings:\r\n```\r\nBisectingKMeansSuite.scala:108: method computeCost in class BisectingKMeansModel is deprecated (since 3.0.0): This method is deprecated and will be removed in future versions. Use ClusteringEvaluator instead. You can also get the cost on the training dataset in the summary.\r\n[warn]     assert(model.computeCost(dataset) < 0.1)\r\nBisectingKMeansSuite.scala:135: method computeCost in class BisectingKMeansModel is deprecated (since 3.0.0): This method is deprecated and will be removed in future versions. Use ClusteringEvaluator instead. You can also get the cost on the training dataset in the summary.\r\n[warn]     assert(model.computeCost(dataset) == summary.trainingCost)\r\nBisectingKMeansSuite.scala:323: method computeCost in class BisectingKMeansModel is deprecated (since 3.0.0): This method is deprecated and will be removed in future versions.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR makes `SparkSession.emptyDataFrame` use an empty local relation instead of an empty RDD. This allows to optimizer to recognize this as an empty relation, and creates the opportunity to do some more aggressive optimizations.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIt allows us to optimize empty dataframes better.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded a test case to

documents a new feature `Eventlog Compaction` into the new section of `monitoring.md`, as it only has one configuration on the SHS side and it's hard to explain everything on the description on the

This PR will explain it.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nBuilt docs via jekyll.\r\n\r\n> change on the new

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe `allGather` method is added to the `BarrierTaskContext`. This method contains the same functionality as the `BarrierTaskContext.barrier` method; it blocks the task until all tasks make the call, at which time they may continue execution. In addition, the `allGather` method takes an input message. Upon returning from the `allGather` the task receives a list of all the messages sent by all the tasks that made the `allGather` call.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThere are many situations where having the tasks communicate in a synchronized way is useful. One simple example is if each task needs to start a server to serve requests from one another; first the tasks must find a free port (the result of which is undetermined beforehand) and then start making requests, but to do so they each must know the port chosen by the other task. An `allGather` method would allow them to inform each other of the port they will run on.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, an `BarrierTaskContext.allGather` method will be available through the Scala, Java, and Python APIs.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nMost of the code path is already covered by tests to the `barrier` method, since this PR includes a refactor so that much code is shared by the `barrier` and `allGather` methods. However, a test is added to assert that an all gather on each tasks partition ID will return a list of every partition ID.\r\n\r\nAn example through the Python API:\r\n```python\r\n>>> from pyspark import BarrierTaskContext\r\n>>>\r\n>>> def f(iterator):\r\n...     context = BarrierTaskContext.get()\r\n...     return [context.allGather('{}'.format(context.partitionId()))]\r\n...\r\n>>> sc.parallelize(range(4), 4).barrier().mapPartitions(f).collect()[0]\r\n[u'3', u'1', u'0', u'2']\r\n```\r\n","created_at":"2020-01-30T06:39:42Z","updated_at":"2020-02-20T01:10:07Z","closed_at":"2020-02-19T20:11:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0345d4108437f82c6527ff9f211b49ac5e712067","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch makes the test cases in HiveShowCreateTableSuite create Hive table instead of data source table.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nBecause SparkSQL now creates data source table if no provider is specified in SQL command, some test cases in HiveShowCreateTableSuite don't create Hive table, but data source table.\r\n\r\nIt is confusing and not good for the purpose of this test suite.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo, only test case.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nRoot Cause:\r\nWhen a dataframe is created using select statement (using spark.sql.parser.quotedRegexColumnNames=true) dataframe fill is called- the fillCol in DataFrameNaFunctions, ``(backtick) are added explicitly to the columnNames, the column name is misunderstood to be a regex and it is set as an unresolvedregex, which makes the coalesce resolving to fail.\r\n\r\nObservation\r\nWhen we create the dataframe from the select statement using a regex, valid columns names are returned after applying the filter(regex). So adding backticks to column name in this flow was not needed. To check the impact, select statement with regex were used, there was no impact while executing without the backticks.\r\n\r\nAfter Fix\r\nWhile passing the columnname to the dataframe column method, ``(backtick) are not added, as the value that is received is not a regular expression, but a valid column name.\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nBy doing this change column name is not considered as regex and the proper Column function is \r\nAnd does not fail to resolve the expression.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR fixes the issue where queries with qualified columns like `SELECT t.a FROM t` would fail to resolve for v2 tables.\r\n\r\nThis PR would allow qualified column names in query as following:\r\n```SQL\r\nSELECT testcat.ns1.ns2.tbl.foo FROM testcat.ns1.ns2.tbl\r\nSELECT ns1.ns2.tbl.foo FROM testcat.ns1.ns2.tbl\r\nSELECT ns2.tbl.foo FROM testcat.ns1.ns2.tbl\r\nSELECT tbl.foo FROM testcat.ns1.ns2.tbl\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a bug because you cannot qualify column names in queries.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, now users can qualify column names for v2 tables.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nMake ALS/MLP extend ```HasBlockSize```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently, MLP has its own ```blockSize``` param, we should make MLP extend ```HasBlockSize``` since ```HasBlockSize``` was added in ```sharedParams.scala``` recently.\r\n\r\nALS doesn't have ```blockSize``` param now, we can make it extend ```HasBlockSize```, so user can specify the ```blockSize```.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes\r\n```ALS.setBlockSize``` and ```ALS.getBlockSize```\r\n```ALSModel.setBlockSize``` and ```ALSModel.getBlockSize```\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManually tested. Also added doctest.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2020-01-30T00:08:50Z","updated_at":"2020-01-30T19:30:26Z","closed_at":"2020-01-30T19:13:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bf3ea615140e892f5be7619807f9f42024fc4cdc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27389/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27389/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27389/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d5711e59588b3e7ff04accaece6808a976c8ef11","head":{"label":"huaxingao:spark-30662","ref":"spark-30662","sha":"d5711e59588b3e7ff04accaece6808a976c8ef11","user":{"login":"huaxingao","id":13592258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTkyMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13592258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao","html_url":"https://github.com/huaxingao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":50813048,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MDgxMzA0OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"huaxingao/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"huaxingao","id":13592258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTkyMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13592258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao","html_url":"https://github.com/huaxingao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huaxingao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/huaxingao/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n- Add `minPartitions` support for Kafka Streaming V1 source.\r\n- Add `minPartitions` support for Kafka batch V1  and V2 source.\r\n- There is lots of refactoring (moving codes to KafkaOffsetReader) to reuse codes.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nRight now, the \"minPartitions\" option only works in Kafka streaming source v2. It would be great that we can support it in batch and streaming source v1 (v1 is the fallback mode when a user hits a regression in v2) as well.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYep. The `minPartitions` options is supported in Kafka batch and streaming queries for both data source V1 and V2.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit tests are added to test \"minPartitions\".\r\n","created_at":"2020-01-29T23:56:50Z","updated_at":"2020-01-31T02:17:12Z","closed_at":"2020-01-31T02:15:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"05cd15421e413092b7f0c29e676249a94d507141","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR scopes `SparkSession.active` to prevent problems with processing queries with possibly different spark sessions (and different configs). A new method, `withActive` is introduced on `SparkSession` that restores the previous spark session after the block of code is executed. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n`SparkSession.active` is a thread local variable that points to the current thread's spark session. It is important to note that the `SQLConf.get` method depends on `SparkSession.active`. In the current implementation it is possible that `SparkSession.active` points to a different session which causes various problems. Most of these problems arise because part of the query processing is done using the configurations of a different session. For example, when creating a data frame using a new session, i.e., `session.sql(\"...\")`, part of the data frame is constructed using the currently active spark session, which can be a different session from the one used later for processing the query.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nThe `withActive` method is introduced on `SparkSession`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests (to be added)\r\n","created_at":"2020-01-29T22:49:12Z","updated_at":"2020-02-13T22:59:21Z","closed_at":"2020-02-13T22:59:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d1166592986da4f64425800552eb37f6b1221c08","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27387/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27387/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27387/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7f6274d1605aaef56e2cf978d9d0db927e6386b6","head":{"label":"dbaliafroozeh:UseWithActiveSessionInQueryExecution","ref":"UseWithActiveSessionInQueryExecution","sha":"7f6274d1605aaef56e2cf978d9d0db927e6386b6","user":{"login":"dbaliafroozeh","id":50329522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMzI5NTIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50329522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaliafroozeh","html_url":"https://github.com/dbaliafroozeh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaliafroozeh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaliafroozeh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaliafroozeh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaliafroozeh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaliafroozeh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaliafroozeh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaliafroozeh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaliafroozeh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaliafroozeh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":200818224,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDA4MTgyMjQ=","name":"spark","full_name":"dbaliafroozeh/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dbaliafroozeh","id":50329522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMzI5NTIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50329522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaliafroozeh","html_url":"https://github.com/dbaliafroozeh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaliafroozeh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaliafroozeh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaliafroozeh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaliafroozeh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaliafroozeh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaliafroozeh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaliafroozeh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaliafroozeh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbaliafroozeh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dbaliafroozeh/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIf the resource discovery goes bad, like it doesn't return enough GPUs,  currently it just throws an exception. This is hard for users to see because you have to go find the executor logs and its not reported back to the driver.  On yarn if you exit explicitly then the driver logs show the error thrown and its much more useful.  On yarn with the explicit exit with non-zero it also goes against failed executor launch attempts and the application will eventually exit. so if its fundamentally a bad configuration or bad discovery script it won't just hang forever.   I also tested on k8s and standalone and the behaviors there don't change, the executor cleanly exit with an error message in the logs. The standalone ui makes it easy to see failed executors.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nbetter user experience.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nno api changes\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nran unit tests and manually tested on yarn, standalone, and

During debugging it wasn't obvious why the Worker process would DEAD (until we set SPARK_NO_DAEMONIZE=1) due to the shell-scripts puts the process into background and essentially absorbs the exit code.\r\n3) Added SparkUncaughtExceptionHandlerSuite.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWe propose to add a new interface `SupportsAdmissionControl` and `ReadLimit`. A ReadLimit defines how much data should be read in the next micro-batch. `SupportsAdmissionControl` specifies that a source can rate limit its ingest into the system. The source can tell the system what the user specified as a read limit, and the system can enforce this limit within each micro-batch or impose its own limit if the Trigger is Trigger.Once() for example.\r\n\r\nWe then use this interface in FileStreamSource, KafkaSource, and KafkaMicroBatchStream.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSources currently have no information around execution semantics such as whether the stream is being executed in Trigger.Once() mode. This interface will pass this information into the sources as part of planning. With a trigger like Trigger.Once(), the semantics are to process all the data available to the datasource in a single micro-batch. However, this semantic can be broken when data source options such as `maxOffsetsPerTrigger` (in the Kafka source) rate limit the amount of data read for that micro-batch without this interface.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nDataSource developers can extend this interface for their streaming sources to add admission control into their system and correctly support Trigger.Once().\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests, as this API is mostly internal\r\n","created_at":"2020-01-29T02:23:42Z","updated_at":"2021-07-20T09:37:51Z","closed_at":"2020-01-31T06:03:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b1c534c57627c2f4c63b901f552404220dce175f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1. Adds a InMemoryRelation node and its cachedPlan as a child node of InMemoryTableScan ([SPARK-29431](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-29431)).\r\n2. De-duplicate identical subplans shared by InMemoryTableScan operators within the same query ([SPARK-30367](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-30367)).\r\n3. Add computed rows metric to InMemoryRelation operators ([SPARK-30368](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-30368)).\r\n4. Prune the cached subplan if it was not actually computed ([SPARK-30369](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-30369)).\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, if a user caches a dataframe as part of the query, it introduces an InMemoryTableScan operator into the query plan when the cached data is read again. The InMemoryTableScan operator does not have child operators and thus doesn't show the subplan of the query that is run before caching the dataframe.\r\n\r\nHowever, simply showing the subplan as a child of InMemoryTableScan can lead to some confusion for the user. It is possible for the cached dataframe to be read multiple times within the query, which will cause multiple InMemoryTableScan operators to be shown within the plan and thus cause the subplan to be shown multiple times across the query plan even though it is computed only once. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, it is possible for the cached dataframe to be read in another query. This will cause the subplan to be shown in a query it was not actually computed in, which is misleading, so we should remove it in this case. However, It is also possible for the dataframe to be partially cached, meaning some partitions are cached whereas some need to be recomputed. In this case, we should still show the subplan in the query as it is will still be computed for some partitions of the dataframe. A \"num computed rows\" metric is added to InMemoryRelation (the child node of InMemoryTableScan which has the subplan as its child) to make it more clear when only some partitions of the cached data are recomputed.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, in the SQL tab of the WebUI. See the JIRA for examples of the WebUI with and without the changes.\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n* Added unit tests in SparkPlanInfoSuite, CachedRDDBuilderSuite, SparkPlanGraphSuite, SparkPlanGraphUpdaterSuite, and SparkPlanGraphNodeTransformersSuite.\r\n* Integration tests using the spark shell to show the desired behavior change in the UI is achieved.\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR introduces a reliable accumulator which only merges the first accumulator from each partition. Together with `AccumulatorMetadata.countFailedValues == false`, this makes accumulator values reliable in the presence of reprocessing partitions.\r\n\r\nThe current implementation has no means to identify which partition a remote accumulator value is merged from. When partitions are executed multiple times (e.g. re-run on failure or cache eviction, rerunning actions, usage of a stage in multiple actions), accumulators currently consider all partitions' accumulator values.\r\n\r\nThe `ReliableAccumulator` keeps the first accumulator per partition only. For accumulators registered with `countFailedValues == false`, this provides the accumulator value equivalent to a single successful stage, which does not change any more.\r\n\r\nThe reliable accumulator on the driver uses additional memory in the order of the number of partitions.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWith the current behaviour, only a very limited class of accumulator use cases can be implemented, those that count across partition executions. Counting read and written bytes is a good example where this behaviour is desired. Counting the number of rows of the dataset, or rows that meet a certain condition cannot be implemented with this behaviour. The accumulator over-counts and thus only provides a pessimistic upper bound of the true value. With this PR, exact reliable numbers can be extracted.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, it introduces the method `ReliableAccumulator.merge(AccumulatorV2, int)` that is called by DAGScheduler to provide the partition id.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests in the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR removes any dependencies on pypandoc. It also makes related tweaks to the docs README to clarify the dependency on pandoc (not pypandoc).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWe are using pypandoc to convert the Spark README from Markdown to ReST for PyPI. PyPI now natively supports Markdown, so we don't need pypandoc anymore. The dependency on pypandoc also sometimes causes issues when installing Python packages that depend on PySpark, as described in #18981.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\npython -m venv venv\r\nsource venv/bin/activate\r\npip install -U pip\r\n\r\ncd python/\r\npython setup.py sdist\r\npip install dist/pyspark-3.0.0.dev0.tar.gz \r\npyspark --version\r\n```\r\n\r\nI also built the PySpark and R API docs with `jekyll` and reviewed them locally.\r\n\r\nIt would be good if a maintainer could also test this by creating a PySpark distribution and uploading it to [Test PyPI](https://test.pypi.org) to confirm the README looks as it

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdding more metrics to the all-stages page, some of those available at the individual stages pages, namely `Peak Execution Memory`, `Spill (Memory)`, `Spill (Disk)` and `GC Time`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFinding stages that perform poorly is difficult when you have hundreds or thousands of stages. Sorting all stages by those extra metrics helps to identify those stages.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, in the Web UI, not in the API.\r\n![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44700269/73278310-b2234f80-41eb-11ea-8f38-ff6bda893678.png)\r\n![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44700269/73278326-b8b1c700-41eb-11ea-8c09-714a18642691.png)\r\n\r\n###

If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR solves two bugs related to streaming limits\r\n\r\n**Bug 1 (SPARK-30658)**: Limit before a streaming aggregate (i.e. `df.limit(5).groupBy().count()`) in complete mode was not being planned as a stateful streaming limit. The planner rule planned a logical limit with a stateful streaming limit plan only if the query is in append mode. As a result, instead of allowing max 5 rows across batches, the planned streaming query was allowing 5 rows in every batch thus producing incorrect results.\r\n\r\n**Solution**: Change the planner rule to plan the logical limit with a streaming limit plan even when the query is in complete mode if the logical limit has no stateful operator before it.\r\n\r\n**Bug 2 (SPARK-30657)**: `LocalLimitExec` does not consume the iterator of the child plan. So if there is a limit after a stateful operator like streaming dedup in append mode (e.g. `df.dropDuplicates().limit(5)`), the state changes of streaming duplicate may not be committed (most stateful ops commit state changes only after the generated iterator is fully consumed).\r\n\r\n**Solution**: Change the planner rule to always use a new `StreamingLocalLimitExec` which always fully consumes the iterator. This is the safest thing to do. However, this will introduce a performance regression as consuming the iterator is extra work. To minimize this performance impact, add an additional post-planner optimization rule to replace `StreamingLocalLimitExec` with `LocalLimitExec` when there is no stateful operator before the limit that could be affected by it.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUpdated incorrect unit tests and added new ones","created_at":"2020-01-28T09:27:29Z","updated_at":"2020-01-31T22:10:37Z","closed_at":"2020-01-31T17:35:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c14c21e896ef94b7006864f724b8d02ea218791b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSpark's Web UI is using an older version of Bootstrap (v. 2.3.2) for the portal pages. Bootstrap 2.x was moved to EOL in Aug 2013 and Bootstrap 3.x was moved to EOL in July 2019 (https://github.com/twbs/release). Older versions of Bootstrap are also getting flagged in security scans for various CVEs:\r\n\r\nhttps://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-BOOTSTRAP-72889\r\nhttps://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-BOOTSTRAP-173700\r\nhttps://snyk.io/vuln/npm:bootstrap:20180529\r\nhttps://snyk.io/vuln/npm:bootstrap:20160627\r\n\r\nI haven't validated each CVE, but it would be nice to resolve any potential issues and get on a supported release.\r\n\r\nThe bad news is that there have been quite a few changes between Bootstrap 2 and Bootstrap 4. I've tried updating the library, refactoring/tweaking the CSS and JS to maintain a similar appearance and functionality, and testing the UI for functionality and appearance. This is a fairly large change so I'm sure additional testing and fixes will be needed.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThis has been manually tested, but there is a ton of functionality and there are many pages and detail pages so it is very possible bugs introduced from the upgrade were missed.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWe are using an older version of Bootstrap (v. 2.1.0) for the online documentation site.  Bootstrap 2.x was moved to EOL in Aug 2013 and Bootstrap 3.x was moved to EOL in July 2019 (https://github.com/twbs/release).  Older versions of Bootstrap are also getting flagged in security scans for various CVEs:\r\n\r\n    https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-BOOTSTRAP-72889\r\n    https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-BOOTSTRAP-173700\r\n    https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:bootstrap:20180529\r\n    https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:bootstrap:20160627\r\n\r\nI haven't validated each CVE, but it would probably be good practice to resolve any potential issues and get on a supported release.\r\n\r\nThe bad news is that there have been quite a few changes between Bootstrap 2 and Bootstrap 4.  I've tried updating the library, refactoring/tweaking the CSS and JS to maintain a similar appearance and functionality, and testing the documentation.  This is a fairly large change so I'm sure additional testing and fixes will be needed.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThis has been manually tested, but as there is a lot of documentation it is possible issues were missed.  Additional testing and feedback is welcomed.  If it appears a whole section was missed let me know and I'll take a pass at addressing that section.","created_at":"2020-01-27T20:06:54Z","updated_at":"2020-08-27T17:48:36Z","closed_at":"2020-08-27T14:03:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"89b3b6cedf212d2e813dcc71caadbf3a0ba768fe","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406627011,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MDEx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCUMENTATION","name":"DOCUMENTATION","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27369/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27369/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27369/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0281f6cda411bdde4dcaf0449ae09fe5f95f66fb","head":{"label":"clarkead:bootstrap4-docs-upgrade","ref":"bootstrap4-docs-upgrade","sha":"0281f6cda411bdde4dcaf0449ae09fe5f95f66fb","user":{"login":"clarkead","id":13144168,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTQ0MTY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13144168?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clarkead","html_url":"https://github.com/clarkead","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clarkead/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clarkead/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clarkead/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clarkead/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clarkead/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clarkead/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clarkead/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clarkead/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clarkead/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":227725321,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjc3MjUzMjE=","name":"spark","full_name":"clarkead/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"clarkead","id":13144168,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTQ0MTY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13144168?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clarkead","html_url":"https://github.com/clarkead","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clarkead/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clarkead/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clarkead/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clarkead/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clarkead/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clarkead/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clarkead/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clarkead/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clarkead/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/clarkead/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently `EXPLAIN FORMATTED` only report input attributes of HashAggregate/ObjectHashAggregate/SortAggregate, while `EXPLAIN EXTENDED` provides more information of Keys, Functions, etc. This PR enhanced `EXPLAIN FORMATTED` to sync with original explain behavior.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe newly added `EXPLAIN FORMATTED` got less information comparing to the original `EXPLAIN EXTENDED`\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, taking HashAggregate explain result as example.\r\n\r\n**SQL**\r\n```\r\nEXPLAIN FORMATTED\r\n  SELECT\r\n    COUNT(val) + SUM(key) as TOTAL,\r\n    COUNT(key) FILTER (WHERE val > 1)\r\n  FROM explain_temp1;\r\n```\r\n\r\n**EXPLAIN

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to support pushed down filters in JSON datasource. The reason of pushing a filter up to `JacksonParser` is to apply the filter as soon as all its attributes become available i.e. converted from JSON field values to desired values according to the schema. This allows to skip parsing of the rest of JSON record and conversions of other values if the filter returns `false`. This can improve performance when pushed filters are highly selective and conversion of JSON string fields to desired values are comparably expensive ( for example, the conversion to `TIMESTAMP` values).\r\n\r\nThe main idea behind of `JsonFilters` is to group pushdown filters by their references, convert the grouped filters to expressions, and then compile to predicates. The predicates are indexed by schema field positions. Each predicate has a state with reference counter to non-set row fields. As soon as the counter reaches `0`, it can be applied to the row because all its dependencies has been set. Before processing new row, predicate's reference counter is reset to total number of predicate references (dependencies in a row).\r\n\r\nThe common code shared between `CSVFilters` and `JsonFilters` is moved to the `StructFilters` class and its companion object.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe changes improve performance on synthetic benchmarks up to **27 times** on JDK 8 and **25** times on JDK 11:\r\n```\r\nOpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM 1.8.0_242-8u242-b08-0ubuntu3~18.04-b08 on Linux 4.15.0-1044-aws\r\nIntel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2670 v2 @ 2.50GHz\r\nFilters pushdown:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch converts CR/LF into LF in 3 source files, which most files are only using LF. This patch also add rules to enforce EOL as LF for all java, scala, xml, py, R files.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe majority of source code files are using LF and only three files are CR/LF. While using IDE would let us don't bother with the difference, it still has a chance to make unnecessary diff if the file is modified with the editor which doesn't handle it automatically.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n```\r\ngrep -IUrl --color \"^M\" . | grep \"\\.java\\|\\.scala\\|\\.xml\\|\\.py\\|\\.R\" | grep -v \"/target/\" | grep -v \"/build/\" | grep -v \"/dist/\" | grep -v \"dependency-reduced-pom.xml\" | grep -v \".pyc\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n(Please note you'll need to type CTRL+V -> CTRL+M in bash shell to get `^M` because it's representing CR/LF, not a combination of `^` and `M`.)\r\n\r\nBefore the patch, the result is:\r\n\r\n```\r\n./sql/core/src/main/java/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/columnar/ColumnDictionary.java\r\n./sql/catalyst/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/optimizer/complexTypesSuite.scala\r\n./sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/optimizer/ComplexTypes.scala\r\n```\r\n\r\nand after the patch, the result is None.\r\n\r\nAnd git shows WARNING message if EOL of any of source files in given types are modified to CR/LF, like below:\r\n\r\n```\r\nwarning: CRLF will be replaced by LF in sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/analysis/Analyzer.scala.\r\nThe file will have its original line endings in your working directory.\r\n```","created_at":"2020-01-26T13:24:22Z","updated_at":"2020-01-27T20:08:05Z","closed_at":"2020-01-27T18:21:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4cfb88618d74f3547457ee202f767ed7d8af4de8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406587336,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PROJECT%20INFRA","name":"PROJECT

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR (SPARK-31394) aims to add a new feature that enables mounting of Kubernetes NFS volumes. Most of the codes are just slight modifications from the existing codes for EmptyDir/HostDir/PVC support.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nKubernetes supports various kinds of volumes, but Spark for Kubernetes supports only EmptyDir/HostDir/PVC. By adding support for NFS, we can use Spark for Kubernetes with NFS storage.\r\n\r\nIn order to use NFS with the current Spark using PVC, the user needs to first create an empty new PVC with NFS. Kubernetes' NFS provisioner will create a new empty dir in NFS under some pre-configured dir for this PVC, for example, `/nfs/k8s/sjcho-my-notebook-pvc-dce84888-7a9d-11e6-b1ee-5254001e0c1b`. Then the user should add files to process in the newly created PVC using some file-copying job, and then run the desired Spark job using that populated PVC. And then to get the final results out, the user should run another file-copying job.\r\n\r\nThis in theory works, but for data analysis tasks, is quite cumbersome. With this change, one could simply use existing files in NFS, say `/nfs/home/sjcho/myfiles@10.sstable` from the Spark job directly, and also write the results directly to some existing dir under NFS such as `/nfs/home/sjcho/output`.\r\n\r\nThis PR doesn't use any features other than the features already provided by Kubernetes itself, so there should be no compatibility issues (other than limited by k8s) between the wide variety of NFS choices. This PR merely enables an existing volume type `nfs` supported officially by Kubernetes, just like Spark is currently supporting `hostPath` and `persistentVolumeClaim` right now.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nUsers can now mount NFS volumes by running commands like:\r\n```\r\nspark-submit \\\r\n--conf spark.kubernetes.driver.volumes.nfs.myshare.mount.path=/myshare \\\r\n--conf spark.kubernetes.driver.volumes.nfs.myshare.mount.readOnly=false \\\r\n--conf spark.kubernetes.driver.volumes.nfs.myshare.options.server=nfs.example.com \\\r\n--conf spark.kubernetes.driver.volumes.nfs.myshare.options.path=/storage/myshare \\\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTest cases were added just like the existing EmptyDir support.\r\n\r\nThe code were tested using minikube using the following script:\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/w4-sjcho/4ba48f8c35a9685f5307fbd46b2c0656#file-run-test-sh\r\n\r\nThe script creates a new minikube cluster, launches an NFS server inside the cluster, copy `README.md` file to the NFS share, and run `JavaWordCount` example against the file located in NFS.","created_at":"2020-01-26T12:10:28Z","updated_at":"2020-04-15T13:13:02Z","closed_at":"2020-04-15T10:46:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b0898da593f736a55783cf8f13f13b4f5de72eec","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605057,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/KUBERNETES","name":"KUBERNETES","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27364/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/27364/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/27364/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f4b3ba52972c4e977fdb21ca9195ef6fad290ba8","head":{"label":"sjincho:master","ref":"master","sha":"f4b3ba52972c4e977fdb21ca9195ef6fad290ba8","user":{"login":"sjincho","id":8187891,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxODc4OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8187891?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjincho","html_url":"https://github.com/sjincho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjincho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjincho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjincho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjincho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjincho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjincho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjincho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjincho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjincho/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":235735269,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzU3MzUyNjk=","name":"spark","full_name":"sjincho/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sjincho","id":8187891,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxODc4OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8187891?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjincho","html_url":"https://github.com/sjincho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjincho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjincho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjincho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjincho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjincho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjincho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjincho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjincho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjincho/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sjincho/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nDisabling test for cleaning closure of recursive function.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAs of https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/9514b822a70d77a6298ece48e6c053200360302c this test is no longer valid, and recursive calls, even simple ones:\r\n\r\n```lead\r\n  f <- function(x) {\r\n    if(x > 0) {\r\n      f(x - 1)\r\n    } else {\r\n      x\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nlead to \r\n\r\n```\r\nError: node stack overflow\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is issue is silenced when tested with `testthat` 1.x (reason unknown), but cause failures when using `testthat` 2.x (issue can be reproduced outside test context).\r\n\r\nProblem is known and tracked by [SPARK-30629](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-30629)\r\n\r\nTherefore, keeping this test active doesn't make sense, as it will lead to continuous test failures, when `testthat` is updated (https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/27359 / SPARK-23435).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nExisting tests.\r\n\r\nCC @falaki

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nPrevent unnecessary copies of data during conversion from Arrow to Pandas.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nDuring conversion of pyarrow data to Pandas, columns are checked for timestamp types and then modified to correct for local timezone. If the data contains no timestamp types, then unnecessary copies of the data can be made. This is most prevalent when checking columns of a pandas DataFrame where each series is assigned back to the DataFrame, regardless if it had timestamps. See https://www.mail-archive.com/dev@arrow.apache.org/msg17008.html and ARROW-7596 for discussion.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to transform the `Like` expression to `TernaryExpression`, and add third parameter `escape`. So, the `like` function will have feature parity with `LIKE ... ESCAPE` syntax supported by https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/187f3c17733f94aa3372caca355ad18ec1198f2f.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe `like` functions can be called with 2 or 3 parameters, and functionally equivalent to `LIKE` and `LIKE ... ESCAPE` SQL expressions.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, before `like` fails with the exception:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> SELECT like('_Apache Spark_', '__%Spark__', '_');\r\nError in query: Invalid number of arguments for function like.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nDeprecate numTrees in GBT in 2.4.5 so it can be removed in 3.0.0\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, GBT has\r\n```\r\n  /**\r\n   * Number of trees in ensemble\r\n   */\r\n  @Since(\"2.0.0\")\r\n  val getNumTrees: Int = trees.length\r\n```\r\nand\r\n```\r\n  /** Number of trees in ensemble */\r\n  val numTrees: Int = trees.length\r\n```\r\nI think we should remove one of them. I will deprecate it in 2.4.5 and remove it in 3.0.0\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nDeprecate numTrees in 2.4.5\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdds an Analyzer rule to normalize the column names used in V2 AlterTable table changes. We need to handle all ColumnChange operations. We add an extra match statement for future proofing new changes that may be added. This prevents downstream consumers (e.g. catalogs) to deal about case sensitivity or check that columns exist, etc.\r\n\r\nWe also fix the behavior for ALTER TABLE CHANGE COLUMN (Hive style syntax) for adding comments to complex data types. Currently, the data type needs to be provided as part of the Hive style syntax. This assumes that the data type as changed when it may have not and the user only wants to add a comment, which fails in CheckAnalysis.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently we do not handle case sensitivity correctly for ALTER TABLE ALTER COLUMN operations.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, fixes a bug.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nIntroduced v2CommandsCaseSensitivitySuite and added a test around HiveStyle Change columns to

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nDisable all the V2 file sources in Spark 3.0 by default.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThere are still some missing parts in the file source V2 framework:\r\n1. It doesn't support reporting file scan metrics such as \"numOutputRows\"/\"numFiles\"/\"fileSize\" like `FileSourceScanExec`. This requires another patch in the data source V2 framework. Tracked by [SPARK-30362](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-30362)\r\n2. It doesn't support partition pruning with subqueries(including dynamic partition pruning) for now. Tracked by [SPARK-30628](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-30628)\r\n\r\nAs we are going to code freeze on Jan 31st, this PR proposes to disable all the V2 file sources in Spark 3.0 by default.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd SPARK_APPLICATION_ID environment when spark configure driver pod. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, driver doesn't have this in environments and it's no convenient to retrieve spark id. \r\nThe use case is we want to look up spark application id and create application folder and redirect driver logs to application folder. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nunit tested. I also build new distribution and container image to kick off a job in Kubernetes and I do see SPARK_APPLICATION_ID added there.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\noverride `Command.stats` to return a dummy statistics (Long.Max).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCommands are eagerly executed. They will be converted to LocalRelation after the DataFrame is created. That said, the statistics of a command is useless. We should avoid unnecessary statistics calculation of command's children.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nnew
