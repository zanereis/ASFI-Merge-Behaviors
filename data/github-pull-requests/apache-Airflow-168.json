Meaning if REST APIs are enabled, the Test Connection button is enabled for _all_ connection types even if a selected type doesn't actually support testing connectivity in this way. This can be confusing for users.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds functionality to dynamically enable (or disable) the Test Connection button based on if the selected connection type supports testing via the Airflow REST API. (Note that if Airflow REST APIs are disabled for an environment, this configuration will take precedence over this logic.) Also, when disabling the button, the element will now be functionally disabled rather than just the appearance of being disabled.\r\n\r\n**Example of dynamically disabled Test Connection button:**\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48934154/143132472-27d9edfe-5726-40b4-8969-e4b828f79b5e.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the

It will get out of this state on its own, but the time taken depends on the runtime of current tasks - this could be several hours or even days.\r\n\r\nIf the scheduler can't queue any tasks because of different concurrency limits (per pool, dag or task), then on next iterations of the scheduler loop it will try to queue the same tasks. Meanwhile there could be some scheduled tasks with lower `priority_weight` that could be queued, but they will remain waiting.\r\n\r\nThe proposed solution is to keep track of dag and task ids, that are concurrecy limited and then repeat the query with these dags and tasks filtered out.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

are two changes here:\r\n1. Let see this case:\r\n\r\n- i use sequential executor, and use sqlite as db\r\n- the dag has two task(as the pic shown below), and there is NO dependeny between them\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4498225/142868986-4294b24f-0cb9-45d8-aef6-e2a0cd97a2da.png)\r\n\r\nThen, whent i start a dag run, both tasks [sleep_1] and [sleep_2] will be added to sequential executor in the same schduler loop.\r\n\r\nWhen i stop the dagrun when the first taskinstance(let's assume the is the [sleep_1] step) is running, using set_dag_run_state_to_failed function from airflow.api.common.experimental.mark_tasks. I can see the state of dagrun and the state of taskinstance of task [sleep_1] will be changed into FAILED, BUT the taskinstance of [sleep_2] will be left unchanged(queued)\r\n\r\nThen, something weired happend, the task instance of [sleep_2] will be executed as usual. That's NOT what i want!\r\n\r\nI check the code, and find the sequential executor will still run all the taskintance in command_to_run list, even if some taskinstance of the same dagrun has already failed.\r\n\r\nAnd, even when running [airflow task run] command, the check_and_change_state_before_execution function in model/taskinstance.py will not check whether the dagrun of the taskinstance has failed or not.\r\n\r\nSo i add the add DagrunRunningDep into RUNNING_DEPS, and things go right again.\r\n\r\n2. models/__init__.py has not import SerializedDagModel serialized_dag.py, so add it. I changed airflow(in site-packages) in my local enviroment, and it works, so I want to open a pull request.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.rst#pull-request-guidelines)** for more information.\r\nIn case of fundamental code change, Airflow Improvement Proposal

current tests for the Docker image are written in bash, which unfortunately makes them limited and difficult to maintain.  They don't always find all the problems they could find if they were written in Python. For example, when we added MSSQL support to the Docker image, we don't update the list of preinstalled packages:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/scripts/ci/libraries/_initialization.sh#L419-L442\r\nWhen a test is written in Python, it is easier to write a valid test because Python supports comparing complex structures like `set == set`.\r\n\r\nThanks to `Pytest-xdist`, the tests can be executed in many threads, which significantly speeds them up. Instead of 3 m 30 sec, it now takes 1 minute on my MacBook Pro. And we don't need any GNU parallels specialist for that. \r\n\r\nIn the future, I would like to rewrite [the tests for image building examples](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/1b89e682a1a04adf2cf5ebb37a453e245a6e7191/scripts/ci/images/ci_test_examples_of_prod_image_building.sh#L1) in a similar way, so that they can be run just as easily. \r\nIn addition, I also hope to contribute [tests for docker-compose files](https://github.com/mik-laj/airflow-docker-compose-examples/blob/main/tests/test_compose_files.py), which are currently being developed in an independent repository, and despite this, they have allowed me to detect various problems many times.\r\n\r\nBut for now, I would like to limit the scope of the change\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.rst#pull-request-guidelines)** for more

#18999 \r\n\r\nThe PR intends to add deferrable versions of `DatabricksSubmitRunOperator` and `DatabricksRunNowOperator`, which are using [new Airflow functionality introduced with the version 2.2.0](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/2.2.0/concepts/deferring.html#deferrable-operators-triggers).\r\n\r\nThere're not so many examples of deferrable operators at the moment, so I'd appreciate if we discuss the following:\r\n- Should we update existing operators or create new?\r\n  If we update existing operators right away, we'll break backward compatibility for Airflow versions prior 2.2.0, so I thought it'd be better to introduce new operators at the moment.\r\n- Execution timeout for deferrable operators not handled correctly at the moment, will investigate separately

is this?\r\nThis is to resolve incomplete solution of this commit https://github.com/apache/airflow/commit/42e13e1a5a4c97a2085ddf96f7d93e7bf71949b8 (#17900)\r\nThe deprecation warning was previously shown always, but with above commit the scope was reduced. Unfortunately, its not doing what its intended to do - show this warning only when legacy Volume and VolumeMount classes are being used with KubernetesPodOperator. Instead, it now shows up always when you use Volume or VolumeMount of ANY implementation (old or new).\r\n\r\nThe reason for that is next:\r\n1. The \"conversion\" methods are called on KPO always whenever there's any Volume/VolumeMount\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/1e570229533c4bbf5d3c901d5db21261fa4b1137/airflow/providers/cncf/kubernetes/operators/kubernetes_pod.py#L246-L247\r\n2. While those methods will convert only if necessary, inside of them we're doing imports of legacy class, which immediately shows message of deprecation upon import, rather than upon validation of underline class (so that we know if we have to import it in the first place...). In other words, we have a chicken-and-egg problem that might have been solved incorrectly.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/1e570229533c4bbf5d3c901d5db21261fa4b1137/airflow/providers/cncf/kubernetes/backcompat/backwards_compat_converters.py#L55-L57\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/1e570229533c4bbf5d3c901d5db21261fa4b1137/airflow/providers/cncf/kubernetes/backcompat/backwards_compat_converters.py#L67-L69\r\n\r\nSo what do we do about it?\r\nOne of the approaches that I decided to take was to inspect the method `_convert_kube_model_object`. To my surprise, it doesn't use old class for anything but basically print of exception in \"catch-all-other-scenarios\" way.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/1e570229533c4bbf5d3c901d5db21261fa4b1137/airflow/providers/cncf/kubernetes/backcompat/backwards_compat_converters.py#L28-L35\r\nThe minimal effort solution is to avoid import of legacy classes in backcompat altogether, while passing just the \"string\" name of those classes. This way the behavior of underline method is not changing, we still get the deprecation warnings when user is trying to import legacy classes separately in his code (while constructing the KPO), but there won't be warning shown during \"processing\" of KPO itself (on scheduler I assume?).\r\n\r\nThe proposed solution is potentially anti-pattern, as we pass literally the wrong type to defined function, but I'm ready to listen for constructive \"better\" solutions that will introduce minimal regressions to existing airflow codebase. That might come with extra overhead of validation of incoming type above the call to `_convert_kube_model_object` or such. In proposed solution should be no such extra overhead.","created_at":"2021-11-20T21:49:52Z","updated_at":"2021-12-16T20:27:47Z","closed_at":"2021-12-16T20:08:13Z","merged_at":"2021-12-16T20:08:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"4b8a1201ae7635e5a751dd079a887831783bb6cb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"dimberman","id":2644098,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NDQwOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2644098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman","html_url":"https://github.com/dimberman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"jedcunningham","id":66968678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2OTY4Njc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66968678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham","html_url":"https://github.com/jedcunningham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1697155831,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjk3MTU1ODMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:providers","name":"area:providers","color":"d4c5f9","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2172803017,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcyODAzMDE3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:bug-fix","name":"type:bug-fix","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog:

is this?\r\nThis PR is to help with consequences of https://github.com/apache/airflow/commit/867e9305f08bf9580f25430d8b6e84071c59f9e6 (#17987)\r\n\r\nCurrently out of the box base_aws implementation is going to show warnings whenever connection cache is invoked (that is potentially always when you use any AWS-based resource in Airflow like S3 as storage for logging or sensors)\r\n\r\nWhy?\r\nNewly added warning for deprecation is shown every time anyone is passing `not None` value `client_type` to `get_client_type` method. Same is happening with `not None` value `resource_type` being passed to `get_resource_type`.\r\nWhile this new deprecation warning might have been created with good intentions, the out of the box calls to mentioned methods weren't modified accordingly (missed during review?), so right now Airflow is barking on its own code for deprecation on any AWS-hook based component.\r\n\r\nCondition 1:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/aa2cb5545f09d694b9143b323efcd4f6b6c66e60/airflow/providers/amazon/aws/hooks/base_aws.py#L444-L449\r\n\r\nCalls:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/aa2cb5545f09d694b9143b323efcd4f6b6c66e60/airflow/providers/amazon/aws/hooks/base_aws.py#L493-L494\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/aa2cb5545f09d694b9143b323efcd4f6b6c66e60/airflow/providers/amazon/aws/hooks/base_aws.py#L541-L542\r\n\r\n(for `iam` call please read the notes on the very end of this PR message)\r\n\r\nCondition 2:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/aa2cb5545f09d694b9143b323efcd4f6b6c66e60/airflow/providers/amazon/aws/hooks/base_aws.py#L469-L474\r\n\r\nCalls:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/aa2cb5545f09d694b9143b323efcd4f6b6c66e60/airflow/providers/amazon/aws/hooks/base_aws.py#L495-L496\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nNow, to mitigate this I took next approach: I pass temporarily None in mentioned arguments until the code is refactored to get rid of entire argument in method (I assume somewhen in the future?).\r\n\r\nFew notes:\r\n1. One piece of code that I randomly noticed is that IAM request is not standard (see call 2 in above mentioned cuts, and is using special hardcoded value \"iam\"). As I'm not certain about all the specifics of Airflow internals I have added \"iam\" to list of exceptions for deprecation for time being. Feel free to modify to proper approach.\r\n2. There might be other invocations of mentioned methods with \"not None\" being passed by Airflow codebase, but unfortunately, I haven't done deep inspection of entire codebase to verify.","created_at":"2021-11-20T21:21:52Z","updated_at":"2021-11-23T20:28:00Z","closed_at":"2021-11-23T19:41:57Z","merged_at":"2021-11-23T19:41:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"4be04143a5f7e246127e942bf1d73abcd22ce189","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1471852032,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDcxODUyMDMy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:amazon","name":"provider:amazon","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"AWS/Amazon

to a previous change (https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/19709) to not load provider hooks too early we can take advantage of the \"preload-app\" feature of Gunicorn to load the application once in the main gunicorn process before the workers are forked off.\n\nThis change makes the webserver start up (time to serving first request) go from 20s to 5s.\n\n(The reason we don't just do this blindly everywhere is that it would mean plugins are loaded at start only, and is a change in behaviour.

fine.)","created_at":"2021-11-19T14:12:51Z","updated_at":"2022-01-22T17:15:45Z","closed_at":"2021-11-19T20:16:47Z","merged_at":"2021-11-19T20:16:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"17d8656a0745a76925a51de6f6e7ce2488d1d2f4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"dstandish","id":15932138,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTMyMTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15932138?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish","html_url":"https://github.com/dstandish","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1769003317,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzY5MDAzMzE3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:dev-tools","name":"area:dev-tools","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2057471696,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDU3NDcxNjk2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/changelog:skip","name":"changelog:skip","color":"a8f731","default":false,"description":"Changes

drops the time to first request from 37s to 20s by making the\r\nfollowing changes:\r\n\r\n- Don't pre-load the app when not in daemon mode.\r\n\r\n  The purpose of the call to `cached_app()` was to ensure that any\r\n  errors are reported on the terminal before it is detached to make\r\n  failures more obvious to the user (which is a good feature).\r\n\r\n  However the comment about \"pre-warm the cache\" was incorrect and did\r\n  not happen -- since we run gunicorn by spawning a whole new process\r\n  it doesn't share any state from the current python interpreter.\r\n\r\n- Don't load/initialize providers when only importing airflow.www.views\r\n\r\n  As it was written it would load the providers hook's at import time.\r\n\r\n  This changes it through a combination of cached properties and the\r\n  existing `init_connection_form` function.\r\n\r\n  (`extra_fields` is not set as a cached_property because of how FAB\r\n  works -- it iterates over all attributes of the class

see this case:\r\n 1. i use sequential executor, and use sqlite as db\r\n 2. the dag has two task(as the pic shown below), and there is NO dependeny between

executor in the same schduler loop.\r\n\r\nWhen i stop the dagrun when the first taskinstance(let's assume the is the [sleep_1] step) is running, using set_dag_run_state_to_failed function from airflow.api.common.experimental.mark_tasks. I can see the state of dagrun will be changed into FAILED, and the state of taskinstance of task [sleep_1] will also changed into FAILED, but the taskinstance of [sleep_2] will be left unchanged(queued)\r\n\r\nThen, something weired happend, the task instance of [sleep_2] will be executed as usual. That's not what i want!\r\n\r\nI check the code, and find the sequential executor will still run all the taskintance in commane_to_run list, even if some taskinstance of the same dagrun has already failed. \r\n\r\nAnd, even when running  [airflow task run] command, the check_and_change_state_before_execution function in model/taskinstance.py will not check whether the dagrun of the taskinstance has failed or not.\r\n\r\nSo i add the add DagrunRunningDep into RUNNING_DEPS, and things go right

PR adds a DAG run details page showing information about one single DAG run.\r\n\r\nI have a couple of DAGs where every run is triggered with parameters and found it difficult to trace which parameters were used to trigger a DAG in the Airflow UI. The current flow is:\r\n\r\n1. Hover over DAG run in tree view\r\n2. Memorize a property to identify specific DAG run, usually the run id (memorize because toolbox disappears when cursor leaves the DAG run circle)\r\n3. Go to Browse -> DAG runs\r\n4. Filter using property from step 2\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new button to the modal clicking on a DAG run bar in the tree view:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6249654/142614378-e0702ad7-5e87-40ed-86e9-93e93724e056.png)\r\n\r\nThat brings you to the DAG run details page:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6249654/142614767-3116bfb4-c9fd-4cac-8b3f-666bbfdf6169.png)\r\n","created_at":"2021-11-19T11:27:11Z","updated_at":"2023-08-24T15:39:28Z","closed_at":"2021-11-22T19:33:46Z","merged_at":"2021-11-22T19:33:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"968952bb8d0b410e5cf013f3d0d074fc5783c6f1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ryanahamilton","id":3267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanahamilton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545584474,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTg0NDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:webserver","name":"area:webserver","color":"a9db3f","default":false,"description":"Webserver related Issues"},{"id":2172800071,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcyODAwMDcx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:new-feature","name":"type:new-feature","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog: New Features"},{"id":2458345138,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNDU4MzQ1MTM4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/okay%20to%20merge","name":"okay to merge","color":"64e05c","default":false,"description":"It's ok to merge this PR as it does not require more tests"},{"id":2514952451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTE0OTUyNDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:UI","name":"area:UI","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"Related to UI/UX.

the log group arn contains slashes, the urlparse function parses\r\nthe group name as part of the 'path' instead of including it as part of\r\nthe 'netloc'. This fix concatenates both the 'netloc' and 'path' fields\r\ntogether to use as the group arn. For group names without slashes, the\r\nfunctionality remains the same as the group name is still parsed as part\r\nof the 'netloc' field and the 'path' field will be empty.\r\n\r\nFix #19783.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

make it optional to use an airflow connection.   In order to use k8s hook with k8s pod op, we need connection to be optional because up to now k8s pod operator does not use airflow connection.\r\n\r\nFor the new hook params, I parameterized the relevant tests and added a lot of cases in order to verify search path (hook param beats conn extra)\r\n\r\nThe principal motivator here is enabling the use of KubernetesHook with KubernetesPodOperator while maintaining backward

using UI form widgets FAB provides a empty string by default for every param.  This turns out to make a difference sometimes.  E.g. in this hook, we decide what to do depending on whether the param `is not None` -- and if you've created the connection in the UI, even though you didn't supply a value for this param, it will be `not None`\r\n\r\nIn this case, I do not think this is a breaking change because e.g. if `kubeconfig_path` is empty string then loading it should fail.

the error `TypeError: __init__() got multiple values for argument 'sdk_client'`.\r\n\r\nI created this small test to understand the problem.\r\n```python\r\nfrom typing import Any, Dict, List, Optional, Sequence, Union\r\n\r\nclass BaseHook:\r\n    pass\r\n\r\n\r\nclass AzureBaseHook(BaseHook):\r\n    def __init__(self, sdk_client: Any, conn_id: str = 'azure_default'):\r\n        print(sdk_client)\r\n        self.sdk_client = sdk_client\r\n        self.conn_id = conn_id\r\n        super().__init__()\r\n\r\nclass AzureContainerInstanceHook(AzureBaseHook):\r\n    def

AzureContainerInstanceHook(\"abc\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen the keyword is missing from `AzureContainerInstanceHook` the first positional argument is assumed to be `sdk_client`.\r\nWhen you change the code to `AzureContainerInstanceHook(conn_id=\"abc\")`, this issue is fixed.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

change was previously made and then reverted bc it caused static assets to load incorrectly.. The bug has been fixed by explicitly passing the name \"flask_appbuilder.base\" into the blueprint.\r\n\r\nThis is part of the ongoing epic to refactor Airflow's auth architecture. Currently, the auth code includes methods that are no longer needed given how Airflow uses auth, but they're still required by FABs base class. By copying the base class directly into Airflow, with attribution to Daniel Gaspar, FAB's author, we can modify the base class as necessary to simplify Airflow's auth code.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the blueprint name, the only change is customizing the behavior of `. _check_and_init()`.\r\n\r\nTl;Dr -- Copies FAB's AppBuilder class directly into

the create-users as well as the run-airflow-migrations job of the helm chart do not mount the airflow_local_settings file. In all deployments, this mount is provided. \r\nDepending on the use of the airflow_local_settings it is helpful to have those settings available in the jobs as well. Example: If one uses custom logging settings that are loaded via the airflow config, airflow does not start if the local settings file is not available. \r\n\r\nThis PR adds the mount to those two jobs.

we optimized tests for memory use we added cleanup of all\r\ncontainers after each test suite.

you run start-airflow, by default it also run `yarn dev`\r\ncommand, however if you've never built assets before, yarn dev\r\nis very slow first time and the webserver started before the dist\r\nfolder was even created which caused asset-less airflow experience.\r\n\r\nThere was another race condition even if you did build the\r\nassets before. If you run start-airflow on MacOS or Windows when\r\nthe filesystem was slow, there could be a case that yarn dev\r\ncleaned up the dist folder while webserver was starting and\r\nit could lead again to asset-less experience if you were unlucky.\r\n\r\nAlso running `yarn dev` has the side effect of removing the checksum\r\nfile which is used to see if any of the assets changed and whether\r\nthey need recompilation. As the result after running `start-airflow`\r\nyou always got the warning that the assets need recompilation.\r\n\r\nThis PR disables automated start of `yarn dev` and suggests to run\r\nit manually instead if there is a need for dynamic asset\r\nrecompilation. Also when `start-airflow` is run and we are starting\r\nairflow from sources rather than PyPI, asset compilation is\r\nexecuted if the checksum is missing or does not match the source\r\nfiles.\r\n\r\nRelated to: #19566\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

task is executed using \"StandardTaskRunner._start_by_exec()\" (when fork is not available) it's using old DONOT_MODIFY_HANDLERS config variable loaded during settings.py load and not the one from externally supplied --cfg-path    param\r\n\r\n**TL;DR**\r\n\r\nWhen \"tasks run\" command is executed it then internally re-executed as below command using external process (non fork when it's not available).\r\n```[2021-11-16 15:28:16,818] {base_task_runner.py:144} INFO - Running: ['airflow', 'tasks', 'run', 'test_logging_dag', 'test_task', 'test_run', '--job-id', '102', '--raw', '--subdir', 'DAGS_FOLDER', '--cfg-path', '/tmp/tmpfv4cj9py', '--error-file', '/tmp/tmphjtaj5gi']  ```\r\n\r\nHere `'--cfg-path', '/tmp/tmpfv4cj9py'` is a copy of active config settings of parent process. When command is executed settings.py file is loaded as one of the first things but external config (/tmp/tmpfv4cj9py) is load later within task_command.py->def task_run. \r\nAnd when it does load it does not re-initialize this setting. \r\nThis causes DONOT_MODIFY_HANDLERS to be initialized to a default value rather than one that is defined in the /tmp/tmpfv4cj9py\r\nThe PR fixes it by moving initialization into settings.py/configure_vars function where it can be called when needed.\r\n\r\nPS:\r\nI think this issue is not limited to this variable but all other similar GLOBAL variables that is initialized during settings.py load. \r\nBut I think we need to check each of them separately before making similar changes.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the
