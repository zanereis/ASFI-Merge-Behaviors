However, currently some Hudi `Partitioner`s actually assume that parallelism level will always be present, which might not be the case now that we recently removed default parallelism levels.\r\n\r\nProper fix for this is to make sure that `Partitioner`s don't assume that parallelism is always present. However, for the sake of 0.13, i'm adding the fallback to use Spark's session default parallelism level instead.\r\n\r\nCreated HUDI-5716 to follow up after 0.13\r\n\r\n###

Change Logs\r\n\r\n> NOTE: This is a squashed version of the original PR #6361\r\n\r\nThis PR cleans up considerable amount of Spark's (internal) resolution logic that has been copied over into Hudi components, while in reality there's no actual need for that -- instead we can rely on Spark itself to resolve most of these\r\nconstructs and instead plugin our custom implementation (post-hoc) after resolution has been performed.\r\n\r\nIssues this will be addressing (among others): \r\n - HUDI-4503 \r\n - HUDI-4690\r\n - HUDI-4872\r\n - HUDI-4861\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nResolves many Spark SQL issues stemming from the inconsistent implementation of Hudi's bespoke resolution rules.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nMedium\r\n\r\nThis is being verified t/h a combination of \r\n - CI (GH/Azure)\r\n - Long running Jenkins job (verifying Spark DS aspect of it)\r\n - Benchmarking\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Contributor's

Change Logs\r\nThis adds two commands to the hudi-cli: \"show restores\" and \"show restore --instant INSTANT_VALUE\". This addresses the issue raised in Hudi JIRA: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-1593 \r\nThe code has been implemented similar to RollbacksCommand and TestRollbacksCommand of hudi-cli.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\nAdds two new commands inside hudi-cli: \"show restores\" and \"show restore --instant INSTANT_VALUE\"\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\nLow. New functionality via new classes. Does not affect existing functionality.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\nThis new command needs to be documented. JIRA ticket created for that here: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-5719\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n- [x] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [x] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [x] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\nWhen **MDT is enabled** and **users choose KEEP_LATEST_FILE_VERSIONS as clean policy,** current master branch will read MDT and check all partitions one by one to pick up deleted data files.\r\n\r\n```\r\n      Map<String, Pair<Boolean, List<CleanFileInfo>>> cleanOpsWithPartitionMeta = context\r\n          .map(partitionsToClean, partitionPathToClean ->

`listPartitions(list)` API.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nEnable MDT and use KEEP_LATEST_FILE_VERSIONS as clean policy\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis patch introduce reconcile strategy and add dynamic schema strategy. Existing reconcile strategy is deemed as \"legacy\". \r\n\r\nLegacy reconcile strategy:\r\nif newer incoming has more columns than table schema, newer incoming will be chosen as the new table schema. \r\nif newer incoming has few columns than table schema, table schema will remain as is. \r\nNo other flows are supported. \r\n\r\nDynamic schema reconcile strategy:\r\nThis is a super set of legacy. In this, newer incoming can have some dropped columns and could have new columns as well compared to table schema. New table schema will be last known table schema + new columns in new batch (even if new batch had some dropped columns, hudi will auto fill nulls) \r\n\r\nEg illustration:\r\ncommit1 with col1, col2, col3 -> tableSchema: col1, col2, col3\r\ncommit2 with col1, col2, col3, col4 -> tableSchema: col1, col2, col3, col4\r\n// dropping cols\r\ncommit3 with col1, col2, col4 -> tableSchema: col1, col2, col3, col4\r\n// dropping cols(col2, col4) and adding new col(col5, col6) \r\ncommit4 with col1, col3, col5, col6 -> tableSchema: col1, col2, col3, col4, col5, col6\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nMore flexibility in evolving schemas w/ hudi. \r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow. \r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nIntroducing a new config named `hoodie.datasource.write.reconcile.schema.strategy`. Default value is `legacy_reconcile_strategy`. and to leverage dynamic schema, value to set is `dynamic_schema_reconcile_strategy`. \r\nUsers have to set reconcile `hoodie.datasource.write.reconcile.schema` to true to leverage this.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2023-02-06T01:18:39Z","updated_at":"2024-02-26T19:31:05Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":{"login":"codope","id":16440354,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQwMzU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16440354?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope","html_url":"https://github.com/codope","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"codope","id":16440354,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQwMzU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16440354?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope","html_url":"https://github.com/codope","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2284138194,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMjg0MTM4MTk0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/schema-and-data-types","name":"schema-and-data-types","color":"ceae46","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2719802999,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE5ODAyOTk5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/priority:major","name":"priority:major","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":"degraded

is enabled or not. \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nColumn drop flag will be honored in all cases. \r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2023-02-05T05:17:48Z","updated_at":"2023-02-06T07:10:35Z","closed_at":"2023-02-06T07:10:35Z","merged_at":"2023-02-06T07:10:35Z","merge_commit_sha":"f8772de6dc475dfc5aa990cb3c04606d552948e2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2610270804,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjEwMjcwODA0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/priority:blocker","name":"priority:blocker","color":"78FA72","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/7856/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/7856/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/7856/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/statuses/c70e58ea6a70a838ba4e8bcc5c5add6424dea850","head":{"label":"nsivabalan:release-0.13.0-colDrop-SchemaValidate-fix","ref":"release-0.13.0-colDrop-SchemaValidate-fix","sha":"c70e58ea6a70a838ba4e8bcc5c5add6424dea850","user":{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":159547623,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTk1NDc2MjM=","name":"hudi","full_name":"nsivabalan/hudi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan/hudi","description":"Spark

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR makes a few improvements around the `ConfigProperty` for auto-generating configuration docs on our website:\r\n- Adds `subGroupName` and `areCommonConfigs` in `ConfigClassProperty` annotation.  Now we can structures the configs in three-level hierarchy (previously, it's two-level): `groupName` -> `subGroupName` (optional) -> config class.  New `SubGroupNames` in `ConfigGroups` is added for the sub-group name.  `areCommonConfigs` indicates whether these are common configs, showing as the first in the sub-group if true.\r\n- Restructures index, lock, and commit configs:\r\n  - LOCK sub-group: `HoodieLockConfig`, `DynamoDbBasedLockConfig`\r\n  - INDEX sub-group: `HoodieIndexConfig`, `HoodieHBaseIndexConfig`\r\n  - COMMIT_CALLBACK sub-group: `HoodieWriteCommitCallbackConfig`, `HoodieWriteCommitKafkaCallbackConfig`, `HoodieWriteCommitPulsarCallbackConfig`\r\n- Adds the ability to provide docs on the default value in `ConfigProperty`: `docOnDefaultValue`, `getDocOnDefaultValue()`, so that the note on default can be shown on the configuration page.\r\n- Adds `hasInferFunction()` in `ConfigProperty`\r\n- Removes `ConfigClassProperty` annotation for `HoodieTableConfig` so they do not show up on the configuration page, as these are not meant to be changed by the user.\r\n- Adds description for `META_SYNC` and `AWS` config groups\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nAdds `ConfigProperty` APIs and new fields in `ConfigClassProperty` annotation for auto-generating configuration docs.\r\n\r\n### Risk

Change Logs\r\n\r\nCurrently, after most DML operations in Spark SQL, Hudi invokes `Catalog.refreshTable`\r\n\r\nPrior to Spark 3.2, this was essentially doing the following:\r\n\r\n1. Invalidating relation cache (forcing relation to be resolved again during next read, creating new `FileIndex`, listing files, etc)\r\n2. Trigger cascading invalidation (re-caching) of the cached data (in CacheManager)\r\n\r\nAs of Spark 3.2 it now additionally does `LogicalRelation.refresh` for ALL table-types (while previously this was only done for Temporary Views), therefore entailing \r\n - Whole table to be re-listed again by triggering `FileIndex.refresh` which might be costly operation.\r\n\r\nThis change attempts to revert back to previous behavior from Spark 3.1, where `LogicalRelation` are not refreshed until they are actually read again.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nAvoiding costly `FileIndex.refresh` operations on the write path\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nHigh (we need to carefully explore repercussions of adjusting refreshing behavior on all Spark versions)\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2023-02-03T22:31:19Z","updated_at":"2024-02-26T19:28:46Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":{"login":"xushiyan","id":2701446,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDE0NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2701446?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan","html_url":"https://github.com/xushiyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"xushiyan","id":2701446,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDE0NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2701446?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan","html_url":"https://github.com/xushiyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"xushiyan","id":2701446,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDE0NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2701446?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan","html_url":"https://github.com/xushiyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2719800718,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE5ODAwNzE4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/priority:critical","name":"priority:critical","color":"B60205","default":false,"description":"production

Change Logs\r\n\r\nLooks like we are parsing all partitions and files from file system to initialize metadata table for a new data table. We eventually end up filtering out all files since none of them belongs to completed commit.\r\n\r\nto illustrate w/ an example. \r\nLets say we start a new table w/ commit C1. \r\nC1 creates 100 files across 100 partitions.\r\ntowards end of the commit, we will instantiate Metadata table. This will list all partitions and files (during file listing) and populate the first commit to metadata table. But we do not want to include files which are not part of completed commits. So, we choose only files whose base instant time > initialCommitTime for MDT. for a fresh table, initial commit time is \"00000000000000\". So, after listing all partitions and all files, we end up w/ no files to be added as part of the initial commit. but we still commit atleast the \"all_partitions\" records which will keep track of all partitions, but no other records are added in this commit. \r\nImmediately following this, we will update metadata table for a typical commit from data table. HoodieTableMetadataWriter.update(HoodieCommitMetadata commitMetadata, String instantTime...) \r\n\r\nAnyways, this will have inmemory list of the same 100 files across 100 partitions which will result in DC_1 in metadata table. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis patch is optimizing the above code block of interest. \r\nFix: if its the first commit to MDT and if its a fresh table, we avoid file listing and proceed. \r\nImplementation fix:\r\nwe deduce the initial commit time and if its solo commit (00000000000000), then we avoid the listing. if not, we will go ahead as usual. This will ensure for a table that has 100+ commits already and metadata is enable later, initial commit to metadata have to do file listing and populate records into metadata table. \r\n\r\nThis will impact any new table creation w/ metadata enabled. \r\n\r\nAlso fixed some of the job description (spark) along the way. \r\n\r\nHere is the snapshot for a simple CTAS command w/ and w/o the fix. \r\n<img width=\"1778\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2023-02-03 at 1 36 55 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/513218/216704277-4fc5f572-002a-4d76-8713-f95dbd5112fa.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: the jobs marked in red are extraneous or of no use.\r\n\r\nw/ the fix\r\n<img width=\"1775\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2023-02-03 at 1 13 26 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/513218/216566376-e63374dd-1666-44b5-874f-89221e6dcb92.png\">\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nImproves perf of initialization of metadata table for a new table.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow. \r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis change addresses issue of CTAS erroneously performing de-duplication, due to the fact that\r\n\r\n - It reuses `InsenrtIntoHoodieTableCommand` infrastructure to insert the data\r\n - It provides an extra-options overriding default configs (tuned for Insert Into statement) specifically for CTAS\r\n - Extra options not being merged into the final config (at some point after 0.12.2), resulted into it by default doing de-duplication\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nDisables de-duplication for CTAS by default, makes sure CTAS specific properties are properly propagated.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nLow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThere are 2 steps to getInstantsToRollback for lazy clean \r\n1. get all inflight instants excluding compaction and clustering \r\n2. check whether the heartbeat for the instant is expired. if true, add it to the result of instantsToRollback\r\n\r\nThis approach will cause a problem. If the instant is completed after step 1, the heartbeat file of the instant will be deleted. \r\nThen the instant will be counted as an expired instant, and included in the result of instantsToRollback, which is a fatal error. \r\n\r\nWe fixed it by adding an extra step 3. After checking whether the heartbeat is expired, we reload the active timeline and check if the expired instant is an inflight instant. \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nfix lazy clean schedule rollback on

Change Logs\r\n\r\nCurrently, in case flag `hoodie.combine.before.insert` is set to true and `hoodie.bulkinsert.sort.mode` is set to `NONE`, Bulk Insert Row Writing performance will considerably degrade due to the following circumstances\r\n\r\n - During de-duplication (w/in `dedupRows`) records in the incoming RDD would be reshuffled (by Spark's default `HashPartitioner`) based on `(partition-path, record-key)` into N partitions\r\n - In case `BulkInsertSortMode.NONE` is used as partitioner, no re-partitioning will be performed and therefore each Spark task might be writing into M table partitions\r\n - This in turn entails explosion in the number of created (small) files, killing performance and table's layout\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses performance gap by introducing `TablePartitioningAwarePartitioner` to partition records during de-duplication in a following way\r\n\r\n - In case of the partitioned table, we hash-partition (into Spark partition) based on the value of the partition-path\r\n - In case of the non-partitioned table, we hash-partition (into Spark partition) based on the value of the record-key\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nThis considerably improves writing performance for Bulk Insert Row Writing path w/ enabled de-duplication\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nLow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThe online job runs for 13 days and finds that there are subtasks but no data processing, as shown in the figure below, this job uses the update time as the partition, uses the bucket index, the number of buckets is 128, and the write parallelism is 128. The key is uniform because the file size of each bucket is not much different from the storage point of view. After positioning, there is a skew in the shuffle algorithm.\r\n\r\n![image](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/13054969/13054969_image-2023-02-01-14-45-33-116.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nPotential disadvantages of algorithmic tilt:\r\n  1. The memory usage is uneven, some nodes may have high pressure on the JVM, and TM nodes are prone to timeout\r\n  2. It may cause the checkpoint to time out, because the data will be flushed to hdfs during the snapshot state. If the skew is serious, it will cause some nodes to take too long and cause timeout.\r\n\r\ncurrent algorithm：\r\n![image](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/13054968/13054968_image-2023-02-01-14-50-29-703.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nAlgorithm flaws:\r\n  1. curBucket ∈ [0, numBuckets -1]\r\n  2. For the number of globalHash values in the same partition <= numBuckets number, globalHash is divergent, and mod(globalHash, numPartitions) is easy to conflict\r\n  3. When numBuckets is relatively large, shuffleIndex is prone to conflicts, resulting in skew\r\n\r\nAlgorithm optimization:\r\n\r\n![image](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/13054967/13054967_image-2023-02-01-15-00-14-889.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nkb = key % b; kb ∈ [0, b-1] pw = pt % w;\r\n\r\npw ∈ [0, w-1] shuffleIndex = (pw + kb) % w \r\n\r\nshuffleIndex ∈ [0, w-1] \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn fact, it is to calculate a pw according to the partition first. Pw can be understood as a slot Wn allocated to the partition. Different partitions have a slot.\r\nThen move b slots back on the basis of this slot as the writing of data for this partition\r\n\r\n![image](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/13054966/13054966_image-2023-02-01-15-05-15-491.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nCurrently, `InsertIntoHoodieTable` by default sets `COMBINE_BEFORE_INSERT` config whenever pre-combine field is specified and it's specified in a way that doesn't allow it to be overridden by the user.\r\n\r\nFollowing changes are made to address it, all Spark SQL feature-specific configs are split into dichotomy:\r\n\r\n - Default: settings serving as a default (or preferred) value for the feature (could be overridden by the user)\r\n - Overriding: settings serving as required values for the feature (could NOT be overridden by the user)\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nAvoids combining on insertion for Insert Into and CTAS statements in Spark SQL\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nLow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated

Change Logs\r\nBulkInsert 新增一个根据主键排序的选项：WRITE_BULK_INSERT_SORT_INPUT_BY_RECORD_KEY\r\n\r\nBulkInsert adds an option to sort by primary key: WRITE_BULK_INSERT_SORT_INPUT_BY_RECORD_KEY\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n数据根据主键排序的好处：后续新增数据时 flink 需要扫描的文件会变少，使用内存也会降低\r\n\r\nThe advantage of sorting data according to the primary key: Flink can scan fewer files when new data is added later, and the memory usage will also be reduced\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new

Change Logs\r\nBulkInsert 新增一个根据主键排序的选项：WRITE_BULK_INSERT_SORT_INPUT_BY_RECORD_KEY\r\n\r\nBulkInsert adds an option to sort by primary key: WRITE_BULK_INSERT_SORT_INPUT_BY_RECORD_KEY\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n数据根据主键排序的好处：后续新增数据时 flink 需要扫描的文件会变少，使用内存也会降低\r\n\r\nThe advantage of sorting data according to the primary key: Flink needs to scan fewer files when new data is added later, and the memory usage will also be reduced\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThe Hudi CLI commands which require launching Spark cannot be executed in Hudi CLI shell with hudi-cli-bundle:\r\n```\r\nsavepoint create --commit <latest-commit-timestamp>

message:\r\n```\r\n30977 [Thread-4] INFO  org.apache.hudi.cli.utils.InputStreamConsumer [] - Error: Failed to load org.apache.hudi.cli.commands.SparkMain: org/apache/hudi/common/engine/HoodieEngineContext\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe root cause is that the `hudi-cli-bundle` excludes the classes already in `hudi-spark*-bundle`, such as in `hudi-common` module, and the `hudi-spark*-bundle` is not added to the Spark launcher, so that the Spark job fails due to class not found.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the problem by adding the `hudi-spark*-bundle` specified by env variable `SPARK_BUNDLE_JAR` to the Spark launcher.  Note that `SPARK_BUNDLE_JAR` is required when using `hudi-cli-bundle`.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nEnsures that Hudi CLI commands which require launching Spark can be executed with `hudi-cli-bundle`.  The above CLI commands are tested to be working locally with this fix.\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read

Change Logs\r\n\r\nWe added multi-writer capability to spark streaming w/ this https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/7383 patch. \r\nThis introduced a identifier config(`hoodie.datasource.write.streaming.checkpoint.identifier`) that each writer should set. For a single writer, we should set some default and not ask user to explicitly set the configs. As of now, there is no default and even a single writer is expected to set some value for this if they wish to ensure duplicate records may not get ingested to hudi. \r\n\r\nfor multi-writer scenarios, its fair to expect users to set different identifiers for diff writers. \r\n\r\nAlso added validation that for multi-writer, user is expected to explicitly set value for `hoodie.datasource.write.streaming.checkpoint.identifier`. \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nSimplifying usage of spark streaming for a single writer. \r\nFor multi-writers, we do expect users to explicitly set value for `hoodie.datasource.write.streaming.checkpoint.identifier`. But for single writer, internally we deduce a default value. \r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow. \r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated

Change Logs\r\n\r\nAfter https://github.com/apache/hudi/commit/a70355f44571036d7f99b3ca3cb240674bd1cf91 kryo was added explicitly shaded in a few bundles. But, it missed hudi-hive-sync-bundle. Due to that, hive sync using run_sync_tool woild fail due to `java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com/esotericsoftware/kryo/KryoSerializable`. This PR fixes it. Note that we need to add explicitly in the bundle pom because in the parent pom kryo-shaded is declared in provided scope.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nFix hive sync.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR fix the release scripts:\r\n- `cut_release_branch.sh`: `git push` to master is no longer allowed.  Any commit to merge to master needs approval from a committer.  So `git push origin ${MASTER_BRANCH}` is removed from the script.  A new branch is created for the version upgrade on the master, and the script prompts the release manager to manually open a PR for this.\r\n- `deploy_staging_jars.sh`: Previously, both mvn commands for each profile run tests and upload the jars to the staging area, which is a waste of time.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR improves the defaults of early conflict detection configs:\r\n- `async.conflict.detector.initial_delay_ms`: 30,000 -> 0\r\n- `maxAllowableHeartbeatIntervalInMs` for early conflict detection at the timeline server: 60,000 -> 120,000 to be aligned with existing heartbeat timeout\r\n\r\nThis PR also fixes a bug in `EmbeddedTimelineService` to set the correct `maxAllowableHeartbeatIntervalInMs` for early conflict detection.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nGives better defaults for early conflict detection out of the box.\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nThe defaults of the configs will be automatically updated on the Hudi website once the release docs are updated.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis change addresses a few performance regressions in `HoodieSparkRecord` identified during our recent benchmarking::\r\n\r\n1. `HoodieSparkRecord` rewrites records using `rewriteRecord` and `rewriteRecordWithNewSchema` which do Schema traversals for every record. Instead we should do schema traversal only once and produce a transformer that will directly create new record from the old one.\r\n\r\n2. `HoodieRecord`s currently could be rewritten multiple times even in cases when just meta-fields need to be mixed into the schema (in that case, `HoodieSparkRecord` simply wraps source `InternalRow` into `HoodieInternalRow` holding the meta-fields). This is problematic due to a) `UnsafeProjection` re-using mutable row (as a buffer) to avoid allocation of small objects leading to b) recursive overwriting of the same row.\r\n\r\n3. Records are currently copied for every Executor even for Simple one which actually is not buffering any records and therefore doesn't require records to be copied.\r\n\r\nTo address aforementioned gaps following changes have been implemented:\r\n\r\n 1. Row writing utils have been revisited to decouple `RowWriter` generation from actual application (to the source row; that way actual application is much more efficient). Additionally, considerable number of row-writing utilities have been eliminated as these are purely duplicative.\r\n \r\n 2. `HoodieRecord.rewriteRecord` API is renamed into `prependMetaFields` to clearly disambiguate it from `rewriteRecordWithSchema`\r\n\r\n 3. `WriteHandle` and `HoodieMergeHelper` implementations are substantially simplified and streamlined accommodating being rebased onto `prependMetaFields`\r\n\r\n 4. \r\n \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nTBA\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nLow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-28T03:07:12Z","updated_at":"2023-01-31T16:36:27Z","closed_at":"2023-01-31T16:36:27Z","merged_at":"2023-01-31T16:36:27Z","merge_commit_sha":"628dc8cd851870b3143143cd5cf51c673b2621cb","assignee":{"login":"xushiyan","id":2701446,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDE0NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2701446?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan","html_url":"https://github.com/xushiyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"xushiyan","id":2701446,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDE0NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2701446?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan","html_url":"https://github.com/xushiyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2177611461,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTc3NjExNDYx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/performance","name":"performance","color":"a6fcaf","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2610270804,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjEwMjcwODA0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/priority:blocker","name":"priority:blocker","color":"78FA72","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/7769/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/7769/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/7769/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/statuses/24020a964671b35fb9aa7b86748771fd71512495","head":{"label":"onehouseinc:ak/rfc46-perf-fix","ref":"ak/rfc46-perf-fix","sha":"24020a964671b35fb9aa7b86748771fd71512495","user":{"login":"onehouseinc","id":79297158,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjc5Mjk3MTU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79297158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc","html_url":"https://github.com/onehouseinc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":378248722,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzgyNDg3MjI=","name":"hudi","full_name":"onehouseinc/hudi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"onehouseinc","id":79297158,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjc5Mjk3MTU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79297158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc","html_url":"https://github.com/onehouseinc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/orgs","repos_ur

Change Logs\r\n\r\nWe introduced a new way to scan log blocks in LogRecordReader and have named it as \"hoodie.log.record.reader.use.scanV2\". Fixing the config name to be elegant: \"hoodie.optimized.log.blocks.scan.enable\". Metadata config also has an entry for the same. So, fixing that as well. \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nGood/Understandable config names.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nno.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nConfig docs will automatically be generated during release.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR improves the usability of Hudi CLI bundle by changing `hudi-cli-with-bundle.sh`:\r\n- Adds the ability to specify existing `hudi-cli-bundle` and `hudi-spark-bundle` jars downloaded by user, through environmental variables `CLI_BUNDLE_JAR` and `SPARK_BUNDLE_JAR`.  Currently it assumes that these jars are built inside Hudi repo and there is no way to specify the jars from another path.\r\n- Automatically downloads the auxiliary jars to `auxlib/` for Hudi CLI.  Right now, Hudi CLI bundle still requires additional `org.glassfish:jakarta.el` and `jakarta.el:jakarta.el-api` jars in the Java classpath to start the Hudi CLI shell.  Auto-downloads make it easier for the users.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nMakes `hudi-cli-with-bundle.sh` easier to start Hudi CLI shell.\r\n\r\nThis is tested locally on Spark 3.3.  The Hudi CLI shell can start without any problem.\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nStandardise the usage of variable names pertaining to schemas across Hudi. \r\n\r\nGiven that the output of `InternalSchemaMerger#mergeSchema()` is `mergeSchema` across the codebase, using naming it `fileSchema`, will only confuse developers and users. \r\n\r\nStandardising the usage of variable names will better help convey the general idea of how schema evolution is achieved + aid in debugging (if required).\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNo impact\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website.
