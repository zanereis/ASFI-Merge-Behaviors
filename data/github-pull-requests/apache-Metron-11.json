Contributor Comments\r\nMETRON-777 introduces metron extensions and metron parser extensions. The existing parsers have been moved to be packaged and loaded as extensions.\r\nA maven archetype for creating parser extensions has also been created.\r\n\r\nWhat is missing however is the ability to install a parser extension created outside the metron tree by the archetype into a metron system.\r\nThis PR introduces a REST api to accomplish this.\r\n\r\nAlong with that, this PR introduces a parser extension configuration type, for zookeeper that serves as a registry for installed extensions\r\nand their default configurations.  The idea being that in a follow on effort, the management UI will create a new 'instance' of a parser type\r\nthrough cloning, editing and deploying these configurations.  The included configurations are indexing, enrichment, parser, and elasticsearch.\r\nThere may be multiple of these configurations, as each parser extension library can contain more than one parser.\r\n\r\nNOTE: the elasticsearch template is NOT deployed to elasticsearch at this time. Any parser created will still need a separate step for this.\r\n\r\nOne outstanding question for feedback ->  The configuration tracks the parsers created out of the extension, initially.  In the future this list should\r\nhave new parsers added to it when they are cloned.  This would mean we would want new rest endpoints to edit the configuration ( most likely api to add parser to config {name} ) added\r\n\r\nThis PR is built on top of METRON-777, and should not be merged until METRON-777 is in, and this branched is rebased on to master.\r\n\r\nThis PR also addresses METRON-947, adding Management Stellar function support for the extension configurations\r\n\r\n### USAGE\r\nFor usage, I'll cover creating a parser and deploying it... and deleting it using the rest api.\r\n\r\n## Preparation\r\nIn order to build the parser, we need to build and install the maven plugin to build the bundles, as well as the maven archetype itself.\r\nAt this time, since they are not published to apache maven, this will be a requirement.\r\n\r\n- Build the bundle plugin\r\n```\r\ncd bundles-maven-plugin && mvn -q install && cd ..\r\n```\r\n- Build the archetype\r\n```\r\ncd metron-maven-archetypes/metron-maven-parser-extension-archetype\r\nmvn install\r\ncd ../..\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Create and build a new parser extension\r\n- Make a directory and cd into it\r\n- Create from archetype\r\n```\r\nmvn -U archetype:generate -DarchetypeCatalog=local\r\n```\r\n   - choose the org.apache.metron:metron-maven-parser-extension-archetype (Apache Maven Parser Extension Archetype for Metron) option\r\n   - Fill out the information (information on the parameters is in the README for the archetype)\r\n   - NOTE: ~~at this time, the version must match the metronVersion.  Maven is using version in the parent pom chain, and messing up the plugin dependency~~ [ THIS HAS BEEN RESOLVED]\r\n- cd into the created directory and build the parser extension\r\n```\r\nmvn package\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will result in the tar.gz being created inside the {NAME}-parser-assembly project/target directory\r\n\r\n## start full_dev\r\n- run vagrant up from metron-deployment/vagrant/full_dev_platform\r\n\r\n## add a slot to storm\r\n- log into ambari on http://node1:8080\r\n- add a new slot to the storm config\r\n\r\n## Open swagger\r\n- log into ambari on http://node1:8080\r\n- go into the metron service | quicklinks\r\n- start swagger with user | password\r\n\r\n## Install your parser\r\nIn swagger, using the parser-extension-controller\r\n- drop down the POST method\r\n- use the file selector to select the created .tar.gz\r\n- execute\r\nThe extension should now be installed:\r\n- you should be able to use the other GET methods to review the generated configuration.\r\n  - the configuration will have the extensionID to use for the other {name} operations\r\n- you should be able to view the installed files in hdfs/apps/metron/patterns/{parsername}, hdfs/apps/metron/extensions_alt_lib/\r\n\r\n## Start the parser using rest\r\nStill in swagger\r\n- Use the Kafka Controller and the Storm Controller to create a {parserName} topic, and start a storm job for {parserName}\r\n- In the storm UI you should see the storm instance for the parser\r\nYou should be able to verify using the rest api and the various controllers that the configurations are there and the topics exist and the storm jobs as well\r\n\r\n\r\n## Uninstall your parser\r\n\r\n- STOP and DELETE the Storm topology and Kafka Topic\r\n\r\nIn swagger, using the parser-extension-controller\r\n- drop down the DELETE method\r\n- fill in the name parameter with the extensionID from the config\r\n- exectute\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen complete you should see that the various configurations are all gone, along with the patterns and other things from hdfs\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause this is on METRON-777 the changed file list remains huge.\r\nThe main changes here are those in the metron-interface directories\r\nAs well as those in the metron-common configuration\r\n\r\nIn github, select all changes from 2f9cf0d199c565ae1c7ceb1cfdddfb0ebad96c31 onwards.\r\n\r\n## Testing Stellar\r\n-  create and install an extension as above then: \r\n\r\n### Run Stellar\r\n```bash\r\n[vagrant@node1 ~]$ /usr/metron/0.4.1/bin/stellar  -z node1:2181\r\n```\r\nRun the command:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nCONFIG_GET('PARSER_EXTENSION', 'metron-parser-nice-assembly-0_4_1')\r\n```\r\nverify that the configuration return matches what you would see in the rest client\r\nif you executed  Parser Extension Controller : get /api/v1/ext/parsers/{name} -> name = metron-parser-nice-assembly-0_4_1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\n@dlyle65535 observed that even single-node installs should have ES bind an external interface (as well as loopback) so that external clients can access ES reports. Based on that, FullDev assumes \"node1\" is bound to an external i/f, which didn't work with the latest. This patch will fix the problem.\r\n\r\nDave also recommends as part of this to do a cleanup step: removing metron-deployment/inventory/devimage-vagrant/ and all its contents. It is obsolete and unused, and might be confusing to developers looking for examples to follow.\r\n\r\nTo test, install FullDev and see that the ES config is good.  \r\nAlso install single node manually and check ES config still good.\r\nThere shouldn't be any other observable changes.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nPretty much just editing the POM to actually set up Checkstyle with the Google Code Style, per the dev thread.\r\n\r\nSee [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html)\r\n\r\nNote that the Checkstyle version is set to ~7.7~ 8.0.  I've tested it with the plugin version and had no issues at all, but if anyone is concerned, we can lower it to either the default or another version.\r\n\r\n### IntelliJ warnings\r\nTo pull into IntelliJ, please see https://github.com/jshiell/checkstyle-idea#configuration\r\nEssentially the instructions are to:\r\n\r\n-  Install the plugin (Available in IntelliJ's directly)\r\n- Go into Settings -> Other Settings -> Checkstyle\r\n- Change \"Checkstyle version\" to ~7.7~ 8.0.\r\n- Apply.  Otherwise the new file won't match the version and an error will be thrown.\r\n- Add a new Checkstyle file\r\n  - ~This can either be a local file or a remote one (remote will attempt to update periodically, so if you don't want to repeatedly connect to the URL, download the file somewhere and load it in).  Either works. For 7.7, use [google_checks.xml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/master/src/main/resources/google_checks.xml)~ Use the checkstyle.xml file included in the root directory of the project.  This file is identical to [google_checks.xml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/master/src/main/resources/google_checks.xml), but we may choose to change it in the future.\r\n  - If you have errors, you most likely need to make sure you're set to the right version and have applied it.\r\n- Select the checkbox for the new style\r\n- Apply\r\n\r\nTo ensure it's setup properly, open a file, e.g. `metron-platform/metron-common/src/main/java/org/apache/metron/common/dsl/functions/StringFunctions.java`\r\n\r\nNew warnings should show up that are based on Checkstyle, e.g.\r\n```\r\nCheckstyle: WhitespaceAround: 'if' is not followed by whitespace. Empty blocks may only be represented as {} when not part of a multi-block statement\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Code formatting\r\nThere are two options for code formatting. One is to import the checkstyle.xml file from the project root.  The other is to import Google's IntelliJ editor settings for coverage.  In practice, Google's direct IntelliJ settings seem to handle autoformatting better. The instructions are essentially the same for each.  Note that if we choose to modify the checkstyle.xml we may also want to update the IntelliJ settings.\r\n\r\nGoogle's setup is described at https://github.com/HPI-Information-Systems/Metanome/wiki/Installing-the-google-styleguide-settings-in-intellij-and-eclipse.  The direct Checkstyle can be imported similarly, but choosing the CheckStyle Configuration when doing Import Scheme.\r\n\r\n### Required Follow-up\r\nThis will require updating the wiki at https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Development+Guidelines (Section 2.2).  It needs to be switched to the Google code conventions, and the instructions above for formatting and warnings should be pulled in.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nTo get the checkstyle report do:\r\n```\r\nmvn clean install -DskipTests\r\nmvn site site:stage-deploy site:deploy -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true \r\n```\r\nNavigate to file:///tmp/metron/site/checkstyle-aggregate.html in a browser.\r\nYou should see\r\n`The following document contains the results of Checkstyle 8.0 with google_checks.xml ruleset.` and a set of warnings. In practice, most of them are fixed by batch autoformatting, per discussions, which will be a followup task.\r\n\r\n### Misc\r\nNo enforcement of Checkstyle is made, and in fact, by default checkstyle.xml sets everything to warning. The thought is that we'd need to pretty significantly reduce the number of warnings, and probably think through how we want to handle it.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nAdds a Zeppelin dashboard that lets the user get connection counts filtered by a CIDR block.\r\n\r\nThe implementation is a little kludgy because Spark/Hive don't have easy operations to handle things like IPs and CIDRs. I'd have liked to keep it in one paragraph, but the clunkiness around handling the ips and cidr made that a pain that seemed significantly worse.  If someone knows an easy way to take care of it, I can quick try it.\r\n\r\nDo we want/need similar paragraphs for the other sources?  Given that we're primarily looking for volume of connections, it seems unnecessary, but it might be nice to have (possibly as a follow-on?)  It's pretty to repeat the paragraphs as needed.\r\n\r\nAlso, let me know if there are any verbiage changes (since that came up on another dashboard), or other adjustments that should be made.\r\n\r\n## Test Plan\r\nTo test, spin up full-dev.   To get Yaf data, it'll be necessary to start the sensor-stub\r\n```\r\nservice sensor-stubs start yaf\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt'll also be necessary to add Yaf to the list of sensors run in Ambari. To do so, stop Metron, edit \"Metron Parsers\" to include \"yaf\" (or be yaf only). Start Metron and ensure a yaf topology is present.\r\n\r\nLet data flow through.\r\n\r\nOnce some data has gone through, we'll need to have an instance of Zeppelin.  Because of the size of the Vagrant instance, we'll want to shut down unneeded services.  Shutdown Metron, Kibana, Storm, Kafka, and HBase.\r\n\r\nInstall Zeppelin from \"Actions - Add Service\".  It'll prompt you to install Spark and Hive, do so.  Configuration is pretty trivial, all that's necessary is to set an arbitrary Hive database password.  Let this run.  The Hive service check likes to fail on our Vagrant, but it's benign (some impersonation configuration issue unrelated to actually running our queries).  Ignore it and accept the installation.\r\n\r\nFrom Metron's \"Service Actions\", run the \"Zeppelin Notebook Import\", to load our notebooks into Zeppelin.  Use the quick links to navigate to the Zeppelin UI.\r\n\r\nGo into the \"Metron - Connection Volume Report\" notebook.  Queries can be made by CIDR, e.g. 192.0.0.0/8 to get total amount of traffic by source or by destination IP range.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Changes\r\n\r\n* I have altered Pycapa so that it can consume messages from either the beginning, end or the previously stored offsets of a topic.  This can be done using the `-o` or `--kafka-offset` flag that can be either `begin`, `end`, or `stored`.  This defaults to `end`.\r\n* Added additional information when using the `--pretty-print` flag.  It will now show the partition and offset for a packet, both on the producer-side (sending packets to Kafka) or the consumer-side (receiving packets from Kafka).\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n1. Install Pycapa by [following these instructions](https://github.com/apache/metron/tree/master/metron-sensors/pycapa#installation).\r\n\r\n1. Launch a Kafka Broker on your localhost.  For example, using Kafka installed via Brew on my Mac.\r\n\r\n   ```\r\n   export KAFKA_HOME=/usr/local/Cellar/kafka/0.10.1.1/\r\n   export KAFKA_CONF=$KAFKA_HOME/libexec/config\r\n   zookeeper-server-start $KAFKA_CONF/zookeeper.properties\r\n   kafka-server-start $KAFKA_CONF/server.properties\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n1. Produce some packets.  Assumes you're actively using `en0` and Kafka is at `localhost:9092`.  Let it run until it completes and captures 50 packets.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n     pycapa --producer \\\r\n        --interface en0 \\\r\n        --kafka-broker localhost:9092 \\\r\n        --kafka-topic pcap \\\r\n        --max-packets 50\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Run the consumer. The consumer will not consume any packets.  It starts from the end of the topic, by default, and since there are no active producers, there is nothing new to consume.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    pycapa --consumer \\\r\n        --kafka-broker localhost:9092 \\\r\n        --kafka-topic pcap\r\n        --pretty-print 1\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Run the consumer again, but start from the beginning of the topic.  You should be able to consume all 50 packets.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    pycapa --consumer \\\r\n        --kafka-broker localhost:9092 \\\r\n        --kafka-topic pcap\r\n        --pretty-print 1\r\n        --kafka-offset begin\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\n[Please place any comments here.  A description of the problem/enhancement, how to reproduce the issue, your testing methodology, etc.]\r\n\r\nI stood up full-dev and made sure all kafka endpoints continue to work. I also created a postman [script](https://gist.github.com/jjmeyer0/49461a0665fd19a4cac5b2f31e524840) that uses [this](https://github.com/postmanlabs/newman/blob/develop/examples/parallel-collection-runs.js) to execute the postman scripts in parallel. I executed a few thousand requests against the API with no issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

changed the unit tests and README to reflect the new functionality. You can test this feature change by spinning up the Stellar REPL and executing the following example. If you wish test locally using the Stellar REPL, this can be done by doing the following:\r\n```\r\n$ cd ${METRON_HOME}/metron-analytics/metron-statistics/target\r\n$ java -cp metron-statistics-0.4.0.jar org.apache.metron.common.stellar.shell.StellarShell\r\n```\r\n\r\nTest example:\r\n```\r\n1 [Stellar]>>> foo := []\r\n2 [Stellar]>>> set1 := HLLP_MERGE(foo)\r\n3 [Stellar]>>> set1\r\n4 [Stellar]>>> HLLP_CARDINALITY(set1)\r\n0\r\n5 [Stellar]>>> foo := [HLLP_INIT(5,6)]\r\n6 [Stellar]>>> set1 := HLLP_MERGE(foo)\r\n7 [Stellar]>>> set1\r\norg.apache.metron.statistics.approximation.HyperLogLogPlus@1\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that step 2 should NOT throw an exception any longer. Step 3 will produce no output because `set1` is null. Step 4 shows that cardinality on a null argument now returns 0. Note how the output differs for `set1` in step 7 after passing in a list that is not empty - it will list the HLLP set reference.\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

was checking input.size() instead of args.size(). The input var is the first arg to the reduce function, so it was returning null if fewer than 3 items existed in the list. I've corrected the function to return null if the number of arguments to the function itself is fewer than the expected 3.\r\n\r\nA simple set of unit tests has been added. This can also be manually tested by starting the Stellar REPL and testing that the following calls do not return null:\r\n```\r\nh1 := REDUCE(['foo', 'bar'], (s, x) -> HLLP_ADD(s, x), HLLP_INIT(5, 6))\r\ns1 := REDUCE([1,2], (s, x) -> STATS_ADD(s, x), STATS_INIT())\r\n```\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nChanges as specified in email thread and METRON-905:\r\n1. Document network.host parameter with ref to ES docs.\r\n2. Add network.publish_host parameter, default empty, with same docs ref.\r\n3. For single-node and QuickDev deployments, set the default value of network.host to [ _local_ ] .\r\n4. For multi-node and FullDev, set the default value to [ _local_, _site_ ] .\r\n5. For generic ambari install, set the default value to [ _local_ ] but document this is for single-node installs, and for cluster installs it must be changed to add _site_ .\r\n6. For network_host and zen_discovery_ping_unicast_hosts, require that brackets and quotes be provided explicitly as part of the config value, consistent with ES config requirements.\r\n\r\nI wanted to get the code changes out for shared testing soonest.  I will add some docs changes to the PR, at the README level.\r\n\r\nThis needs to be tested against each of our deployment modes:\r\n* QuickDev\r\n* FullDev\r\n* manual Ambari, single node\r\n* manual Ambari, multi-node (with manual edit to default network_host value)\r\n* EC2\r\n* other Vagrant/Ansible?\r\n* a multi-homed cluster, with non-empty network_publish_host ( @JonZeolla ?)\r\n* Other?\r\n\r\nVolunteers are humbly begged to claim and exercise one or more.\r\nIn each configuration, one should see ES come up, without errors in Ambari, and without configuration exceptions in elasticsearch logs (/var/log/elasticsearch/metron.log, in Centos7) on any ES host.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nFor a given IP address,  produces a report of:\r\n* Most Frequent Connections (Yaf, defaults to 24 hours) \r\n* Recent Connections (Yaf, defaults to 1 hour)\r\n* Top DNS Queries (Bro, defaults to 24 hours)\r\n* All Ports Used (Yaf, defaults to 24 hours)\r\n* HTTP User Agents (Bro, defaults to 24 hours)\r\n\r\n## Test Plan\r\n### Setup\r\nThe setup is exactly the same as @justinleet described in PR-556, repeated here:\r\n\r\nTo test, spin up full-dev. Ensure data flows through for the sensors.  For Yaf, which is not enabled by default, it'll be necessary to start the sensor-stub\r\n```\r\nservice sensor-stubs start yaf\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt'll also be necessary to add Yaf to the list of sensors run in Ambari. To do so, stop Metron, edit \"Metron Parsers\" to include \"yaf\" (or if the other sensors already have data output, feel free to just make it \"yaf\" only).\r\n\r\nLet data flow through for a little while (enough so that we can reasonable make range filters).\r\n\r\nOnce some data has gone through, we'll need to have an instance of Zeppelin.  Because of the size of the Vagrant instance, we'll want to shut down unneeded services.  Shutdown Metron, Kibana, Storm, Kafka, and HBase.\r\n\r\nInstall Zeppelin from \"Actions - Add Service\".  It'll prompt you to install Spark and Hive, do so.  Configuration is pretty trivial, all that's necessary is to set an arbitrary Hive database password.  Let this run.  The Hive service check likes to fail on our Vagrant, but it's benign (some impersonation configuration issue unrelated to actually running our queries).  Ignore it and accept the installation.\r\n\r\nFrom Metron's \"Service Actions\", run the \"Zeppelin Notebook Import\", to load our notebooks into Zeppelin.  Use the quick links to navigate to the Zeppelin UI.\r\n\r\nGo into the \"Metron IP Report\" notebook. Instructions are in the first paragraph of the readme.\r\n\r\nNote: If you've run for less than an hour (which I recommend), the first 2 reports will have the same data.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to validate the data, use the following queries. The first 4 will validate against Elasticsearch and the final report will validate against HDFS. This is because we don't store an unanalyzed user_data field.\r\n\r\nRun the following from an ssh session to node1 (as root).\r\n\r\n### Most Frequent Connections (and Recent Connections)\r\n```\r\ncurl -XPOST 'node1:9200/y*/_search?pretty' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'\r\n{\r\n   \"size\": 0,\r\n   \"query\": {\r\n      \"filtered\": {\r\n         \"query\": {\r\n            \"match\": {\r\n               \"ip_src_addr\": \"192.168.138.158\"\r\n            }\r\n         }\r\n      }\r\n   },\r\n   \"aggs\": {\r\n      \"ip_dst_addr\": {\r\n         \"terms\": {\r\n            \"field\": \"ip_dst_addr\"\r\n         }\r\n      }\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n'\r\n```\r\n### Top DNS Queries \r\n```\r\ncurl -XPOST 'node1:9200/b*/_search?pretty' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'\r\n{\r\n   \"size\": 0,\r\n   \"query\": {\r\n      \"bool\": {\r\n         \"must\": [\r\n            {\r\n               \"term\": {\r\n                  \"ip_src_addr\": \"192.168.138.158\"\r\n               }\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n               \"term\": {\r\n                  \"protocol\": \"dns\"\r\n               }\r\n            }\r\n         ]\r\n      }\r\n   },\r\n   \"aggs\": {\r\n      \"domain_name\": {\r\n         \"terms\": {\r\n            \"field\": \"query\"\r\n         }\r\n      }\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n'\r\n```\r\n### All Ports Used\r\n```\r\ncurl -XPOST 'node1:9200/y*/_search?pretty' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'\r\n{\r\n   \"size\": 0,\r\n   \"query\": {\r\n      \"bool\": {\r\n         \"must\": [\r\n            {\r\n               \"term\": {\r\n                  \"ip_src_addr\": \"192.168.138.158\"\r\n               }\r\n            }\r\n         ]\r\n      }\r\n   },\r\n   \"aggs\": {\r\n      \"user_agent\": {\r\n         \"terms\": { \"field\" : \"ip_dst_port\"}\r\n      }\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n'\r\n```\r\n### HTTP User Agents (verify count of MSIE 8.0 User Agent)\r\n```\r\nhdfs dfs -cat /apps/metron/indexing/indexed/bro/en* | grep http | grep 'MSIE 8.0' | wc -l\r\n```\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nIf you run the old steps you will install multiple inaccurate versions of tools:\r\n1.  Maven `3.5.0` will be installed, but we specifically request people use `3.3.9`.\r\n1.  Ansible latest is now `2.3.0.0`, and we request `2.2.2.0`.  This has been a specific point of issue, although I have not tested `2.3.0.0`.\r\n1.  `brew cask install docker` does not install the components which we expect to exist, specifically the docker daemon.  I have only ever found the required components to be available when installing via their [install steps](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/).  Happy to be proven wrong on this one, but when I checked around with others, it seems everybody that I've spoken with actually follow these steps anyway.\r\n\r\nI also purposefully removed some versioning granularity based off of experience, in hopes that this will continue to be accurate for a longer period of time.  For instance, I'm fairly certain any version of Python 2.7.x works just fine with Metron, and that the Vagrant and Virtualbox versions (as long as they are relatively new) are not an issue.\r\n\r\nNote I removed the link to use the Ansible-provided instructions to install via brew because they do not support installing anything other than the latest (currently 2.3.0.0), as documented [here](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask/issues/25305) and [here](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_installation.html#latest-releases-via-pip).\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nUninstall the prereqs from your machine and install using the steps provided.  Spin up full-dev, quick-dev, etc. using the versions provided in the above steps.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThe added Zeppelin dashboard is pretty straightforward.\r\n\r\nFor each of the sensors (Bro/Snort/Yaf) and for all three as a whole, groups everything by (ip_src_addr,ip_dst_addr) for a given range, counts it all up, and spits out tables.\r\n\r\nThe range is provided by two fields, start and end, which are dates that can be formatted by a user provided formatting string.  e.g.\r\n```\r\n2017-04-28 14:19:19 -> yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss\r\n2017-04-28 -> yyyy-MM-dd\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Test Plan\r\nTo test, spin up full-dev. Ensure data flows through for the sensors.  For Yaf, which is not enabled by default, it'll be necessary to start the sensor-stub\r\n```\r\nservice sensor-stubs start yaf\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt'll also be necessary to add Yaf to the list of sensors run in Ambari. To do so, stop Metron, edit \"Metron Parsers\" to include \"yaf\" (or if the other sensors already have data output, feel free to just make it \"yaf\" only).\r\n\r\nLet data flow through for a little while (enough so that we can reasonable make range filters).\r\n\r\nOnce some data has gone through, we'll need to have an instance of Zeppelin.  Because of the size of the Vagrant instance, we'll want to shut down unneeded services.  Shutdown Metron, Kibana, Storm, Kafka, and HBase.\r\n\r\nInstall Zeppelin from \"Actions - Add Service\".  It'll prompt you to install Spark and Hive, do so.  Configuration is pretty trivial, all that's necessary is to set an arbitrary Hive database password.  Let this run.  The Hive service check likes to fail on our Vagrant, but it's benign (some impersonation configuration issue unrelated to actually running our queries).  Ignore it and accept the installation.\r\n\r\nFrom Metron's \"Service Actions\", run the \"Zeppelin Notebook Import\", to load our notebooks into Zeppelin.  Use the quick links to navigate to the Zeppelin UI.\r\n\r\nGo into the \"Metron - Connection Report\" notebook.\r\n\r\nEach service (and the aggregate) will have something similar to the following:\r\n<img width=\"1416\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-04-28 at 11 53 17 am\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5077341/25536613/764888ea-2c09-11e7-876f-0779cf955ee7.png\">\r\n\r\nIn my case, note the second row:\r\n```\r\n192.168.66.1\t192.168.66.121\t439\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe want to validate this range, so we can check ES and see what a count against the same range returns\r\n```\r\ncurl -XPOST 'node1:9200/y*/_count?pretty' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'\r\n{\r\n   \"query\": {\r\n      \"filtered\": {\r\n         \"filter\": {\r\n            \"and\": [\r\n               {\r\n                  \"bool\": {\r\n                     \"must\": [\r\n                        {\r\n                           \"term\": {\r\n                              \"ip_src_addr\": \"192.168.66.1\"\r\n                           }\r\n                        },\r\n                        {\r\n                           \"term\": {\r\n                              \"ip_dst_addr\": \"192.168.66.121\"\r\n                           }\r\n                        }\r\n                     ]\r\n                  }\r\n               },\r\n               {\r\n                  \"range\": {\r\n                     \"timestamp\": {\r\n                        \"gte\": 1493389159000,\r\n                        \"lt\": 1493389859000\r\n                     }\r\n                  }\r\n               }\r\n            ]\r\n         }\r\n      }\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n'\r\n```\r\nThe result is:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"count\" : 439,\r\n  \"_shards\" : {\r\n    \"total\" : 1,\r\n    \"successful\" : 1,\r\n    \"failed\" : 0\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThey're the same, so we're good.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the dates and formatting can be changed and run as well.\r\n\r\nThis exercise can be repeated across the sensors.\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nIt appears that `bro_index.template` regressed a bit when it was migrated to the ambari mpack.  If you run this up in vagrant and let the bro sensor-stub run for a while you will see ES indexing issues for dns logs because answers is not always an IP address.  This fixes that, and I will try to get a look at the whole bro ES indexing template for other issues, as a part of METRON-508.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-899\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this PR is to address a bad merge that occurred with the Kerberos manual and Ambari MPack docs. I'd like this to be looked over by more than 1 other committer because of the complexity of the conflict resolution. \r\n\r\nTo verify, please review the changes I've made. Also be sure to run through the site-book changes to make sure my fixes there work as intended. The images weren't rendering before.\r\n\r\nThe steps I took in order to resolve this are as follows\r\n\r\n1. Revert Kerberos-setup.md to jusinleet's version before METRON-835. Take Nick's original branch changes (before the merge) from METRON-835 and replace the manual instructions in metron-deployment.\r\n1. Manually re-apply Nick's merge changes from METRON-835 to the manual Kerberos instructions.\r\n1. Manually re-apply Justin's changes post-move/copy to the manual Kerberos instructions. Refactor the docs to keep common tasks in the manual doc rather than the Ambari doc. \r\n1. Move the Ambari Kerberos instructions from vagrant to metron-deployment and rename as Ambari setup.\r\n1. Fix the site-book to properly resolve the images - this was in part to address my moving the readme for Ambari, but also a pre-existing condition.\r\n\r\nEach of the above steps reflects a commit I made that should hopefully make each transformation to the docs more clear. At first I thought I could do a simple revert on the file and copy the changes to the new manual Kerberos doc, but there was more to it than that. The reason this became as difficult as it was to resolve is because it wasn't as simple as a basic content diff. There were numerous factors involved:\r\n\r\n- New content\r\n- Modified formatting\r\n- More new content with other PR's still in flux\r\n- More new content with original content migrated to a new location and also modified\r\n- A PR (835) merged on top of a file that appeared at a glance to still be the original + 835's changes, but was in fact was greatly modified by another PR.\r\n- At any given time, there were as many as 4 PR's modifying or moving this doc\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nAdded a couple lines to the doc about setting up tickets as renewable, if they aren't already.\r\nSee: https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-1.12/doc/admin/conf_files/kdc_conf.html, specifically max_renewable_life may have to be set to a nonzero value.  Interestingly, full dev doesn't care, but an actual (non-AWS) cluster did care.  I'm guessing this is related to some version or OS differences or something, but I'm not entirely sure.\r\n\r\nAlso added a couple lines to both manual and full dev docs about how to verify a ticket is renewable, and how to modify the principals to add the appropriate flags if needed.\r\n\r\nGiven that it's potentially a versioning type thing, and the solutions are Kerberos specific issues, I don't know how much of a test plan we need/want to repeat it. We're giving KDC instructions as a convenience, not supporting the KDC itself.  To me, this feels like a best-effort type attempt to address issues.  If we feel that way as a group, I'd be interested in if anyone wants to modify or update the READMEs to reflect that a bit better.  Otherwise, coming up with a test plan may be a pain, because we'd have to track down the actual root versioning cause.\r\n\r\nI've also included a formatting fix to the docs from while I was in the area.  The newline didn't show up properly in triple backticks in the maven site output.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nFirst, I am very sorry to have broken Full_Dev.\r\n\r\nI believe the issue is the order of execution within the package phase when using profiles to inject executions.\r\n\r\nSimliar to : \r\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/22150209/maven-changes-the-order-of-plugins-of-different-profiles\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-2258\r\n\r\nTo address this, I have injected the copy execution as well as the execute plugin in the profile.  I believe doing this will maintain the correct order, and in my testing spinning up Full Dev a few times it has.\r\n\r\nThis is building in travis as we speak, but I'm posting the PR to get this tested by someone else and reviewed asap.\r\n\r\n###Testing\r\n- spin up full dev\r\n- verify that it installs\r\n- vagrant ssh & ls /localrepo to verify the rpms are deployed\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

This PR reverts that commit until we can figure out the right way to achieve the desired outcome of that PR. \r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

are two versions of the Bro Kafka Plugin.  I authored both of these and contributed one to Metron and the other to Bro itself.  The original goal of doing this was to eventually deprecate the version maintained in Metron, so that the wider community of Bro could use and support the plugin.\r\n\r\nSince this time, Bro has created a plugin management mechanism and is no longer wanting to host plugins.  They are asking individual maintainers to create their own Github repositories to maintain these plugins.  This will require us to continue to support the Bro Kafka Plugin in Metron.\r\n\r\nI had contributed additional enhancements to the version in bro/bro-plugins, which I would like to contribute back to Metron proper, since that is now the version that will live on.  The enhancements address a potential thread-safety issue and also allows data from Bro to be directed to separate Kafka topics.\r\n\r\nThis will enable some follow-on work to package the plugin using Bro's package mechanism.\r\n\r\nValidation\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThe following steps can be used to validate the PR.\r\n\r\n1. Create a working directory.\r\n\r\n   ```\r\n   mkdir metron-temp\r\n   cd metron-temp\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n1.  Launch a CentOS host.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    vagrant init bento/centos-6.7\r\n    vagrant up\r\n    vagrant ssh\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Install some dependencies.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    sudo su -\r\n    yum -y install epel-release\r\n    yum -y install \"@Development tools\" java-1.8.0-openjdk cmake libpcap-devel openssl-devel python-devel\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Create a new Yum repository by creating the file `/etc/yum.repos.d/HDP.repo` with the following content.  This will allow us to install Kafka.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    [HDP-2.5]\r\n    name=HDP-2.5\r\n    baseurl=http://public-repo-1.hortonworks.com/HDP/centos7/2.x/updates/2.5.3.0\r\n    path=/\r\n    enabled=1\r\n    gpgcheck=0\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Install and start Kafka.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    yum -y install kafka\r\n    export PATH=$PATH:/usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker/bin\r\n    zookeeper-server start\r\n    kafka start\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Install Librdkafka.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    wget https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka/archive/v0.9.4.tar.gz  -O - | tar -xz\r\n    cd librdkafka-0.9.4/\r\n    ./configure --prefix=/usr\r\n    make\r\n    make install\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Add Librdkafka to our default load path.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    echo \"/usr/lib\" >> /etc/ld.so.conf.d/bro-plugin.conf\r\n    ldconfig -v\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Build and install Bro.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    yum -y install cmake libpcap-devel openssl-devel python-devel\r\n    wget https://www.bro.org/downloads/release/bro-2.4.1.tar.gz  -O - | tar -xz\r\n    cd bro-2.4.1\r\n    ./configure --prefix=/usr\r\n    make\r\n    make install\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Fetch the code from this PR.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    cd ~\r\n    git clone https://github.com/apache/incubator-metron\r\n    cd incubator-metron\r\n    git pull origin pull/XXX/head\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Install the Bro Plugin.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    cd incubator-metron/metron-sensors/bro-plugin-kafka\r\n    ./configure --bro-dist=/root/bro-2.4.1 --install-root=/usr/lib/bro/plugins/ --with-librdkafka=/usr\r\n    make\r\n    make install\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Add the following to `/usr/share/bro/site/local.bro`\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    @load Bro/Kafka/logs-to-kafka.bro\r\n    redef Kafka::logs_to_send = set(HTTP::LOG, DNS::LOG);\r\n    redef Kafka::topic_name = \"bro\";\r\n    redef Kafka::tag_json = T;\r\n    redef Kafka::kafka_conf = table( [\"metadata.broker.list\"] = \"localhost:9092\" );\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Create a virtual interface called `tap0` to listen on.\r\n\r\n   ```\r\n   yum install -y tunctl\r\n   tunctl -p\r\n   ifconfig tap0 10.0.0.1 up\r\n   ip link set tap0 promisc on\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n1. Configure Bro to listen on virtual interface.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    sed -i 's/eth0/tap0/g' /usr/etc/node.cfg\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Create a Kafka topic called `bro`.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181 --create --topic bro --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1.

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nBefore ambari integration, we had the ability to use the ansible docker image to build and deploy metron, and a workflow around that.\r\n\r\nWith the ambari integration and required rpm-docker build stage that was lost.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes the necessary changes such that metron can be built either in the ansible docker image ( including building the build-rpms profile ) or as currently documented ( only spawning docker when building -P build-rpms ).\r\n\r\nTo do this, two profiles, with automatic activation where created, each with the correct maven execute task for the environment.  If we are in docker already, we just execute the script, if we are not, we execute docker.\r\n\r\nTo test this (docker must be running of course ): \r\nBuild the product normally, and build the rpms \r\n\r\n```\r\n$>cd incubator-metron\r\n$>mvn clean install -D skipTests\r\n$>cd metron-deployment\r\n$> mvn clean package -P build-rpms\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis should work normally. You should see the RPMS user rpm-docker/RPMS/noarch/\r\n\r\nThen\r\n```\r\n$>mvn clean\r\n$>cd ..\r\n$>mvn clean\r\n$>cd metron-deployment/packaging/docker/ansible-docker\r\n$>docker build -t ansible-docker:2.0.0.2 .\r\n$>docker run -it -v {PATH-TO-METRON}/incubator-metron/:/root/incubator-metron ansible-docker:2.0.0.2 bash\r\n$docker>cd incubator-metron\r\n$docker>mvn clean install -DskipTests\r\n$docker>cd metron-deployment\r\n$docker>mvn clean package -P build-rpms\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs before you should see the rpms. \r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron (Incubating).  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nRight now, in stellar, we cannot represent a string literal that contains `'foo'` if the string is quoted with `'` or `\"foo\"` if the string is quoted with `\"`.  This is unfortunate and should be corrected.\r\n\r\nTo test this out, start up the stellar REPL in fulldev *or* run it locally by running `mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=\"org.apache.metron.common.stellar.shell.StellarShell\"` from `metron-platform/metron-common` and try the following strings:\r\n* `'\\'foo\\''` should yield `'foo'`\r\n* `\"\\\"foo\\\"\"` should yield `\"foo\"`\r\n* `TO_UPPER('\\'foo\\'')` should yield `'FOO'`\r\n* `TO_UPPER(\"\\\"foo\\\"\")` should yield `\"FOO\"`\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron (Incubating).  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? If not one needs to be created at [Metron Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON/?selectedTab=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:summary-panel). \r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with METRON-XXXX where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically master)?\r\n\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [x] Have you included steps to reproduce the behavior or problem that is being changed or addressed?\r\n- [x] Have you included steps or a guide to how the change may be verified and tested manually?\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests and checks have been executed in the root incubating-metron folder via:\r\n  ```\r\n  mvn -q clean integration-test install && build_utils/verify_licenses.sh \r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests and or integration tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [x] Have you verified the basic functionality of the build by building and running locally with Vagrant full-dev environment or the equivalent?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered by building and verifying the site-book? If not then run the following commands and the verify changes via `site-book/target/site/index.html`:\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n  cd site-book\r\n  bin/generate-md.sh\r\n  mvn site:site\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n####

Contributor Comments\r\nCurrently we have the ability to filter packets in the pcap query tool by header information (src/dest ip/port). We should be able to filter by binary regex on the packets themselves.\r\n\r\nProbably the state of the art and the goal to get to here is integration with [Yara](https://virustotal.github.io/yara/), but I'd like to iterate toward that solution for a couple of reasons:\r\n* Yara is hard to integrate with in our stack.\r\n  * It's C and, while the [yara-java](https://github.com/p8a/yara-java) project does exist, it would make the build a bit of a pain and no longer platform agnostic (i.e. you'd have to build certain modules against the machines that you're running in the cluster).  There are paths through that for sure, but it's more than I wanted to tackle just now.\r\n* The core abstraction for the obvious integration yara-java is running yara over a file, not a byte array.  This would necessitate taking the performance penalty with JNI AND writing out every packet to a temporary file, then deleting it, in the MR job.  I did not deem that a sensible approach.\r\n* Yara is a whole language, similar to stellar.  The point of integration would be as a proper `org.apache.metron.pcap.filter.PcapFilter`, not as a portion of an existing one.\r\n\r\nThat lead me to look for a stop-gap that was simpler and had the following characteristics:\r\n* Worked within Java easily\r\n* Was permissively licensed\r\n* Functioned on byte arrays\r\n* Could do both hex regex as well as interpreting the byte array as a string (similar to Yara)\r\n\r\n[bytestream](https://github.com/nishihatapalmer/byteseek) ( an all java regex library that functions on byte arrays, not files) fit the bill without eating all of a full-on Yara integration and fit within our core abstractions better.  \r\n\r\nAs such, the approach that I took is to provide the capability both of the packet filters that we currently have in place:\r\n* Fixed via a new command line option `--packet_filter` or `-pf` wherein you pass the binary regex.\r\n  * This would restrict to a single pattern\r\n* Query via a new Stellar function `BYTEARRAY_MATCHER(pattern, packet)`\r\n  * This allows you to compose multiple filters with logic operations to get a closer to Yara-esque feel via Stellar\r\n\r\nI have made a follow-on task to integrate with Yara at [METRON-871](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-871).\r\n\r\nTesting plan will be in the comments.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron (Incubating).  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nNOTE:\r\n* This is not an indication of graduation status.\r\n* I did not change any link to the archives of our lists on the website.\r\n\r\nTo test this:\r\n* Spin up full-dev and make sure things still work (I touched one python file, but I think it's fine).\r\n* Spin up the website from this PR and make sure no incubator logos or other indication of incubation.\r\n* Generate the docs and ensure they contain no indication of incubation\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron (Incubating).

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR enables the REST application to function in a Kerberized cluster.  Testing instructions are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Follow the instructions in /incubator-metron/metron-deployment/vagrant/Kerberos-setup.md to Kerberize Metron in full dev.\r\n2. Follow the instructions in the \"Quick Dev\" section of /incubator-metron/metron-interface/metron-rest/README.md to deploy and start the REST application \"locally on the Quick Dev host\" (full dev host in this case).  Make sure you use the start command for a Kerberos enabled cluster (the one with the -Djava.security.auth.login.config parameter).\r\n3. Navigate to http://node1:8082/swagger-ui.html and exercise the various endpoints.  The endpoints should function normally and there should be no security-related errors returned.\r\n\r\nThe REST application uses keytabs to authenticate the various services.  A summary of where these come from for each service:\r\n- Kafka and Zookeeper principals/keytabs come from the client_jaas.conf file created during Kerberos setup\r\n- HDFS and Storm principals/keytabs come from the Spring kerberos.principal and kerberos.keytab properties (should there be separate properties for each service?)\r\n\r\nUnit tests were added for new Kerberos related code but integration tests still assume a non-Kerberized testing environment.  I believe adjusting our integration testing framework to support Kerberos is out of scope for this PR and I'm not sure it's even possible.\r\n\r\nThis was also tested for regressions against a non-Kerberized cluster (start command is differently obviously).\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron (Incubating).  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis is motivated by the fact that if one sets the acl's on the znodes that metron creates (e.g. /metron/topology/global) to read/write by metron (from the zkcli `setAcl /metron/topology/global sasl:metron:crwda`), then permissions prohibit the CLI tools from functioning because the JAAS config is not loaded.\r\n\r\nThis JIRA allows users to pass java properties to the CLI tools. While important for Kerberos, it's useful in general if one needs to adjust the heap required, etc.\r\n\r\nTo exercise this, do the following:\r\n* Perform steps 1 through 17 of the [kerberos docs for vagrant](https://github.com/apache/incubator-metron/blob/master/metron-deployment/vagrant/Kerberos-setup.md)\r\n* su to the metron user via `su - metron`\r\n* Validate that you can dump the configs via `$METRON_HOME/bin/zk_load_configs.sh -m DUMP -z node1`\r\n* Adjust the ACL for `/metron/topology/global` by\r\n  * start zkcli by running `/usr/hdp/current/zookeeper-client/zookeeper-client -server node1`\r\n  * adjust the acl via `setAcl /metron/topology/global sasl:metron:crwda`\r\n* Destroy all existing tickets via `kdestroy`\r\n* Validate that `$METRON_HOME/bin/zk_load_configs.sh -m DUMP -z node1` gives an error\r\n* Validate that `JVMFLAGS=\"-Djava.security.auth.login.config=/home/metron/.storm/client_jaas.conf\" $METRON_HOME/bin/zk_load_configs.sh -m DUMP -z node1` works\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron (Incubating).  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

changes fix the following significant bugs:\r\n* metron-deployment/packaging/ambari/metron-mpack/src/main/resources/common-services/ELASTICSEARCH/2.3.3/configuration/elastic-sysconfig.xml\r\n  * Fixes necessary for Centos7: PID_DIR and JAVA_HOME added for systemd launch\r\n* metron-deployment/packaging/ambari/metron-mpack/src/main/resources/common-services/ELASTICSEARCH/2.3.3/package/scripts/elastic.py\r\n  * fix permissions on scripts directory\r\n  * fix elastic_group usage (missed one in previous patch)\r\n  * remove incorrect and spurious use of undefined format() method\r\n* metron-deployment/packaging/ambari/metron-mpack/src/main/resources/common-services/ELASTICSEARCH/2.3.3/package/scripts/elastic_master.py\r\n* metron-deployment/packaging/ambari/metron-mpack/src/main/resources/common-services/ELASTICSEARCH/2.3.3/package/scripts/elastic_slave.py\r\n  * remove incorrect and spurious uses of undefined format() method\r\n* metron-deployment/packaging/ambari/metron-mpack/src/main/resources/common-services/ELASTICSEARCH/2.3.3/configuration/elastic-site.xml\r\n  * Fix default value of \"network_host\" (ie network binding names), which breaks in some envs\r\n\r\nAlso the following minor issue corrections and description/comment improvements are made:\r\n* metron-deployment/packaging/ambari/metron-mpack/src/main/resources/common-services/ELASTICSEARCH/2.3.3/package/scripts/params.py\r\n  * fix incorrect override of pid_dir and pid_file, which are correctly defined in elastic-env.xml and ELASTICSEARCH status_params.py\r\n* metron-deployment/packaging/ambari/metron-mpack/src/main/resources/common-services/ELASTICSEARCH/2.3.3/metainfo.xml\r\n* metron-deployment/packaging/ambari/metron-mpack/src/main/resources/common-services/ELASTICSEARCH/2.3.3/quicklinks/quicklinks.json\r\n  * Add quicklinks to Elastic page in Ambari, for ES health status page and indexes list page; very useful for debugging the install.\r\n* metron-deployment/packaging/ambari/metron-mpack/src/main/resources/common-services/ELASTICSEARCH/2.3.3/configuration/elastic-site.xml\r\n* metron-deployment/packaging/ambari/metron-mpack/src/main/resources/common-services/METRON/CURRENT/configuration/metron-env.xml\r\n  * Non-substantive changes to descriptions or comments, meant to improve usability.\r\n  * Also an ordering change and add newline at end of file.\r\n\r\nThese fixes are only the first half of METRON-634.  The second half cause changes to the Ambari database, and therefore require an update script.  These will be done in a separate PR, when I have time to do it.  The changes here are stand-alone improvements.\r\n\r\n## Contributor Comments\r\nThese issues were worked out over several weeks of working with Mpack on Centos7, and documented in METRON-634.  @dlyle65535 adopted some into the Ansible work, but most remain to be done.\r\n\r\nThey have been tested manually, and through a full run of integration test.  If you are running Centos7, you will only notice the bug fixes as smoother startup of Elasticsearch.\r\n\r\nThe description improvements make it easier for manual users of Mpack Ambari install.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nThe pr. introduces an extension system for metron, along with refactoring the metron parsers on top of it.  This is the base work for METRON-258 - Sideloading parsers, which is to follow,  as it enables the creation and management of extensions outside of the metron codebase.  The work for enabling side loading is the ability to install and deploy 3rd party extensions/parsers.\r\n\r\nThere is a lot that can be done with this, but I could nibble at it forever, and I'd like to get feedback and improvements going.  There is still more documentation work that can be done for example.\r\n\r\nThe areas of change:\r\n\r\n### Travis\r\n- Building requires a VM instead of a container - requires : sudo\r\n\r\n### Metron Maven Bundle Plugin\r\n- adaptation of the nifi plugin\r\n- more configurable wrt file extension/dependency and metadata naming\r\n- new pre-build step on clean systems to install plugin\r\n\r\n### bundle-lib\r\n~~My goal here was not to make any radical changes~~.  If you want the diff, I would suggest cloning nifi latest and diffing this module with [nifi-nar_utils](https://github.com/apache/nifi/tree/master/nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-framework-bundle/nifi-framework/nifi-nar-utils)\r\n\r\n - adaptation of nifi-nar-utils to be used outside of the nifi project\r\n - rudimentary extensibility to allow configuration and injection of service types and other things that were hard coded to nifi \r\n - refactored from File based to VFS based\r\n - introduced class cluster for FileUtils to allow for specialized HDFS file functionality ( HDFS with VFS is read only )\r\n - rebranding to Bundle from Nar ( although the lib and the plugin allow that to be configured now )\r\n - added capability to the properties class to write to stream, adapted to uri from paths\r\n - added integration tests for hdfs\r\n - changed to be ClassIndex based instead of ServiceLoader.  Service loader is slower, and Casey's ClassIndex work is great.  This also removes the NAR's required manual maintenance of the service file.\r\n- refactored to use VFS to load the bundle/nar into the classloader **AND**  to use VFS to load the dependency jars -> VFS as a composite filesystem.  Thus going from NAR's 'working directory', exploded NARS to just loading the bundle/nar.\r\n\r\n### Metron Maven Parser Extension Archetype\r\n - locally installable archetype for creating Metron Parsers\r\n - <provided> dependencies instead of shading\r\n - builds Bundle\r\n - creates an assembly with bundle and configuration\r\n - configuration for parsers now includes all parser related configurations ( except ES and Logrotate )\r\n - Includes sample data for testing, global config etc. ( such that you don't need metron code to build and test ).\r\n - Can be used with configuration only parsers, so that you can still unit and integration test them, common deployment\r\n - Creates documentation readme.\r\n\r\n### Metron-Platform/Metron-Extensions / Metron-Parser-Extensions/**\r\n- Module area for extensions, first extension type is parsers\r\n- All parsers re-based on archetype generated projects\r\n- All parser test data/ configuration located with parser ( see above )\r\n- Each parser had a readme that should be filled out, but I didn't do that\r\n[note - during integration tests, the parsers are found in the system classloader not the bundles, because the way the tests are tied together]\r\n\r\n### Bundle Extension Test\r\n - added a separate test to test loading parsers without any dependency\r\n### Metron-Parsers\r\n - Removed all parsers and their tests etc except CSV, JSON, GROK\r\n - Still shaded, still the storm loaded jar\r\n - extended or fix tests so that they work when derived outside of code tree\r\n - Parser bolt no longer takes MessageParser<> instance, loads it as from extension/bundle system\r\n - MessageParser<> annotated for  ClassIndex\r\n\r\n### Metron-configuration\r\n - changes to support new parser locations\r\n - added functionality to load and store bundle.properties to zk\r\n\r\n### Metron Tests\r\n - Extended to work with relative path / formatted paths\r\n\r\n### RPM-Build\r\n - Copy all the parser extensions\r\n - Include in the spec\r\n\r\n/usr/metron/V/ now has a new directories for extensions:\r\n\r\n/extension_etc/PARSER_NAME/  -> that parser's configuration\r\n/extension_alt_etc/ -> location for 3rd Party extension configuration\r\n/extension_lib -> location on disk for rpm to place bundles\r\n/extension_alt_lib -> location on disk for staging 3rd party bundles\r\n\r\n### METRON-SERVICE ambari\r\n - Load zk configurations for parsers from their location\r\n - filles out the properties template and deploys to hdfs\r\n - create HDFS directories\r\n - deploy/copy bundles to HDFS\r\n\r\n### the metron workflow that this enables\r\nWe need a new parser:\r\n*create with archetype under metron-extensions/metron-parser-extensions\r\n*implement including tests and test data, all configurations\r\n*add to the copy-resources of RPM-Docker pom\r\n*add to the spec file\r\n*add to the all_parsers variable in params\r\n - this will get it installed but not started, no ES no log rotate\r\n* add to parsers variable in the env.xml to get it to start as well ( still no ES or Log rotate )\r\n* other steps to get the ES template integrated with indexing scripts and log rotate with ansible\r\n\r\nI have been working in Full Dev to get this going, and I believe it is working enough to get this started.\r\nAt the end of vagrant up with full dev, you should have data in kibana, as if nothing had changed ;)\r\n\r\nThere are issues however:\r\nI have not integrated this with the Metron Docker project, I'm not sure how yet.\r\nI have fixed Metron-Interface to get the test to run, but I think that work needs to be done there.\r\n\r\nThe next steps here are follow ons for installing parsers from the ui.\r\n\r\nTesting:\r\n-   Build with tests works\r\n-   Start full_dev_platform and confirm parsers are installed and working as expected\r\n-   Management UI confirm that all 14 parsers are installed and available\r\n-   Ensure the UI can spin up the squid parser\r\n-   Follow the metron-platform/metron-extensions/metron-parser-extensions/ADDING_SYSTEM_PARSERS.md guide\r\n\r\nI am sure I missed many things, and that there are things that could be better.

replaced all effective Metron version strings, from \"0.3.2\" to \"0.4.0\".\r\nUsed `mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=0.4.0` first, then did\r\n```\r\nfor f in `grep -r -l \"0\\.3\\.1\" * | egrep -v '^site/'` ; do  echo \" \"; echo $f; grep \"0\\.3\\.1\" $f; done\r\n```\r\nto catch the non-maven files, and hand-edited them.\r\nThe remaining handful of .md and log files containing \"0.3.2\" are not effective Metron versions, but recordings of previous uses, so they are not changed.\r\n\r\nNOTE: The new branch has not propagated to github, presumably because only commits stimulate the propagation, and a new branch copied from existing master is not technically a commit.  So we are using this low-risk commit to cause that propagation, even though it needs a few more hours to run full tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

PR makes the necessary changes for Pycapa to work in a Kerberized environment.  \r\n* The previous Kafka client library used by Pycapa did not support Kerberos.  Switched to another that supports Kerberos and is based on librdkafka, which is the same library used by Fastcapa and the Bro Plugin.\r\n* Added docs on how to install and setup Pycapa for Kerberos.\r\n* Added lots of additional docs around usage.\r\n\r\nI tested this change on plain-vanilla Quick Dev, a kerberized-Quick Dev and also a bare-metal cluster that is using Kerberos.  \r\n\r\nValidation\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThe following steps can be used to validate the PR.\r\n\r\n1. Launch the \"Full Dev\" environment.\r\n\r\n1. Follow the Kerberos instructions to Kerberize the environment.  You only need to complete the following sections:\r\n     * [Setup](https://github.com/apache/incubator-metron/blob/master/metron-deployment/vagrant/Kerberos-setup.md#setup)\r\n     * [Create a KDC](https://github.com/apache/incubator-metron/blob/master/metron-deployment/vagrant/Kerberos-setup.md#create-a-kdc)\r\n     * [Enable Kerberos](https://github.com/apache/incubator-metron/blob/master/metron-deployment/vagrant/Kerberos-setup.md#enable-kerberos)\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Grant the `metron` principal access to a topic named `pcap`.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    kinit -kt /etc/security/keytabs/metron.headless.keytab metron@EXAMPLE.COM\r\n\r\n    ${KAFKA_HOME}/bin/kafka-topics.sh \\\r\n      --zookeeper node1:2181 \\\r\n      --create \\\r\n      --topic pcap \\\r\n      --partitions 1 \\\r\n      --replication-factor 1\r\n     \r\n    ${KAFKA_HOME}/bin/kafka-acls.sh \\\r\n      --authorizer kafka.security.auth.SimpleAclAuthorizer \\\r\n      --authorizer-properties zookeeper.connect=node1:2181 \\\r\n      --add \\\r\n      --allow-principal User:metron \\\r\n      --topic pcap\r\n\r\n    ${KAFKA_HOME}/bin/kafka-acls.sh \\\r\n      --authorizer kafka.security.auth.SimpleAclAuthorizer \\\r\n      --authorizer-properties zookeeper.connect=node1:2181 \\\r\n      --add \\\r\n      --allow-principal User:metron \\\r\n      --group pycapa\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Install system dependencies including the core development tools, Python libraries and header files, and Libpcap libraries and header files.  \r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    yum -y install centos-release-scl\r\n    yum -y install \"@Development tools\" libpcap-devel python27 python27-scldevel python27-python-virtualenv\r\n    yum install -y cyrus-sasl cyrus-sasl-devel cyrus-sasl-gssapi\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Install Librdkafka with SASL enabled.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    wget https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka/archive/v0.9.4.tar.gz  -O - | tar -xz\r\n    cd librdkafka-0.9.4/\r\n    ./configure --prefix=/usr --enable-sasl\r\n    make\r\n    make install\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Validate that Librdkafka does indeed support SASL. Run the following command and ensure that `sasl` is returned as a built-in feature.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    $ examples/rdkafka_example -X builtin.features\r\n    builtin.features = snappy,sasl,regex\r\n    ```\r\n    \r\n1. Add Librdkafka to our default load path.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    echo \"/usr/lib\" >> /etc/ld.so.conf.d/pycapa.conf\r\n    ldconfig -v\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Fetch the code from this PR. \r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    cd ~\r\n    git clone https://github.com/apache/incubator-metron\r\n    cd incubator-metron\r\n    git pull origin pull/524/head\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Setup a virtual environment so that we can run Pycapa under Python 2.7.  Only needed because the base OS here is CentOS 6.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    export PY27=/opt/rh/python27/root\r\n    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$PY27/usr/lib64\r\n    \r\n    mkdir /usr/local/pycapa\r\n    cd /usr/local/pycapa\r\n    $PY27/usr/bin/virtualenv pycapa-venv\r\n    \r\n    export VENV=/usr/local/pycapa/pycapa-venv/\r\n    ```\r\n    \r\n    \r\n1. Build and install Pycapa.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    cp -r ~/incubator-metron/metron-sensors/pycapa/ .\r\n    cd /usr/local/pycapa/pycapa\r\n    \r\n    $VENV/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt\r\n    $VENV/bin/python setup.py install\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Use Pycapa in 'consumer-mode' which will fetch packets already landed in Kafka. This will not do anything until we inject some packets in the next step.  Leave this running in the current shell.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    $VENV/bin/pycapa --consumer \\\r\n      --kafka-broker node1:6667 \\\r\n      --kafka-topic pcap \\\r\n      --pretty-print 1 \\\r\n      -X security.protocol=SASL_PLAINTEXT \\\r\n      -X sasl.kerberos.keytab=/etc/security/keytabs/metron.headless.keytab \\\r\n      -X sasl.kerberos.principal=metron@EXAMPLE.COM \\\r\n      -X group.id=pycapa\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Open a second shell and use Pycapa in 'consumer mode' to capture a few packets and throw those into Kafka.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    export PY27=/opt/rh/python27/root\r\n    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$PY27/usr/lib64\r\n    export VENV=/usr/local/pycapa/pycapa-venv/\r\n    \r\n    $VENV/bin/pycapa --producer \\\r\n      --interface eth1 \\\r\n      --kafka-broker node1:6667 \\\r\n      --kafka-topic pcap \\\r\n      --pretty-print 1 \\\r\n      --max-packets 5 \\\r\n      -X security.protocol=SASL_PLAINTEXT \\\r\n      -X sasl.kerberos.keytab=/etc/security/keytabs/metron.headless.keytab \\\r\n      -X sasl.kerberos.principal=metron@EXAMPLE.COM \r\n    ```\r\n    \r\n1. In the original shell, where Pycapa was running in 'consumer-mode' you should see the packets.  It should look-like the following.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    ....\r\n    \r\n    Packet: count=1 date=2017-04-19 21:07:08.345337 topic=pcap\r\n    08 00 27 f6 b0 07 52 54 00 12 35 02 08 00 45 00\r\n    00 4c 1e 04 00 00 40 06 44 98 0a 00 02 02 0a 00\r\n    02 0f db 13 00 16 12 91 0b b7 b1 79 ee fe 50 18\r\n    ff ff 18 3d 00 00 7b 55 37 93 46 b8 8f fe 98 e0\r\n    10 f3 42 53 06 51 6d 8b 4c d1 45 07 ea 51 57 58\r\n    6b d2 67 74 75 d7 fd 1d e2 0e\r\n    Packet: count=2 date=2017-04-19 21:07:08.345884 topic=pcap\r\n    52 54 00 12 35 02 08 00 27 f6 b0 07 08 00 45 10\r\n    00 b4 09 68 40 00 40 06 18 bc 0a 00 02 0f 0a 00\r\n    02 02 00 16 db 13 b1 79 ee fe 12 91 0b db 50 18\r\n    59 80 18 b7 00 00 d3 b3 9b fb 2b 4a 70 57 d6 49\r\n    d6 ab 7c 26 7d cd 87 9b 41 27 50 f4 94 45 3f 0c\r\n    58 c3 31 24 79 9a 0a 96 9a df d3 17 75 43 76 5d\r\n    ed 07 74 f1 b7 bb aa 0c 38 72 0a 58 e4 2d a9 02\r\n    b6 e8 83 e7 3b 95 04 78 30 d4 a5 de 54 94 be 2d\r\n    10 08 08 b1 27 e1 ba 9e b7 74 b4 12 a5 3a 5e de\r\n    39 fb 5b 97 c7 07 4a 10 4f e9 ba 59 42 1d 65 c3\r\n    0d 04 22 30 62 ce 56 d1 20 06 0f 6b 73 09 82 c9\r\n    cb 4c 6c 7e 3f 50 ac 7c 26 83 0a 47 d8 ef 44 39\r\n    f7 b6\r\n    Packet: count=3 date=2017-04-19 21:07:08.346004 topic=pcap\r\n    52 54 00 12 35 02 08 00 27 f6 b0 07 08 00 45 10\r\n    00 4c 09 69 40 00 40 06 19 23 0a 00 02 0f 0a 00\r\n    02 02 00 16 db 13 b1 79 ef 8a 12 91 0b db 50 18\r\n    59 80 18 4f 00 00 37 f4 72 54 28 a5 14 ed 5a 4a\r\n    1f b0 f0 7d 0d be 94 a4 b0 54 a3 2f d7 3a 00 41\r\n    59 fe 13 28 18 88 5a 84 b9 44\r\n    Packet: count=4 date=2017-04-19 21:07:08.346051 topic=pcap\r\n    08 00 27 f6 b0 07 52 54 00 12 35 02 08 00 45 00\r\n    00 28 1e 05 00 00 40 06 44 bb 0a 00 02 02 0a 00\r\n    02 0f db 13 00 16 12 91 0b db b1 79 ef 8a 50 10\r\n    ff ff fd 29 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\r\n    Packet: count=5 date=2017-04-19 21:07:08.346288 topic=pcap\r\n    08 00 27 f6 b0 07 52 54 00 12 35 02 08 00 45 00\r\n    00 28 1e 06 00 00 40 06 44 ba 0a 00 02 02 0a 00\r\n    02 0f db 13 00 16 12 91 0b db b1 79 ef ae 50 10\r\n    ff ff fd 05 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nAllows the Ambari Kerberos wizard to handle Metron setup.\r\n\r\nChanges include:\r\n- Creation of Keytabs\r\n- Running everything as the Metron user, including Storm topology workers (on a Kerberized cluster).\r\n- Setup for Metron user to actually be able to run (client_jaas setup, home Storm dir setup, etc.)\r\n- Adjusting perms to 0755.  The exception is the HDFS output folder on a non-kerb cluster is left as 0775 because we don't have Storm running workers as metron user on.  When Kerberizing, the permissions will be restricted down to 0755.\r\n- Kafka ACLs\r\n- HBase ACLs\r\n- Refactored Topic creation to use a common function so I didn't have to edit the same thing 3 times.\r\n- Automated updating of Storm configs (the AutoTGT and running workers as user)\r\n\r\nThere's still more testing I want to do, but this is definitely far enough along to submit a PR.\r\n\r\nI've spun this up on full dev with the now modified Kerberos setup instructions, with the caveat that Ambari's Storm service check fails (it's harmless, as far as I can tell).  See below for more details.  As this does not touch the sensors, data will need to be pushed manually (same as the old instructions).  I've been able to push data from Kafka to Elasticsearch/HDFS.\r\n\r\n### The Bad News\r\nI would love insight on a problem, if anybody has some.  I haven't edited the docs to reflect this yet, in the hopes it'll be resolved.\r\n\r\nStorm's service check will fail during (and after) Kerberization.  Metron can immediately be started perfectly fine.  Nothing is legit wrong, but this setup means that the storm user is unable to submit to the cluster (it doesn't have it's home directory setup with some configs).  Unfortunately, Ambari runs the service check as the storm user.\r\n\r\nThis can be worked around by creating ~storm/.storm/storm.yaml\r\n```\r\nnimbus.seeds : ['node1']\r\njava.security.auth.login.config : '/usr/hdp/current/storm-supervisor/conf/storm_jaas.conf'\r\nstorm.thrift.transport : 'org.apache.storm.security.auth.kerberos.KerberosSaslTransportPlugin\r\n```\r\n`java.security.auth.login.conf` can also be `/etc/storm/conf/storm_jaas.conf`, but the value above leads me to my next point.  All of these values already exist in storm.yaml.  The fact that they need to be specified again in the user's home is really strange. And it'll give an error that the TGT found is not renewable, not something you'd expected.\r\n\r\nI'm unsure if there are restrictions on where Ambari chooses to run service check, so it's possible this would have to be setup on every node Storm lives on the cluster. I'm also unsure if we can actually have Ambari automate this if it turns out to be necessary, since we aren't the Storm service.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron (Incubating).  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nTo enable use-cases where the user may want to do simple iteration, we can expose simple functional primitives such as:\r\n* `MAP`\r\n* `REDUCE`\r\n* `FILTER`\r\nTo fully support this, we will need lambda expressions as arguments to these functions.\r\n\r\nI also added a simple `LIST_ADD` to enable better testing of the functions and because it was an easy-to-fill gap.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron (Incubating).  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-827\r\n\r\nI was experiencing issues spinning up full dev 2x in a row. The observed behavior was for me to see old code deployed in RPMs the first run, and no RPMs in the build output or in /localrepo on the VM during the second run. I believe this may have been a race condition introduced when we added `-T 2C` for multi-threading the build to the \"build metron artifacts\" Ansible task. Since the projects had no explicit dependency, the ordering may not have been consistent from run to run and machine to machine. To address this, I've added pom dependencies for the metron-deployment project on metron-platform and metron-analytics.\r\n\r\nTest by spinning up full-dev.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron (Incubating).  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nCurrently, if you attempt to build the site-book on master you get the following error:\r\n```\r\nERROR OR ERRORS DETECTED:\r\nERROR: Header specification character (#) detected with indenting.  This is presumed to be an error, since it will render as text. If intentional, put a period or other printable character before it.\r\non line: 16 in file: ./metron-sensors/bro-plugin-kafka/index.md\r\n    # curl -L https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka/archive/v0.9.4.tar.gz | tar xvz\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn order to fix this I changed `metron-sensors/bro-plugin-kafka/index.md` to use triple backticks instead of indentation to indicate the code block.  This allows it to parse properly in GitHub MD as well as our Doxia site-book docs.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron (Incubating).  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nAs I ran through Kerberos-setup.md I found [one minor issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-metron/blame/eb209f5c9400b81720a866ef5dd1817f73226f44/metron-deployment/vagrant/Kerberos-setup.md#L138), so I figured that if I was going to make a change I might as well make some other adjustments.  \r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron (Incubating).  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development

PR contains significant improvements to the performance and scalability of Fastcapa.  \r\n\r\n* Previously the 'distributor' framework was used.  This did not scale well and has been replaced with a burst-oriented design.\r\n* Receive and transmission functions have been separated to allow each to scale independently.\r\n* Additional parameters have been added to allow the process to be tuned easily.\r\n* Output provides basic transparency into the current state of processing.\r\n* If the probe is overwhelmed with more packets than can be handled, it will continue processing the packets that it can without crashing.  \r\n* The fact that packets are being dropped is very clear.\r\n* A great deal of documentation has been added to the README.\r\n* Support for latest release of DPDK; v16.11.1\r\n* Support for latest release of RdKafka; v0.9.4\r\n\r\nThis change has been tested on Cisco UCS hardware with a 10G Cisco VNIC.  The probe was able to capture 1 gbps before packets started to drop.  Additional performance tuning would push this ceiling much higher, but for my purposes, I just needed to reach 1 gbps.  Additional work will proceed in the future to find its true performance ceiling.\r\n\r\nTo test the change yourself, simply spin-up the virtualized test environment which will deploy and validate that Fastcapa can land packets in Kafka correctly.\r\n```\r\ncd metron-deployment/vagrant/fastcapa-test-environment\r\nvagrant up\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n-

Contributor Comments\r\nWe recreate StellarProcessor objects all over the place which do not reuse their expression caches. This results in a significant performance regression as we are compiling the expression and then processing for every message, rather than compiling once and reusing.\r\n\r\nAs far as testing, unit tests cover this functionality quite a bit.  Also, a smoke-test with vagrant is in order (i.e. ensuring data flows through the topology) with a field transformation and a stellar enrichment set.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron (Incubating).  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nPrimarily this affects HdfsWriter by changing the output path from a set path (`/apps/metron/.../<sensor>`), and allow it to be defined via a Stellar Function.  Specifically, the base path is still defined the same (The `/apps/metron/.../` portion), but the `<sensor>` portion is dropped and can now be defined by a Stellar function.  By default, the original behavior of `<sensor>` is used.  This is defined in the `<sensor>.json` file as indicated in the new README.md for metron-writer.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n- This requires adding tracking things a bit more carefully (and if you're reviewing, please validate that it happens correctly).  When the outputFile is closed, we remove the sourceHandler from HdfsWriter's map.\r\n  - I'm slightly concerned about the correctness of the implementation, but it seems necessary to ensure that we don't leave a bunch of SourceHandlers lying around as data changes (and we don't want an enormous number of output files being written to).\r\n  - If there's a cleaner way to manage this, I'd love to hear it and can refactor pretty easily. It throws off the rotation count (because we kill the SourceHandler from the map itself), but I doubt we care about that since it really only shows up in the output filename anyway.\r\n- This also adds an argument for max open files.  This is a flux level config. I defaulted this to 500.  500 was chosen because it was an arbitrary round number that wasn't enormous.\r\n  - If someone has a default with any real reasoning behind it, I'll go ahead and change it.\r\n- In HdfsWriter, we iterate through the messages, apply the Stellar function and then call the relevant handler. The entire group of message is treated as one single pass/fail (which is the same as the old behavior), rather than individually. The try/catch could potentially be moved into the for loop, but I don't think there's an explicit link between the message and the tuples that we can exploit to fail per message.  I don't think it needs to be addressed here, but I'm curious if there's thought on this.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nUnit tests are added to pretty much cover HdfsWriter, and this can be spun up in a dev environment.\r\n\r\nTo test in dev\r\n\r\n- Spin up a dev environment\r\n- Validate that the output matches the old format in HDFS (Nothing has an output function defined)\r\n  ```\r\n  [hdfs@node1 vagrant]$ hdfs dfs -ls /apps/metron/indexing/indexed/\r\n  Found 3 items\r\n  drwxrwxr-x   - storm hadoop          0 2017-04-03 13:11 /apps/metron/indexing/indexed/bro\r\n  drwxrwxr-x   - storm hadoop          0 2017-04-03 13:11 /apps/metron/indexing/indexed/error\r\n  drwxrwxr-x   - storm hadoop          0 2017-04-03 13:11 /apps/metron/indexing/indexed/snort\r\n  ```\r\n- Edit the indexing config for Bro to include an outputPathFunction in the hdfs section, e.g. in `/usr/metron/0.3.1/config/zookeeper/indexing/bro.json`\r\n  ```\r\n  {\r\n    \"hdfs\" : {\r\n      \"index\": \"bro\",\r\n      \"batchSize\": 5,\r\n      \"enabled\" : true,\r\n      \"outputPathFunction\": \"FORMAT('ipsrc-%s', ip_src_addr)\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"elasticsearch\" : {\r\n      \"index\": \"bro\",\r\n      \"batchSize\": 5,\r\n      \"enabled\" : true\r\n    },\r\n    \"solr\" : {\r\n      \"index\": \"bro\",\r\n      \"batchSize\": 5,\r\n      \"enabled\" : true\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n- Push the config configs to ZooKeeper: `/usr/metron/0.3.1/bin/zk_load_configs.sh -z node1:2181 -m PUSH -i /usr/metron/0.3.1/config/zookeeper/`\r\n- Let some more data run through and check the output folders, e.g.\r\n  ```\r\n  [hdfs@node1 vagrant]$ hdfs dfs -ls /apps/metron/indexing/indexed/\r\n  Found 5 items\r\n  drwxrwxr-x   - storm hadoop          0 2017-04-03 13:11 /apps/metron/indexing/indexed/bro\r\n  drwxrwxr-x   - storm hadoop          0 2017-04-03 13:11 /apps/metron/indexing/indexed/error\r\n  drwxrwxr-x   - storm hadoop          0 2017-04-03 13:14 /apps/metron/indexing/indexed/ipsrc-192.168.138.158\r\n  drwxrwxr-x   - storm hadoop          0 2017-04-03 13:14 /apps/metron/indexing/indexed/ipsrc-192.168.66.1\r\n  drwxrwxr-x   - storm hadoop          0 2017-04-03 13:11 /apps/metron/indexing/indexed/snort\r\n  [hdfs@node1 vagrant]$ hdfs dfs -ls /apps/metron/indexing/indexed/ipsrc-192.168.138.158\r\n  Found 1 items\r\n  -rw-r--r--   1 storm hadoop     223182 2017-04-03 13:14 /apps/metron/indexing/indexed/ipsrc-  192.168.138.158/enrichment-null-0-0-1491225291377.json\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron (Incubating).  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

You can also investigate errors in the [storm topology](http://node1:8744/) \"bro\" under parserBolt.\r\n\r\nThis changes SEARCH and REPLACE so that the timestamp is only updated to the latest second and the decimals are untouched.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron (Incubating).  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR adds the metron-rest module to the Ambari MPack.  This can be tested by building the rpms and mpack and spinning up full-dev-platform.  Once the ansible script has finished, navigate to \"Ambari > Services > Metron\" and there should be an additional \"Metron REST\" component in the Summary.  The \"Quick Links\" tab will have a link to the REST Swagger UI that should be functional if the service is running.  All the Ambari lifecycle commands should work.  I also tested starting/stopping the service with the \"service metron-rest start/stop\" commands and verified Ambari correctly reports status.\r\n\r\nI ran into an issue with rpmlint complaining about missing chkconfig calls:\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe package contains an init script but doesn't contain a %post with a call to\r\nchkconfig\r\n```\r\n\r\nI believe this is benign because Ambari managements the REST application lifecycle but I can't figure out how to suppress them yet.  Also considering adding a couple lines to the metron-rest README that references the MPack install path.  Credentials for the REST app are \"user/password\" (will also add that to the metron-rest README).\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron (Incubating).  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis changeset allows deployment with Ansible 2.0.0.2 and 2.2.2.0. \r\n\r\nI also added a version check as a pre-task to the top of the two entry playbooks, so deployment will now fail with a clearer error message if it is run on untested Ansible versions. \r\n\r\n@JonZeolla - this is the branch that (I hope) takes care of your issue. Please update Ansible to 2.2.2.0 and give it a whirl when you can. I setup a virtualenv to test it out, I'd recommend you do the same.\r\n\r\n**Testing**\r\nFor those wishing to remain on 2.0.0.2, nothing should change, simply run the deployment of your choice.\r\n\r\nFor those wishing to test on 2.2.2.0, do the following:\r\n\r\n1. Setup virtual environment for testing.\r\n\r\n```\r\npip install virtualenv\r\ncd ~\r\nvirtualenv -p /usr/bin/python2.7 test_ansible\r\nsource ~/test_ansible/bin/activate\r\npip install ansible\r\npip install boto\r\n```\r\nAfter this, your prompt will begin with (test_ansible) indicating you're in the virtual Python environment.\r\n\r\n2. Run deployment of your choosing.\r\n\r\n3. Type _deactivate_ to return to your normal Python environment. \r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron (Incubating).  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nMETRON-793 migrated the storm topologies to the storm-kafka-client spout, which supports kerberos. To complete the kerberos work on the existing topologies, we need to be able to enable the spouts and kafka writers to use security protocols other than PLAINTEXT. Also, enabling auto-renew plugins for storm will enable the topologies to run for extended durations in a kerberized cluster.\r\nNOTE: This does not encompass MPack changes to enable kerberos or fix the sensors to work with a kerberized kafka. That would be follow-on work.\r\n\r\nThis work was inspired by a portion of the investigatory work done at https://github.com/dlyle65535/incubator-metron/tree/kerb-testing?files=1 by:\r\n\r\n* @dlyle65535\r\n* @merrimanr\r\n* @mmiklavc\r\n\r\nThis carves out a specific piece of that functionality with the following differences:\r\n\r\nThe mpack work is not included, but the properties are set up to enable it as a follow-on\r\nIt presumes METRON-793, so it uses storm-kafka-client rather than storm-kafka\r\nIt adds a flag when starting the parsers to pass the security protocol and sets up the writers and the spout automatically rather than relying on the set of extra kafka configs (though both approaches would work here).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron (Incubating).  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nMETRON-793 migrated the storm topologies to the storm-kafka-client spout, which supports kerberos. To complete the kerberos work on the existing topologies, we need to be able to enable the spouts and kafka writers to use security protocols other than PLAINTEXT. Also, enabling auto-renew plugins for storm will enable the topologies to run for extended durations in a kerberized cluster.\r\nNOTE: This does not encompass MPack changes to enable kerberos or fix the sensors to work with a kerberized kafka. That would be follow-on work.\r\n\r\nThis work was inspired by a portion of the investigatory work done at https://github.com/dlyle65535/incubator-metron/tree/kerb-testing?files=1 by:\r\n* @dlyle65535 \r\n* @merrimanr \r\n* @mmiklavc \r\n\r\nThis carves out a specific piece of that functionality with the following differences:\r\n* The mpack work is not included, but the properties are set up to enable it as a follow-on\r\n* It presumes METRON-793, so it uses storm-kafka-client rather than storm-kafka\r\n* It adds a flag when starting the parsers to pass the security protocol and sets up the writers and the spout automatically rather than relying on the set of extra kafka configs (though both approaches would work here).\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE: This depends on METRON-793.  As such, this PR includes it, so do not merge until 793 is merged.\r\n\r\nAn acceptance test plan will follow as well as instructions for kerberizing vagrant and running the topologies in said environment.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron (Incubating).  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR includes the latest version of the Management UI.  Instructions for building and installing are located in metron-interface/metron-config/README.md.  \r\n\r\nHere are the commands I used to deploy to Quick Dev:\r\n\r\n1. Install REST application:\r\n```\r\nscp ./metron-interface/metron-rest/target/metron-rest-0.3.1-archive.tar.gz root@node1:/usr/metron/0.3.1/\r\nssh root@node1\r\ncd /usr/metron/0.3.1/\r\ntar -xf metron-rest-0.3.1-archive.tar.gz\r\njava -jar ./lib/metron-rest-0.3.1.jar --spring.profiles.active=vagrant,dev --server.port=8082\r\n```\r\n2. Install the Management UI:\r\n```\r\nscp ./metron-interface/metron-config/target/metron-config-0.3.1-archive.tar.gz root@node1:/usr/metron/0.3.1/\r\nssh root@node1\r\ncd /usr/metron/0.3.1/\r\ntar -xf metron-config-0.3.1-archive.tar.gz\r\nyum install -y npm\r\nnpm install npm@3.8.9 -g\r\nexport METRON_REST_URL=http://node1:8082\r\n./bin/start_management_ui.sh\r\n```\r\nThe UI should be available at http://node1:4200 (login with user/password).\r\n\r\nSo far this UI has only been dev tested and there will likely be some bugs found.  If reviewers feel they have found a critical bug that should be fixed before this can be accepted, please state that and we will address it ASAP.  Otherwise I will create Jiras for bugs/issues that can be done as follow on work.\r\n\r\nThis is a very large pull request that contains mostly client-side code.  The application was built on the [Angular 2](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/) framework using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).\r\n\r\nChanges that are outside of metron-interface/metron-config (Management UI module) include:\r\n\r\n- Addition of \"/api/v1/grok/get/statement\" REST endpoint that gets a grok statement from the classpath instead of HDFS\r\n- A couple fields added to the Storm topology status response (emitted and acked tuples)\r\n- Updated REST documentation\r\n- Apache Rat exclusions added to the top level pom.xml\r\n\r\nThere are a couple tasks still outstanding so don't merge until those are complete.  These tasks should not affect functional testing or code review.  They include:\r\n\r\n- add architectural documentation to the README\r\n\r\nI will keep the thread updated as these are completed.  Thanks for reviewing!\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron (Incubating).  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nReverts the group owner of a couple HDFS directories to be the hadoop group, rather than the metron group (which is just metron).  Right now, the topologies run as the storm user (which belongs to the hadoop group), and therefore didn't have permission to write to HDFS (including in quick and full dev).  This sets HDFS ownership to metron:hadoop, which lets it be handled appropriately.\r\n\r\nOther items, such as configs and installation files, were just left as the metron group.\r\n\r\nTo test, just run up a dev environment and ensure files are being written and ownership makes sense (/apps/metron/indexing/indexed is metron:hadoop with 755 perms).  The individual sensors will be owned by storm:hadoop (proving that writes work).\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```\r\n[vagrant@node1 ~]$ hdfs dfs -ls /apps/metron/indexing\r\nFound 1 items\r\ndrwxrwxr-x   - metron hadoop          0 2017-03-24 12:57 /apps/metron/indexing/indexed\r\n[vagrant@node1 ~]$ hdfs dfs -ls /apps/metron/indexing/indexed\r\nFound 3 items\r\ndrwxrwxr-x   - storm hadoop          0 2017-03-24 13:01 /apps/metron/indexing/indexed/bro\r\ndrwxrwxr-x   - storm hadoop          0 2017-03-24 13:01 /apps/metron/indexing/indexed/error\r\ndrwxrwxr-x   - storm hadoop          0 2017-03-24 13:01 /apps/metron/indexing/indexed/snort\r\n[vagrant@node1 ~]$ hdfs dfs -ls /apps/metron/indexing/indexed/bro\r\nFound 1 items\r\n-rw-r--r--   1 storm hadoop     211393 2017-03-24 13:01 /apps/metron/indexing/indexed/bro/enrichment-null-0-0-1490360489968.json\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs a note, metron_group existed twice in params_linux.py, so only the first instance is changed to hadoop_group and pulled appropriately.  The second is left as-is.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron (Incubating).  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nWhile building out METRON-671, I inadvertently omitted recreation of the RPM database for Quick Dev. As a result, stale RPMs are installed so, Quick Dev removes and then re-installs the same bits. \r\n\r\nThis fixes that. Now it clears out /localrepo and re-runs createrepo.\r\n\r\nTo test:\r\n\r\n- Merge this PR\r\n- Run _vagrant up_ from _project directory/metron-deployment/vagrant/quick-dev-platform_. \r\n- Once deployment is complete, _vagrant ssh_ to node1.\r\n- Verify that the RPMs in /localrepo are timestamped the same as those in _project directory/metron-deployment/packaging/docker/rpm-docker/RPMS/noarch_\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron (Incubating).  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

couple-line fix for the defaulting behavior.  The only non-comment line is changing the default from 5 to 1, and adding a validity check.  Found by inspection, and recommend checking the same.\r\n\r\nIf one is so inclined, you can do a before-and-after test by invoking\r\n```\r\nINDEXING_SET_BATCH('{}', 'hdfs')\r\n```\r\nin the REPL, leaving out the \"size\" argument (which is optional, even tho not documented as such).  Observe the returned JSON of the config, and see what the value of batchSize is.  Before this patch, it will be 5, after it will be 1.\r\n\r\nBTW, with @cestella 's help, we figured out you can invoke the REPL from the build environment with these steps:\r\n- build the whole project, eg with `mvn clean install -DskipTests`\r\n- cd metron-platform/metron-common\r\n- invoke:\r\n```\r\njava -cp ../metron-enrichment/target/metron-enrichment-0.3.1-uber.jar:../metron-data-management/target/metron-data-management-0.3.1.jar:target/metron-common-0.3.1.jar:../metron-management/target/metron-management-0.3.1.jar:../metron-parsers/target/metron-parsers-0.3.1-uber.jar org.apache.metron.common.stellar.shell.StellarShell\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron (Incubating).  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR includes the latest version of the Management UI.  Instructions for building and installing are located in metron-interface/metron-config/README.md.  \r\n\r\nHere are the commands I used to deploy to Quick Dev:\r\n\r\n1. Install REST application:\r\n```\r\nscp ./metron-interface/metron-rest/target/metron-rest-0.3.1-archive.tar.gz root@node1:/usr/metron/0.3.1/\r\nssh root@node1\r\ncd /usr/metron/0.3.1/\r\ntar -xf metron-rest-0.3.1-archive.tar.gz\r\njava -jar ./lib/metron-rest-0.3.1.jar --spring.profiles.active=vagrant,dev --server.port=8082\r\n```\r\n2. Install the Management UI:\r\n```\r\nscp ./metron-interface/metron-config/target/metron-config-0.3.1-archive.tar.gz root@node1:/usr/metron/0.3.1/\r\nssh root@node1\r\ncd /usr/metron/0.3.1/\r\ntar -xf metron-config-0.3.1-archive.tar.gz\r\nyum install -y npm\r\nnpm install npm@3.8.9 -g\r\nexport METRON_REST_URL=http://node1:8082\r\n./bin/start_management_ui.sh\r\n```\r\nThe UI should be available at http://node1:4200 (login with user/password).\r\n\r\nSo far this UI has only been dev tested and there will likely be some bugs found.  If reviewers feel they have found a critical bug that should be fixed before this can be accepted, please state that and we will address it ASAP.  Otherwise I will create Jiras for bugs/issues that can be done as follow on work.\r\n\r\nThis is a very large pull request that contains mostly client-side code.  The application was built on the [Angular 2](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/) framework using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).\r\n\r\nChanges that are outside of metron-interface/metron-config (Management UI module) include:\r\n\r\n- Addition of \"/api/v1/grok/get/statement\" REST endpoint that gets a grok statement from the classpath instead of HDFS\r\n- A couple fields added to the Storm topology status response (emitted and acked tuples)\r\n- Updated REST documentation\r\n- Apache Rat exclusions added to the top level pom.xml\r\n\r\nThere are a couple tasks still outstanding so don't merge until those are complete.  These tasks should not affect functional testing or code review.  They include:\r\n\r\n- add angular unit tests to the Maven build cycle (tests pass and can be run with `npm test` in the metron-config directory, they just don't get executed on a top level build yet)\r\n- optimize build process and dependencies (our build process is already painful, need to ensure this doesn't make it worse)\r\n- add architectural documentation to the README\r\n- resolve error when building the site-book\r\n\r\nI will keep the thread updated as these are completed.  Thanks for reviewing!\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron (Incubating).  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?
