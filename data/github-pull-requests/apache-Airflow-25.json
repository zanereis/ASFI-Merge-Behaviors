case only pyproject.toml changes we should automatically build CI image as we need to run full set of static checks - including mypy and other tools.\r\n\r\nThis change triggers ci-image for such case and it also fixes a subtle bug where \"pyproject_toml_changed\" was always set to true (but nothing depended on it, because we are checking if build dependencies changed in pyproject.toml to trigger full build as most of the build logic and dependencies is in hatch_build.py\r\n\r\nThe change first now attempts to see if the pyprject.toml changed at all (i.e. if pyprooject.toml is in the list of files that are changed in the commit) and only then reads the content of old and new version of pyproject.toml to compare them. This will make selective checks a bit faster as it won't run two git commands when pyproject.toml has not changed.\r\n\r\nAlso tests_common are now added to \"all sources\" group which should trigger tests when only tests_common change.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

\"definition code\" we mean anything needed at definition/parse time, leaving\r\nanything to do with scheduling time decisions in Airflow's core.\r\n\r\nAlso in this PR I have _attempted_ to keep it to only porting defintiion code\r\nfor simple DAGs, leaving anything to do with mapped tasks or execution time in\r\ncore for now, but a few things \"leaked\" across.\r\n\r\nAnd as the goal of this PR is to go from working state to working state some\r\nof the code in Task SDK still imports from \"core\" (various types, enums or\r\nhelpers) that will need to be resolved before 3.0 release, but it is fine for\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nI'm also aware that the class hierarchy with\r\nairflow.models.baseoperator.BaseOperator (and to a lesser extend with DAG) in\r\nparticular is very messy right now, and we will need to think how we want to\r\nadd on the scheduling-time functions etc, as I'm not yet sold that having Core\r\nAirflow depend upon the Task-SDK classes/import the code is the right\r\nstructure, but we can address that later\r\n\r\nWe will also need to addresses the rendered docs for the Task SDK in a future\r\nPR -- the goal is that \"anything\" exposed on `airflow.sdk`

If the state is still different then fall back to the old logic of assuming that the task state has changed externally.\r\n\r\nI am not sure if I've picked the right base for this PR. The backfill stuff is being totally re-written for Airflow 3 as part of [AIP-78](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/AIP-78+Scheduler-managed+backfill) so I wouldn't know where to make this change or even if the same bug exists there.\r\n\r\n# Update 2024-10-17\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/discussions/42991#discussioncomment-10965832 I patched the change into my deployment and am seeing the added log line being emitted, and _not_ followed by the `The executor reported that the task instance finished with state success, but the task instance's state attribute is queued` message. This tells me that the refresh is probably necessary under such circumstances.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

Summary\r\n\r\nAdds a new sensor to the Google Cloud provider that waits on the status of a target in a workflow invocation.\r\n\r\n# Why might this be useful?\r\n\r\nRight now I use Airflow to trigger a Dataform workflow on a schedule. I use the `async=True` argument on the `DataformCreateWorkflowInvocationOperator` and the `DataformWorkflowInvocationStateSensor` to wait until the workflow is complete before running subsequent steps. This approach is simple but comes with some tradeoffs due to its lack of granularity.\r\n\r\n1. If any target in the workflow fails, the sensor will also fail. If I want to have subsequent tasks run for any target that does succeed, this approach will not work.\r\n2. If I have multiple targets that my subsequent tasks depend on, there may be large gap between when Dataform completes the tasks. This approach has subsequent tasks run when the whole Dataform workflow is complete.\r\n\r\nThe sensor added in this PR addresses the trade offs listed above by providing a more granular sensor. Instead of waiting for the workflow to complete, it waits for a target within the workflow to complete.","created_at":"2024-10-15T20:53:30Z","updated_at":"2024-11-06T15:20:08Z","closed_at":"2024-10-23T13:50:50Z","merged_at":"2024-10-23T13:50:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"ca2c809b30607af7ee320510587fe93b1ab90218","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1463392518,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDYzMzkyNTE4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:google","name":"provider:google","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"Google

The `get_name` method has been implemented in both the StatsD and OTel metrics logger classes to handle metric name construction consistently across backends.\r\n\r\n**Note:** The PR is not fully finished and it does not close #42881. I'm sending it to PR to see if I can proceed and finish it.  The `get_name` method has been integrated into the `incr` method of the StatsD logger, but I have not applied it to other methods yet. I'm doing this to verify whether it aligns with the proposed functionality before further updates.\r\n\r\n**Changes:**\r\n- Added the `get_name` abstract method to the base metrics logger interface.\r\n- Implemented the `get_name` method in the StatsD logger class to concatenate tags with the metric name.\r\n- Implemented the `get_name` method in the OTel logger class to return the metric name directly.\r\n- Updated the `incr` method in the StatsD class to utilize the `get_name` method for constructing metric names.\r\n\r\nPlease review the changes and provide feedback!\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

Overview\r\nDropping support for git-sync v3, only supporting v4.1+.\r\n\r\n### Summary of Changes\r\nFollowing the changes described in https://github.com/kubernetes/git-sync/blob/v4.1.0/v3-to-v4.md, made the following changes:\r\n\r\n- Removed chart params `dags.gitSync.branch` and `dags.gitSync.rev`, they are deprecated, [source](https://github.com/kubernetes/git-sync/blob/v4.1.0/v3-to-v4.md#sync-target---branch-and---rev-----ref)\r\n- Removed chart params `dags.gitSync.wait`, also deprecated, [source](https://github.com/kubernetes/git-sync/blob/v4.1.0/v3-to-v4.md#loop---wait-----period)\r\n- Changed all env vars to only start with `GITSYNC_`, not `GIT_SYNC_`, [source](https://github.com/kubernetes/git-sync/blob/v4.1.0/v3-to-v4.md#env-vars)\r\n- Removed env var for `GITSYNC_SSH`, [source](https://github.com/kubernetes/git-sync/blob/v4.1.0/v3-to-v4.md#ssh---ssh-is-optional-after-v400)\r\n  - This makes the minimum version supported be 4.1, not 4.0\r\n- Removed comments about v3 or v4\r\n\r\n### Related Issues\r\ncloses: #42918\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

after #42505 fixing teething problem with tests_common.\r\n\r\nOriginally in #42505 common test code was moved to \"dev\" folder, but the \"dev\" folder is really dedicated to \"build\" scripts and the problem with moving \"tests_common\" to the folder was that the whole \"dev\" folder is replaced (for non-committer PRs) with the content from the target branch.\r\n\r\nThis is done for security reasons, because we can accidentally use any of the scripts from dev in the CI build scripts and we might not notice, which will open us to a security issue where a file in \"dev\" coming from PR could be accidentally executed during the \"pull_request_target\" workflow - which would expose our secrets and GitHub Package write permissions to a contributor coming from a fork.\r\n\r\nThis change moves the files, fixes pre-commit specification and docs, also fixes a number of \"doc\" issues detected by \"ruff\" in the tests_common folder as they were detected after the move. The tests_common folder is added to folders mounted when breeze is executed with local folders mounted (in order to avoid accidental mounting of randomly generated files to inside the breeze container).\r\n\r\nAll imports for the common tests were updated to reflect this move.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

was a problem with CI image builds when cache has been disabled - they still used \"pre-cached\" main version (unlike PROD builds). This PR synchronizes the behaviour between CI and PROD builds.\r\n\r\nFor removing dependencies, you need to set both:\r\n\r\n* `disable docker cache` label\r\n* incerase DEPENDENCIES_EPOCH_NUMBER in `Dockerfile.ci`\r\n\r\nComments and documentation in both places has been updated to reflect it.\r\n\r\nSince documentation for labels has been updated,\r\nPart of this PR is to improve the description of possible labels that could be used during the build.\r\nThe description grew from a small number of labels to a \"wall of text\" that was difficult to read. This PR reformats it in the form of table that makes it far easier to see actions that the maintainer can do and what labels should be set for each of them.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

Issue:** #42823 \r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new **User Settings Menu** that allows users to toggle between light and dark themes, replacing the previous button in the navbar. \r\n\r\n**Overview of Changes:**\r\n\r\n- Following the suggestion by @bbovenzi in [this comment](https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/42823#issuecomment-2406840483), I have implemented a **UserSettingsButton.tsx** component. This new component is basically a menu with a user icon that has an item to change the theme.\r\n- The menu is easily accessible within the navbar.\r\n\r\n**Implementation Details:**\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n<Menu placement=\"right\">\r\n  <MenuButton\r\n    as={IconButton}\r\n    icon={<FiUser size=\"1.75rem\" />}\r\n    {...navButtonProps}\r\n  />\r\n  <MenuList>\r\n    <MenuItem onClick={toggleColorMode}>\r\n      {colorMode === \"light\" ? (\r\n        <>\r\n          <FiMoon size=\"1.25rem\" style={{ marginRight: \"8px\" }} />\r\n          Switch to Dark Mode\r\n        </>\r\n      ) : (\r\n        <>\r\n          <FiSun size=\"1.25rem\" style={{ marginRight: \"8px\" }} />\r\n          Switch to Light Mode\r\n        </>\r\n      )}\r\n    </MenuItem>\r\n  </MenuList>\r\n</Menu>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Before and After:**\r\n\r\n- **Before:** \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23d88be7-a57c-404b-847c-601160800228\r\n  \r\n- **After:**\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8614341-da5d-4d64-bbae-eacd7d5e716d\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.
