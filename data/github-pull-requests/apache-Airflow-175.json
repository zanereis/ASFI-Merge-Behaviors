#9415\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to replace the use of `PythonOperator` and `PythonVirtualEnvOperator` tasks for the TaskFlow API in several core example DAGs.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, there are instances of replacing `trigger_rule` values with the appropriate `TriggerRule` attr instead of the literal string, removing an unnecessary `dag` arg in _example_skip_dag_, and replacing `PythonOperator` in _example_complex_ for `BashOperator` (since it was the only task that wasn't a `BashOperator` and using a `PythonOperator` task really wasn't adding any value to the example).\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add

If so, I can clean up these failures.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing! Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests.

MSSQL tests sometimes failed with \"unhealthy\" status. The reaso for\r\nthat was that our cleanup did not properly clean hidden files I think.\r\nWe were potentially reusing the bind volumes for MSSQL tests, but it\r\nturned out that we did not remove hidden files from that volume and that\r\nlikely caused problems accross 2017/2019 versions when the volumes were\r\nreused.\r\n\r\nThis change implements two-fold protection against such case:\r\n* the volumes have different path for different MSSQL versions\r\n* hidden files are also removed\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

we are referring ``{{task}}`` in jinja templates we can also\r\nrefer some of the fields, which are templated. We are not\r\nable to solve all the problems with such rendering (specifically\r\nrecursive rendering of the fields used in JINJA templating might\r\nbe problematic. Currently whether you see original, or rendered\r\nfield depends solely on the sequence in templated_fields.\r\n\r\nHowever that would not even explain the rendering problem\r\ndescribed in #13559 where kwargs were defined after opargs and\r\nthe rendering of opargs **should** work. It turned out that\r\nthe problem was with a change introduced in #8805 which made\r\nthe context effectively holds a DIFFERENT task than the current\r\none. Context held an original task, and the curren task was\r\nactually a locked copy of it (to allow resolving upstream\r\nargs before locking). As a result, any changes done by\r\nrendering templates were not visible in the task accessed\r\nvia {{ task }} jinja variable.\r\n\r\nThis change replaces the the task stored in context with the\r\nsame copy that is then used later during execution so that\r\nat least the \"sequential\" rendering works and templated\r\nfields which are 'earlier' in the list of templated fields\r\ncan be used (and render correctly) in the following fields.\r\n\r\nFixes: #13559\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

written in section https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/concepts/scheduler.html#database-requirements, MariaDB higher than 10.6 should work well in HA mode, but has not been tested, so I have tested it and it doesn't work because\r\n1) MariaDB 10.6 doesn't support  update OF, but support NOWAIT and SKIP LOCKED well, so in current version of AIRFLOW if condition is wrong -- fixed in this PR\r\n2) SQLAlchemy==1.3.24 knew nothing about MariaDB 10.6 and contains this fragment of code https://github.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/blob/rel_1_3_24/lib/sqlalchemy/dialects/mysql/base.py#L1609 as a result, we get query  without SKIP LOCKED. It works correct in 1.4.0 and higher but we can't update this dependency because of https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/14811 (webserver crash). In our infrastructure I tested latest version of SQLAlchemy and Scheduler work well, but webserver not. \r\n\r\nAs far as we merged thin PR and update SQLAlchemy Airflow will support HA Schedulers with MariaDB 10.6+\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

know that this TI belongs to this relationship, so setting this\navoids a lookup in a few places.\n\nThis somehow feels like we are fighting SQLAlchemy a bit, but from what\nI can work out the only way to do this would either be an eager load of\none form or another (which would make a more complex query or an extra\nquery) or to look at `self.task_instances` -- which means the filtering\nwould be done in python space -- which we want to avoid for large dags\n(it's not totally unheard of to have dags with 10 or 20k tasks in them!)\n\n\nRelates to #18359 (but is in addition to that

https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/18485\r\n\r\nThe removal of the `v1beta2` client from the `google-cloud-dataproc` library in release 2.6.0 makes dataproc operators unusable. \r\n\r\nWe can get around this temporarily by pinning the installation of the library to the previous version. \r\n\r\nIn a follow-up PR I can update all of the dataproc integrations to use the stable `dataproc_v1` client. \r\n\r\nI suppose that this will require a new release of the `apache-airflow-providers-google` library in order to fix potentially broken installations?\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful

There are some copy-paste between the two tests but I think there is no need for further abstraction or code-reuse because YAGNI.\r\n-  Also refactored the existing ServiceAccount annotations test to make it IMO simpler and more readable.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

for this PR is [OpenLineage's](https://openlineage.io/) [Airflow integration.](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/tree/main/integration/airflow)\r\n\r\nCurrently, LineageBackend is notified only when task succesfully completes.\r\nThis PR implements support for two additional methods for `LineageBackend` - to become notified when task starts and when it fails. Those methods are optional, and any implementations of `LineageBackend` should work exactly the same if they won't implement it.\r\n\r\nWith addition to adding those methods, they are hooked with (AFAIK) appropriate places to do so. \r\nAlso, changed loading lineage backend to be lazy.  \r\n\r\nNow, I think few things are incomplete. \r\nI have no idea what behavior should be for lineage inlets and outlets in context of a failed job - so I just ignored them.\r\n\r\nImplements https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/17984\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Maciej Obuchowski

the `TaskInstanceModelView` and `DagRunModelView` it has recently become possible that you won't see all DAGs as you don't have edit permission for them.\r\n\r\nFlask-Appbuilder doesn't natively support this behaviour as it does not verify for your actions whether you are only passing in primary keys of rows you are allowed to edit, by default you can still provide primary-keys of DagRuns and TaskInstance you don't have access to and you will be able to modify them.\r\nTo prevent this from happening, we created the `@action_has_dag_edit_access` decorator.\r\n\r\nIn the `TaskInstanceModelView` and `DagRunModelView` classes we need to enforce that the `@action_has_dag_edit_access` is used. Therefore, I created a test to verify this one is being used on every `action` function of these classes.\r\n\r\nThis came to light due to

might lead to slightly longer exit time when exiting\r\nfrom Breeze, but since we are running it only when the host is\r\nLinux and the fixung is rather performant - with explicitly finding\r\nfiles

of our migration (adding max_tries) creates the DagBag and\r\neffectively parses all the DAGS while performing the migraiions.\r\n\r\nWhile this is needed in case you migrate from an older version of\r\nthe DB where you have some TaskInstances requiring migration, for\r\nan empty database, there are no TaskInstance entities in the DB\r\nand parsing of all the DAGs is not needed.\r\n\r\nActually it can even be harmful. If you attempt to run Airflow\r\nMigration on an empty dataase and your DAGs will be erroneous,\r\nyour migration will break in the middle and you have no\r\nclue what caused it = see #18408 for an example of such failure.\r\n\r\nThis PR skips DagBag import when there are no TaskInstance in\r\nthe database to migrate.\r\n\r\nFixes: #18449\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

Integration with `sqlalchemy` is supported via `sqlalchemy-redshift`. \r\n\r\nUnit tests have been added to:\r\n- Test Hook -- ensuring connection parameters flow through to `redshift_connector` as expected\r\n- Test Operator -- ensuring statements flow through to `redshift_connector.execute` method as expected\r\n\r\nDocs have been added to:\r\n- explain how to build a connection\r\n- provide an example DAG with create/insert/select statements\r\n- provide reference to `redshift_connector` docs for details about supported connection options\r\n\r\n\r\n### Use case / motivation\r\n\r\nThere is now a redshift_connector library which we can use instead of psycopg2.  The redshift connector library provides support for IAM & Identity provider authentication as well as Redshift specific datatype support (e.g. GEOMETRY, SUPER, etc.).\r\n\r\nSee #16355 for more

PR is based on: #17592 and closes: #13750\r\nSqlSensor relies on underlying hooks that are automatically injected (DI) depending on the connection type provided to the SqlSensor. However, from time to time (but mainly in BigqueryHook) it is needed to pre-configure the \"to-be-injected\" hook because some default params do not fit the current config.\r\nFor example, if using SqlSensor with Bigquery it by default configures the SQL dialect to \"legacy SQL\", and there is no way to change this through configuration.

However, from time to time (but mainly in BigqueryHook) it is needed to pre-configure the \"to-be-injected\" hook because some default params do not fit the current config.\r\n\r\nFor example, if using SqlSensor with Bigquery it by default configures the SQL dialect to \"legacy SQL\", and there is no way to change this through configuration. Instead, the SqlSensor has to be extended and some functions are overwritten.","created_at":"2021-09-20T22:48:20Z","updated_at":"2021-12-05T22:26:39Z","closed_at":"2021-09-22T00:24:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4299764e961facb031c6608e2a33a03dc0a1b5b2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"bbovenzi","id":4600967,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MDA5Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4600967?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi","html_url":"https://github.com/bbovenzi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"dimberman","id":2644098,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NDQwOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2644098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman","html_url":"https://github.com/dimberman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimberman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ephraimbuddy","id":4122866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjI4NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4122866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.git
