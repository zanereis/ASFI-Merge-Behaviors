secrets masker added in 2.1.0 introduced requirement that\r\nat least one SecretsMasker needs to be configured per task.\r\n\r\nHowever this introduced problems for several users who migrated\r\nfrom Airflow 1.10 and had their custom logging configuration\r\ndone without first copying the base airflow configuration.\r\n\r\nThe message about missing SecretsMasker was pretty cryptic for the\r\nusers. This PR changes the message to be much more descriptive\r\nand pointing the user to the right place in documentation\r\nexplaining how advanced logging configuration should be done.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

takes a params dictionary at the DAG level or at a Task level that can be overridden by providing dag_run.conf values. However, this params dictionary is quite static in nature and doesn't provide much value addition. \r\n\r\nThere have been quite some requests made by the community on this already, like https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/11054, https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/16430, https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/17085\r\n\r\n## Goal\r\n\r\n- Keep the backward compatibility, i.e. the simple params should work as they are right now\r\n- The params should have the notion of a default value, different types (int, bool, str etc), and various options to validate the user input.\r\n- The UI should show proper input controls according to the type of param, showing which are must and which are optional, pre-filled with their default values if any.\r\n- It would be good if UI can show the options list or do live pattern matches if a param utilizes them.\r\n- Airflow honors these params even if someone triggers a DAG via CLI or API.\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\n\r\n- We create a new class or set of classes say `Param` which can be used in place of the value part of params dictionary.\r\n- This class should hold the default value and validation rules as well.\r\n- There should be a method that validates & resolves the value of this Param class. The value could be the default one or provided by the user.\r\n- We should be able to easily serialize or deserialize it out of DB and use it in place of a normal params value place.\r\n- Should work with the standard way of DAG creation as well as with the new DAG decorator.\r\n\r\n## Approaches\r\n\r\n### [pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/)\r\n\r\nPydantic is one of the fastest Python libraries to provide data & type validations ([benchmark](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/benchmarks/)). I'd implemented various params classes in it (see [sample](https://gist.github.com/msumit/1a596f3a98f411dae891a42cd13e2812)) but did not like the way I had to write validators for each field separately. Also, the order you define fields matters a lot how one can access them in those validator methods. \r\n\r\n### [attrs](https://pypi.org/project/attrs/)\r\n\r\nHave used attrs previously and it's also in use within Airflow already. attrs simplifies writing classes and also exposes various in-build validators & pre-post init methods. Using attrs it was quite easy to create these classes (see [this](https://github.com/astronomer/airflow/blob/dag_params/airflow/models/params.py)), though we've to fill in the logic by ourselves to do the data validation. We also felt that more & more such data validation requirements would come from the users and it could turn into a big pile of code in itself. \r\n\r\n### [json-schema](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/)\r\n\r\nWe are using json-schema for DAG serialization already. json-schema has a very powerful & extensive way to define properties (validations) on a field in a language-agnostic way. It has implementation libs in almost all major [languages](https://json-schema.org/implementations.html). The custom code using json-schema is pretty minimum ([here](https://github.com/astronomer/airflow/blob/simple_params/airflow/models/param.py)) & provides very extensive validations. \r\n\r\nWe should be able to use its Javascript implementation and validate data on the UI itself. The only concern here is that the json-schema rules can become pretty complex easily & users might found it hard to read and understand.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Trigger DAG page\r\n<img width=\"1056\" alt=\"Screenshot 2021-07-15 at 2 06 36 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2018407/126268835-f833c15a-cf9e-4d67-a242-d734fff43af9.png\">\r\n<img width=\"1159\" alt=\"Screenshot 2021-07-15 at 2 08 36 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2018407/126268847-4ea5d70c-70a7-49f6-8a40-36ea03f54dbd.png\">\r\n\r\n### DAG details API\r\n<img width=\"354\" alt=\"Screenshot 2021-07-15 at 2 10 18 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2018407/126268850-4c853358-f146-4aa5-b6cc-187aac6180d8.png\">\r\n\r\n### DAG Trigger API\r\n<img width=\"1413\" alt=\"Screenshot 2021-07-15 at 2 11 15 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2018407/126268853-5706f1dd-bf87-4d33-a641-9f93d054c635.png\">\r\n\r\n### DAG trigger via CLI\r\n```\r\n$airflow dags trigger example_complex_params --conf '{\"str_param\": \"hello\"}'\r\n\r\nValueError: Invalid input for param 'str_param': 'hello' is too long\r\n\r\nFailed validating 'maxLength' in schema:\r\n    {'maxLength': 4, 'minLength': 2, 'type': 'string'}\r\n\r\nOn instance:\r\n    'hello'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Tasks test via CLI\r\n```\r\n$airflow tasks test example_complex_params all_param 2021-07-15T08:43:45 -t '{\"task_param\": true}'\r\n\r\nValueError: True is not of type 'string'\r\n\r\nFailed validating 'type' in schema:\r\n    {'type': 'string'}\r\n\r\nOn instance:\r\n    True    \r\n```\r\n\r\nThanks a lot to @ashb & @kaxil for their inputs.

#16577 change removed yarn.lock from installed packages\r\nand it removed the possibility of preparing assets after the\r\npackage is installed - so far that was the way it was done in\r\nthe PROD

The asset compilation\r\nwas supposed to work after the change but it was not\r\nperformed in this case.\r\n\r\nThe change fixes it by:\r\n\r\n* detecting properly if the PROD image is built from sources\r\n  (INSTALLATION_METHOD)\r\n* compiling the assets from sources, not from package\r\n* installing airflow from sources AFTER assets were compiled\r\n\r\nFixes #16939\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

we used to determine the URL based on two environment variables: `AIRFLOW__CELERY__BROKER_URL`, `AIRFLOW__CELERY__BROKER_URL_CMD`, but it is not enough.  Airflow also allows us to set URL using `AIRFLOW__CELERY__BROKER_URL_SECRET` environment variable or `airflow.cfg` file  Sometimes the default value may also be sufficient for some users - `redis://redis:6379/0`\r\nNow, we run the check only when Celery is used and we use the built-in airflow commands to determine the connection URL, which means that the value determined by `entrypoint_prod.sh` and airflow match.\r\n\r\nFor details, see: https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/howto/set-config.html\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

What files have been modified?\r\n1. CONTRIBUTING.RST\r\n2. CONTRIBUTORS_QUICK_START.rst\r\n\r\n### What changes will be made as part of this PR or how does this PR help?\r\nThis pull request updates the above mentioned two documentation files by adding the installation information for the `jq` library and marks it as a prerequisite for installing `breeze`. After moving to the ghrc.io images, users are facing issue in setting up breeze and the error that comes up while setting up breeze is as follows:\r\n```\r\nairflow/scripts/ci/libraries/_build_images.sh: line 427: jq: command not found\r\n``` \r\nPlease refer to the below screenshot for the same error message.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6072170/126025000-7694fcfd-36b6-4dab-8e2f-a6a2cba3dd3a.png)\r\n\r\nInstalling `jq` library on the local machine fixes this issue. This can be done using `sudo apt install jq`. Below screenshot is a proof that the command works on Ubuntu 20.04 machine and installs `jq`.\r\n\r\n![IMG_2363](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6072170/126025045-c4dd7697-347e-4cf8-91ab-183b74a9ada4.jpeg)\r\n\r\nI have run the pre-commits for these changes using `pre-commit

case we have additional dependencies between providers released\r\nat the same time (for example we need to release sftp and ssh\r\npackages now where sftp package depends on release of ssh\r\nat the same time) we have to add suffix to the version of the\r\nadditional_dependency.\r\n\r\nPIP does not take into account unfortunately that development\r\ndependencies should likely be considered as fulfilling the\r\nrequirement of >=. For example if you have:\r\n\r\nsftp depends on ssh>=2.1.0 and you release ssh 2.1.0.dev0 at\r\nthe same time the ssh>=2.1.0 condition is not fulfilled.\r\n\r\nSame case will be with rc1. Therefore we need to add the suffix in such\r\ncross-provider dependencies to be able to install them in CI\r\nand in rc candidates.\r\n\r\nIn the future we might ask PIP to change behaviour in such case.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

1.10 series reached end of life, so the Dockerfile on main can drop support it.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this solves one problem that the user reported. We used CLI check for Airflow 1.10 to check the database connection, and for Airflow 2.0 legacy check, which only supports some database engines.  However, we should do it the other way around. For Airflow 2.0, we should use a CLI check. \r\n\r\nIf we use CLI Check, we have MSSQL and any other backend support automatically.\r\n\r\nFor details, see: https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/16857\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

`retry_delay` is zero, the `retry_exponential_backoff` algorithm has a divide-by-zero error in the `modded_hash` calculation, which causes the scheduler to crash.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/commit/d1dceff69ab15f9ce28ea04215a693b81c8a93a2 attempted to address the divide-by-zero error by adding a ceiling function, but it doesn't account for this particular edge case. Using a lower bound instead would be a better implementation.\r\n\r\nFixes #17005.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing! Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests.

#16950 aimed to fix an incompatibility introduced by\r\nbeta version of docker-compose v2 (which is automatically pushed\r\nto MacOS users now).\r\n\r\nThe issue is documented in\r\nhttps://github.com/docker/compose-cli/issues/1917\r\n\r\nUnfortunately it has an undesired side-effect that the same file\r\ncannot be used to specify list of variables for docker command\r\n(the variables come empty).\r\n\r\nUntil the problem is solved, we need to keep two copies of those\r\nvariable files. Not ideal, but hopefully the issue will be solved\r\nsoon and we can go back to original env file in docker-compose v2.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

reference to #16790, I have worked on this \"Task Note\" feature. \r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, a task note is a user-provided annotation for a task instance that keeps track of Airflow-external events that are not collected in the logs. \r\n\r\n**Model**\r\nThe model consists of (dag_id, task_id, execution_date, timestamp) that form the primary key a user_name, and a task_note field. The task not field is an unbounded collection of text. \r\n\r\n**Table**\r\nI have created a new table \"Task notes\" to store notes. \r\n\r\n**Views**\r\nThere are two new views. The task instance details view has a new \"sub view\" that contains the task note and there is a new menu called \"task notes\". \r\n\r\n**Task Note view**:\r\nUsers can view in a tabular fashion the notes related to that task and, if authorized, can submit a new task note. \r\n\r\n**Task notes menu**:\r\nUsers can list all the task notes, edit them and delete them (Similar to xcom menu)\r\n\r\n**Security**\r\nI have introduced a new resource \"Task note\", viewers can list all the task notes, while users can edit/create/delete them. \r\n(In the current implementation, users can edit other users' notes)\r\n\r\n**Screenshot**\r\n[Viewers without creating task note permissions](https://ibb.co/h2B6xps)\r\n[Users with creating task note permission](https://ibb.co/CWdMBkb)\r\n[Task note menu](https://ibb.co/VCVcrSp)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Question**\r\n\r\n1.  It's not entirely clear to me how ` airflow/migrations/versions` works, I have just added the table creation there, but it's likely wrong. \r\n2. Should task notes' sizes be limited?\r\n3. Once this flow has been reviewed and validated, I will be happy to write a piece of documentation maybe `docs/apache-airflow/concepts/task-note.rst` ?\r\n4. API endpoints are missing from this, do you think they should be added?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-12T21:10:31Z","updated_at":"2021-08-01T21:40:26Z","closed_at":"2021-08-01T17:51:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"dcd34ffbe415ad507f16b8e4263355381031d6bd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"jhtimmins","id":4926004,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MjYwMDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4926004?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhtimmins","html_url":"https://github.com/jhtimmins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhtimmins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhtimmins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhtimmins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhtimmins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhtimmins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhtimmins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhtimmins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhtimmins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhtimmins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ryanahamilton","id":3267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanahamilton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"turbaszek","id":9528307,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjgzMDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9528307?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek","html_url":"https://github.com/turbaszek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":15

refactor of `KubernetesPodOperator` enabling easy switch of pod launcher used inside this class.\r\n\r\n**Motivation**\r\nIn our project we use custom pod launcher which inherits from standard `pod_launcher.PodLauncher`. With current structure of the code it's not easy to use custom pod launcher as `execute` method needs to be rewritten.\r\n\r\nTo give you better understanding of why we need custom pod launcher below you can find our abstract custom pod launcher class, with which we can conduct actions specific to our use-cases/environment tied to lifecycle of pod created by KubernetesPodOperator.\r\n```\r\nclass PodLauncherWithHooks(PodLauncher):\r\n    def run_pod_async(self, pod, **kwargs):\r\n        self.before_create_hook(pod)\r\n\r\n        result = super(PodLauncherWithHooks, self).run_pod_async(pod,

all,\r\nI propose you a new Airflow Operator for Tableau: `TableauRefreshDatasourceOperator`. This new operator uses the Tableau API to refresh an existing Datasource published in a Tableau Server. \r\n\r\nThe operator is very similar to `TableauRefreshWorkbookOperator`, but I thought it was more clear and clean to create a new one instead to modify the existing one.\r\n\r\nThe operator is very useful to refresh data sources, not in time set way but in an asynchronous way, in my case, it is very useful to add the refresh after my ETL pipelines. I'm currently using this operator in my Airflow installation.\r\n\r\n### Changes:\r\n\r\n1. Created TableauRefreshDatasourceOperator\r\n2. Created unit test for TableauRefreshDatasourceOperator\r\n3. Added the operator to the provider.yaml file\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you.","created_at":"2021-07-12T09:29:58Z","updated_at":"2021-08-13T13:41:14Z","closed_at":"2021-08-13T13:41:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d1b63255105905e5d50d1012ea0663b8b5b24595","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1697155831,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjk3MTU1ODMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:providers","name":"area:providers","color":"d4c5f9","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2458345138,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNDU4MzQ1MTM4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/okay%20to%20merge","name":"okay
