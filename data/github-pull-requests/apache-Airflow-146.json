were a few issues in https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/23487 and how we dealt with open/closing groups.\r\n\r\nThe open/closed group logic was being handled in two separate places and could have different sources of truth. This logic was moved to a parent component and using a more conventional `useState` as opposed to dispatching a custom event.\r\n\r\nIncluded a bit of code reorganization to set `<Main />` as the main wrapper for the grid and details panel. `<Grid />` then only refers to the actual grid place and its associated controls (expand/collapse groups, and auto-refresh). AutoRefresh also gets its own component.\r\n\r\nAlso, while refactoring, I removed is depending on `task.id.split('.')` to determine if all parent tasks were also open as task_id can include periods. Now it just matches the open parent count to the level count.\r\n\r\nFixes: https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/23580\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1152\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-05-09 at 10 55 23 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4600967/167437479-f2a83825-9033-4aee-b1df-9e33e8ece402.png\">\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.rst#pull-request-guidelines)** for more information.\r\nIn case of fundamental code change, Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)) is needed.\r\nIn case of a new dependency, check compliance with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\nIn case of backwards incompatible changes please leave a note in a newsfragement file, named `{pr_number}.significant.rst`, in [newsfragments](https://github.com/apache/airflow/tree/main/newsfragments).\r\n","created_at":"2022-05-09T14:55:34Z","updated_at":"2022-05-17T06:08:20Z","closed_at":"2022-05-12T19:48:31Z","merged_at":"2022-05-12T19:48:31Z","merge_commit_sha":"afdfece9372fed83602d50e2eaa365597b7d0101","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ryanahamilton","id":3267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanahamilton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545584474,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTg0NDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:webserver","name":"area:webserver","color":"a9db3f","default":false,"description":"Webserver related Issues"},{"id":2172803017,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcyODAzMDE3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:bug-fix","name":"type:bug-fix","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog: Bug Fixes"},{"id":2458345138,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNDU4MzQ1MTM4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/okay%20to%20merge","name":"okay to merge","color":"64e05c","default":false,"description":"It's ok to merge this PR as it does not require more tests"},{"id":2514952451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTE0OTUyNDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:UI","name":"area:UI","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"Related to UI/UX.

we generated output of all the commands from Breeze always,\r\nhoping that they will be the same, but rich already had two changes\r\nin the format of the SVG files which made the output different and\r\nbreaking our PRs.\r\n\r\nTemporarily we pinned rich to fix the output, but better solution is\r\nto get the hash of all the configuration options and see if it changed,\r\nand only run generation when it did. This way we keep automated\r\ngeneration on pre-commit but we are protected from accidental change\r\nof the output.\r\n\r\nWe also remove the rich limitations.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

is another attempt to improve caching performance for\r\nmulti-platform images as the previous ones were undermined by a\r\nbug in buildx multiplatform cache-to implementattion that caused\r\nthe image cache to be overwritten between platforms,\r\nwhen multiple images were build.\r\n\r\nThe bug is created for the buildx behaviour at\r\nhttps://github.com/docker/buildx/issues/1044 and until it is fixed\r\nwe have to prpare separate caches for each platform and push them\r\nto separate tags.\r\n\r\nThat adds a bit overhead on the building step, but for now it is\r\nthe simplest way we can workaround the bug if we do not want to\r\nmanually manipulate manifests and images.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

Motivation\r\nIn certain databases there is a need to set the collation for ID fields like `dag_id` or `task_id` to something different than the database default. This is because in MySQL with utf8mb4 the index size becomes too big for the MySQL limits. In past pull requests this was handled [#7570](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/7570), [#17729](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/17729), but the `root_dag_id` field on the dag model was missed. Since this field is used to join with the `dag_id` in various other models ([and self-referentially](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/451c7cbc42a83a180c4362693508ed33dd1d1dab/airflow/models/dag.py#L2766)), it also needs to have the same collation as other ID fields.\r\n\r\nThis can be seen by running `airflow db reset` before and after applying this change while also specifying `sql_engine_collation_for_ids` in the configuration.\r\n\r\nWithout this change affected database setups could see issues like the following:\r\n```py\r\nsqlalchemy.exc.OperationalError: (MySQLdb._exceptions.OperationalError) (1267, \"Illegal mix of collations (utf8_unicode_ci,IMPLICIT) and (utf8_general_ci,IMPLICIT) for operation '='\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich could also be resolved manually by running something similar to the generated SQL. For example, in MySQL 5.7:\r\n```sql\r\nALTER TABLE dag MODIFY root_dag_id VARCHAR(250) COLLATE utf8mb3_general_ci DEFAULT NULL;\r\n```\r\n\r\nOther related pull requests: [#19408](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/19408)\r\n\r\n#### Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\nSince the downgrade is just to drop the column, there shouldn't be any problems.\r\n\r\n#### Tests?\r\nSince there weren't many tests covering these cases when the changes were made in the previously referenced pull requests, it didn't seem needed in this specific case. Let me know if that's not the case though we can talk about what those might look like.","created_at":"2022-05-06T16:34:49Z","updated_at":"2022-05-17T06:19:27Z","closed_at":"2022-05-09T17:48:12Z","merged_at":"2022-05-09T17:48:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"b7f862760ce4e20a284bb1933c9078e54851c518","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2172803017,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcyODAzMDE3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:bug-fix","name":"type:bug-fix","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog:

in airflow 2.3.0 the scheduler will get into an infinite loop if the k8s API ever response with a 410 (too old resource version / resource version too old). \r\n\r\nThis currently happen in airflow deployments in separate EKS 1.21 clusters, where every hour or so the scheduler will be stuck printing the error below in a tight loop, and will require manual restart.\r\n\r\nBelow is a log except from a scheduler in such state (tight loop of `too old resource version` error).

Clusters using etcd 3 preserve changes in the last 5 minutes by default. When the requested watch operations fail because the historical version of that resource is not available, clients must handle the case by recognizing the status code 410 Gone, clearing their local cache, **performing a new get or list operation, and starting the watch from the resourceVersion that was returned.** [ecerulm: using the resourceVersion that was returned in the get/list operation, not the one that KubernetesJobWatcher saved]\r\n* This new attempt to watch from resourceVersion 380528372 will fail with a 410 resource too old (in my scenario this happens with high probability after the scheduler has been up for 1 hour) . Again this is expected non-exceptional case, there is no guarantee that you can restart the watch for resource version 380528372. \r\n* When the watch operation fails immediately with `kubernetes.client.exceptions.ApiException: (410) \r\n Reason: Expired: too old resource version: 380528372 (382477719)` KubernetesJobWatcher  will die \r\n* Then a new KubernetesJobWatcher will start that tries again to start the watch from exactly the same resource version 380528372 and that will again fail for the same reason  \r\n* From this point on the scheduler will be stuck with no progress, will continue in a tight infinite loop of starting KubernetesJobWatcher, letting it do a watch that will always fails, noticing that KubernetesJobWatcher died again, starting it again, etc \r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR solves the situation (already tested for 10 hours in one of my airflow deployments in EKS) by always starting a fresh watch (resourceVersion=0) after KubernetesJobWatcher dies.  \r\n\r\n\r\ncloses: #21087\r\nrelated: #15500\r\nrelated: #17629\r\nrelated: #22407\r\nrelated: #12644\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

we determine if a DAG is a subdag in `airflow.security.permissions.resource_name_for_dag` is not right.\r\nIf a `dag_id` contains a dot, the permission is not recorded correctly.\r\n\r\nThe current solution makes a query every time we check for permission for dags that has a dot in the name. Not that I like it but I think it's better than other options I considered such as changing how we name dags for subdag. That's not\r\ngood in UX. Another option I considered was making a query when parsing, that's not good and it's avoided\r\nby passing `root_dag` to `resource_name_for_dag`\r\n\r\nThis PR is an attempt to fix this\r\n\r\nCloses:

keeps the logic to fail without upgrading when (A) there are bad rows and (B) the \"moved\" table already exists.  But we optimize so that we don't count the bad rows unless the \"moved\" table is there.  Previously we counted _always_, but the first time a user attempts upgrade, the tables won't be there so there's no point in counting.\r\n\r\nInstead what we do is skip right to the CTAS, creating the `_airflow_moved` tables.  If there aren't any rows in the \"moved\" table, then we delete the table immediately.\r\n\r\nAlso included here is a delete optimization, where we join to the moved table instead of running the not exists query again.\r\n\r\nTested on all 4 dialects with small sample data to ensure that behavior is correct.","created_at":"2022-05-04T18:17:01Z","updated_at":"2022-05-08T08:30:59Z","closed_at":"2022-05-06T12:42:22Z","merged_at":"2022-05-06T12:42:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"6cc41abf6912fd2705b9ef7cf368c888c43c8af8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"uranusjr","id":605277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTI3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/605277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr","html_url":"https://github.com/uranusjr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2172803017,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcyODAzMDE3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:bug-fix","name":"type:bug-fix","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog:

links in the UI to `/graph` can currently be broken if you have several runs starting at (basically) the same time. The UI control that airflow uses for base_date only has per-second resolution (it loses everything sub-second), so to account for that the current implementation defaults base_date to exec_date rounded up to the nearest second. The problem occurs when several other dagruns were triggered in that rounded second - those other dagruns are loaded first (up to `num_runs`) so it's possible the requested dagrun does not even get loaded.  I know it sounds like an uncommon scenario but it actually happens to us a lot, as we have several processes that kick off many dagruns at the same time.  \r\n\r\nThis PR maintains the existing rounding behavior for the base_date UI control, but uses the requested exec_date for the database query when the base_date has been rounded. This way the requested dagrun will always be the first record returned, even when base_date has been rounded up.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

is another step in simplifying and converting to Python all of\r\nthe CI/local development tooling.\r\n\r\nThis PR separates out verification of providers as a separate\r\nbreeze command `verify-provider-packages`. It was previously part of\r\n\"prepare_provider_packages.py\" but it has been now\r\nextracted to a separate in-container python file and it was\r\nwrapped with breeze's `verify-provider-packages` command.\r\n\r\nNo longer provider verification is run with \"preparing provider docs\"\r\nnor \"preparing provider packages\" - it's a standaline command.\r\n\r\nThis command is also used in CI now to run the tests:\r\n\r\n* all provider packages are built and created on CI together with\r\n  airflow version\r\n* the packages are installed inside the CI image and providers are\r\n  verified\r\n* the 2.1 version of Airflow is installed together with all 2.1\r\n  - compatible providers and provider verification is run there too.\r\n\r\nThis all is much simpler now - we got rediof some 500 lines of bash\r\ncode again in favour of breeze python code.\r\n\r\nFixes: #23430 \r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

Motivation of the PR\r\n\r\nThis PR allows Kubernetes Pod Operator to run with sidecars containers.\r\n\r\nWhen running the Kubernetes Pod Operator, the task waits until the pod is in a Terminate state. In the case that we are running the Pod Operator with multiple containers, the Pod will not be in a Terminate state until all the containers are in a Terminate state. This is a problem when running the main container among sidecars containers, because in many case this containers doesn't receive the signal to exit. An example would be an envoy container that handles the pod network.\r\n\r\nExample of a Pod with one container in a terminated state. Note that the Pod status is `Running`.\r\n```\r\nName:        ********\r\nNamespace:   ********\r\nPriority:     0\r\nNode:        ********\r\nStart Time:   Thu, 28 Apr 2022 15:50:25 +0200\r\nLabels:       airflow_version=2.1.4\r\n              dag_id=accounts-refresh\r\n              execution_date=2022-04-28T135015.7751980000-8035c9679\r\n              kubernetes_pod_operator=True\r\n              task_id=********\r\n              try_number=1\r\nAnnotations:  [kubernetes.io/psp](http://kubernetes.io/psp): eks.privileged\r\nStatus:       Running\r\nIP:           ********\r\nIPs:\r\n  IP:  ********\r\nContainers:\r\n  base:\r\n    Container ID:   ********\r\n    Image:          ********\r\n    Image ID:       ********\r\n    Port:           <none>\r\n    Host Port:      <none>\r\n    State:          Terminated\r\n      Reason:       Error\r\n      Exit Code:    1\r\n      Started:      Thu, 28 Apr 2022 15:50:26 +0200\r\n      Finished:     Thu, 28 Apr 2022 15:50:30 +0200\r\n    Ready:          False\r\n    Restart Count:  0\r\n    Environment:\r\n      ********\r\n    Mounts:\r\n      /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount from kube-api-access-xnh99 (ro)\r\n  envoy:\r\n    Container ID:   ********\r\n    Image:         ********\r\n    Image ID:       ********\r\n    Port:           <none>\r\n    Host Port:      <none>\r\n    State:          Running\r\n      Started:      Thu, 28 Apr 2022 15:50:26 +0200\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe other part that won't work is the cleanup. At the moment, the task will be marked as failed if the pod is not in the `SUCCEEDED` phase.  When running with sidecars, if the sidecars hasn't stop running, the pod won't be in that state.\r\n\r\n# Changes\r\n\r\nAs we can see in the follow diagram of the run workflow, we don't need to wait until the pod have finished, so I have removed that part. Our base container (the one that is executing the workload) will always be finished when we reach that point.

you add --verbose or --dry-run options to breeze it will\r\nprint the commands it is executing (or is supposed to in dry-run\r\nmode). The output contains environment variables as they\r\noften contain crucial information to execute the command (for\r\nexample in docker-compose run commands it contains COMPOSE_FILE\r\nvariable which is the list of compose files that are used). This\r\nis done in a fashion that you can copy the whole command and\r\nexecute it, but it very unfriendly for visual inspection as\r\nall the variables were printed in one line and in semi-random\r\norder and also the variables contained often all system variables\r\nset by the shell before.\r\n\r\nThis change keeps the proerty of \"we can copy&paste the command\r\nand run it\" but it improves the visual aspect of it:\r\n\r\n1) each env variable is kept in one line\r\n2) first all system variables are printed and then variables that\r\n   were specifically added for this command\r\n3) variables in each group are sorted alphabetically which helps\r\n   in finding the variable you are looking for when you visually\r\n   inspect the output.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/19943\r\n\r\nThis is a first draft, let me know what you think.\r\n\r\n## Changes:\r\n- Filters and Legends Rows are now inside the `Tree` react app and removed from the `tree.html` template\r\n- Added filters on `Dag Run Type` `Run State` and `Task State`.\r\n- Removed `updated` button, fetched is automatically made on filter change. Replaced it with a `Clear Filters` button.\r\n- Updated colors to light blue for a more unified UI.\r\n- Removed the initialData, for `useTreeData` query as it populates cache for queryKeys until `staleTime` is passed. (successiv refetch were not triggered [explanation](https://github.com/tannerlinsley/react-query/discussions/3210#discussioncomment-1990807)\r\n- Changed the `STATE_COLOR.skipped` -> It was too light, and with the new opacity for filtered out task I was hard to tell if it was filtered out or not.\r\n- Spinner while fetching tree data.\r\n- A few tests for the custom hook. (I don't know what is the policy here about tests for this part of the projet, it seems to have very few tested components at the moment).\r\n\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14861206/166157406-2b407ede-ee2e-4b28-a1ca-c927e175e007.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14861206/166157437-8f84fc72-f6d9-4ac5-93f0-c349b0699261.png)\r\n","created_at":"2022-05-01T17:41:45Z","updated_at":"2022-05-20T15:11:10Z","closed_at":"2022-05-09T20:32:03Z","merged_at":"2022-05-09T20:32:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"46c1c006f747798f7c80f615d791553f25dd1770","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ryanahamilton","id":3267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanahamilton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545584474,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTg0NDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:webserver","name":"area:webserver","color":"a9db3f","default":false,"description":"Webserver related Issues"},{"id":2172803017,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcyODAzMDE3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:bug-fix","name":"type:bug-fix","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog: Bug Fixes"},{"id":2451280808,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNDUxMjgwODA4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/full%20tests%20needed","name":"full tests needed","color":"e0c514","default":false,"description":"We need to run full set of tests for this PR to merge"},{"id":2514952451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTE0OTUyNDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:UI","name":"area:UI","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"Related to UI/UX.
