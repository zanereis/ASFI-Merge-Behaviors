that ConsumerRecord.deliveryCount() exists, enhance kafka-console-share-consumer.sh to exploit it. Added support to the DefaultMessageFormatter and the option `print.delivery` to the usage message for `kafka-console-share-consumer.sh`. Note that it was not added to `kafka-console-consumer.sh` even though the option would be recognised - this is because delivery with a consumer group does not count deliveries, and the result would

of waiting until Tasks are assigned to us, we pre-emptively\r\ncreate a `StandbyTask` for each non-empty Task directory found on-disk.\r\n\r\nWe do this before starting any `StreamThread`s, and on our first\r\nassignment (after joining the consumer group), we recycle any of these\r\n`StandbyTask`s that were assigned to us, either as an Active or a\r\nStandby.\r\n\r\nWe can't just use these \"initial Standbys\" as-is, because they were\r\nconstructed outside the context of a `StreamThread`, so we first have to\r\nupdate them with the context (log context, `ChangelogReader`, and source\r\ntopics) of the thread that it has been assigned to.\r\n\r\nThe motivation for this is to (in a later commit) read `StateStore`\r\noffsets for unowned Tasks from the `StateStore` itself, rather than the\r\n`.checkpoint` file, which we plan to deprecate and remove.\r\n\r\nThere are a few additional benefits:\r\n\r\n  1. Initializing these Tasks on start-up, instead of on-assignment, will\r\n     reduce the time between a member joining the consumer group and beginning\r\n     processing. This is especially important when active tasks are being moved\r\n     over, for example, as part of a rolling restart.\r\n\r\n  2. If a Task has corrupt data on-disk, it will be discovered on startup and\r\n     wiped under EOS. This is preferable to wiping the state after being\r\n     assigned the Task, because another instance may have non-corrupt data and\r\n     would not need to restore (as much).\r\n\r\nThere is a potential performance impact: we open _all_ on-disk Task\r\nStateStores, and keep them all open until we have our first assignment.\r\nThis could require large amounts of memory, in particular when there are\r\na large number of local state stores on-disk.\r\n\r\nHowever, since old local state for Tasks we don't own is automatically\r\ncleaned up after a period of time, in practice, we will almost always\r\nonly be dealing with the state that was last assigned to the local\r\ninstance.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation

the discussion:  (https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/11611#discussion_r772625486)\r\n\r\nI did the following three things:\r\n\r\n1. Find all the code that has invoked the `init (ProcessorContext, StateStore)` method. Actually, it is only called in one test class(`MockProcessorContextTest`), then I deleted the relevant test method.\r\n2. Delete the method `init(ProcessorContext, StateStore)` from the `StateStore` and Its implementation classes. If the implementation class contains both methods `init(ProcessorContext, StateStore)` and `init(StateStoreContext, StateStore)` simultaneously, then delete `init(ProcessorContext, StateStore)` directly. If the implementation class only contains methods `init(ProcessorContext, StateStore)`, then I create a new method `init(StateStoreContext, StateStore)` and copy the relevant code to it. There are still many details in the code.\r\n3. The logic of generation of internal topic names in class `TimeOrderedCachingWindowStore` was not repalaced by `ProcessorContextUtils#changelogFor`, I moved it over while I was at it.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

a voter fails as leader (LeaderState) the quorum-state still states that it is the leader of the epoch. When the voter starts it never starts as leader and instead starts as resigned (ResignedState) if it was previously a leader. This causes the KRaft client to immediately notify the state machine (e.g QuorumController) that it is leader or active. This is incorrect for two reasons.\r\n\r\nOne, the controller cannot be notified of leadership until it has reached the LEO. If the controller is notified before that it will generate and append records that are not based on the latest state.\r\n\r\nTwo, it is not practical to notify of local leadership when it is resigned since any write operation (prepareAppend and schedulePreparedAppend) will fail with NotLeaderException while KRaft is in the resigned state.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit

patch fixes a few buts in the replay logic of the consumer group records:\r\n* The first issue is that the logic assumed that the group or the member exists when tombstones are replayed. Obviously, this is incorrect after a restart. The group or the member may not me there anymore if the __consumer_offsets partitions only contains tombstones for the group or the member. The patch fixes this by considering tombstones as no-ops if the entity does not exist.\r\n* The second issue is that the logic assumed that consumer group records are always in a specific order in the log so the logic was only accepting to create a consumer group when `ConsumerGroupMemberMetadata` record is replayed. This is obviously incorrect too. During the life time of a consumer group, the records may be in different order. The patch fixes this by allowing the creating of a consumer group by any record.\r\n* The third issue is that it is possible to replay offset commit records for a specific consumer group before the consumer group is actually created while replying its records. By default the OffsetMetadataManager creates a simple classic group to hold those offset commits. When the consumer offset records are finally replayed, the logic will fail because a classic group already exists. The patch fixes this by converting a simple classic group when records for a consumer group are replayed.\r\n\r\nAll those combinations are hard to test with unit tests. This patch adds an integration tests which reproduces some of those interleaving of records. I used them to reproduce the issues describe above.\r\n\r\nWe really need to work on adding simulation tests for the new group coordinator. I would not have thought about covering the compaction in those but we should do it. We should compact the log and also trigger reload of the coordinator.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test

change fixes the Kafka configuration validation to take into account the reconfiguration changes to configuration and allows KRaft observers to start with an unknown set of voters.\r\n\r\nFor the Kafka configuration validation the high-level change is that now the user only needs to specify either the controller.quorum.bootstrap.servers property or the controller.quorum.voters property. The other notable change in the configuration is that controller listeners can now be (and should be) specified in advertise.listeners property.\r\n\r\nBecause Kafka can now be configured without any voters and just the bootstrap servers. The KRaft client needs to allow for an unknown set of voters during the initial startup. This is done by adding the VoterSet#empty set of voters to the KRaftControlRecordStateMachine.\r\n\r\nLastly the RaftClientTestContext type is updated to support this new configuration for KRaft and a test is added to verify that observers can start and send Fetch requests when the voters are unknown.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2024-08-15T15:47:32Z","updated_at":"2024-08-16T19:53:17Z","closed_at":"2024-08-16T19:53:14Z","merged_at":"2024-08-16T19:53:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"20c3e7324b0fd102382b4c23c86f45fa79cb6690","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2650268685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjUwMjY4Njg1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/kraft","name":"kraft","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":6787634831,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABlJMWjw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/KIP-853","name":"KIP-853","color":"D00CA6","default":false,"description":"KRaft

for the known issue that the logic for updating fetch positions in the new consumer was being performed partly in the app thread, party in the background thread, potentially leading to race conditions on the subscription state. \r\n\r\nThis PR moves the logic for updateFetchPositions to the background thread as a single event (instead of triggering separate events to validate, fetchOffsets, listOffsets). A new UpdateFetchPositionsEvent is triggered from the app thread and processed in the background, where it performs those same operations and updates the subscription state accordingly, without blocking the background thread. \r\n\r\nThis PR maintains the existing logic for keeping a pendingOffsetFetchRequest that does not complete within the lifetime of the updateFetchPositions attempt, and may be used on the next call to updateFetchPositions.\r\n","created_at":"2024-08-15T02:07:56Z","updated_at":"2024-09-15T17:43:45Z","closed_at":"2024-09-15T17:43:45Z","merged_at":"2024-09-15T17:43:45Z","merge_commit_sha":"6744a718c2c177c7d462b231ea5e476d98f6eb38","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":851033232,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTEwMzMyMzI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/consumer","name":"consumer","color":"bf6a03","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4771354362,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABHGUW-g","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/KIP-848","name":"KIP-848","color":"0E87F1","default":false,"description":"The

The actual impl for this class will be done in future PRs.\r\n\r\n### Why\r\n- The share coordinator component has been introduced as part of KIP-932 (QFK). This component is will be responsible for managing persistence for various data related to share partitions into a dedicated internal topic.\r\n- To keep all this functionality contained, we want to create a separate module in line with group and transaction coordinators.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n- No impl code yet, clean build

expire-group-metadata operation generates tombstone records, updates the groups state and decrements group size counters, then performs a write to the log. If there is a __consumer_offsets partition reassignment, for instance, this operation fails. The groups state is reverted to an earlier snapshot but classic group size counters are not. This begins an inconsistency between the metrics and the actual groups size. This applies to all unsuccessful write operations that alter the classic group state.\r\n\r\nHowever, some operations that alter the classic group state do not produce records. This means that we cannot rely on timeline data structures as we do for consumer group states.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation

in KRaft mode, we could request an unclean leader election for a specific topic using\r\nthe electLeaders API. This PR adds an additional way to trigger unclean leader election when in\r\nKRaft mode via static and dynamic configuration.\r\n\r\nIn order to support all possible configuration methods, we have to do a multi-step configuration\r\nlookup process:\r\n1. check the dynamic topic configuration for the topic.\r\n2. check the dynamic node configuration.\r\n3. check the dynamic cluster configuration.\r\n4. check the controller's static configuration.\r\n\r\nFortunately, we already have the logic to do this multi-step lookup in KafkaConfigSchema.java.\r\nThis PR reuses that logic. It also makes setting a configuration schema in\r\nConfigurationControlManager mandatory. (Previously, it was optional for unit tests.)\r\n\r\nOf course, the dynamic configuration can change over time. These changes can make unclean leader\r\nelections possible for partitions that they were not previously possible for. In order to handle\r\nthis case, I generalized maybeBalancePartitionLeaders into maybeAdjustPartitionLeaders. The newly\r\ngeneralized function iterates over all leaderless partitions to see if an unclean leader election \r\ncan be performed. This check runs periodically (by default, every 5 minutes.)\r\n\r\nFinally, this PR adds the UncleanLeaderElectionsPerSec metric.\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Luke Chen

API is changed to separate the batch accumulation (`RaftClient#prepareAppend`) from scheduling the append of accumulated batches (`RaftClient#schedulePrepatedAppend`) to the KRaft log. This change is needed to better match the controller's flow of replaying the generated records before replicating them. When the controller replay records it needs to know the offset associated with the record. To compute a table offset the KafkaClient needs to be aware of the records and their log position.\r\n\r\nThe controller uses this new API by generated the cluster metadata records, compute their offset using RaftClient#prepareAppend, replay the records in the state machine, and finally allowing KRaft to append the records with RaftClient#schedulePreparedAppend.\r\n\r\nTo implement this API the BatchAccumulator is changed to also support this access pattern. This is done by adding a drainOffset to the implementation. The batch accumulator is allowed to return any record and batch that is less than the drain offset.\r\n\r\nLastly, this change also removes some functionality that is no longer needed like non-atomic appends and validation of the base offset.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade
