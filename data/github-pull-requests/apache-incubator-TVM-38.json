`meta_schedule.gpu.conv2d_nchw_winograd_inverse`\r\nwhose function signatures are:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef schedule_rule(\r\n  sch: tvm.tir.Schedule,\r\n  block: tvm.tir.schedule.BlockRV,\r\n) ->

working on enabling \"anchor block\" tuning for MS. This is a utility to extract anchor blocks. \r\n\r\nI define the \"anchor block\" to be the block (1) with an init statement and (2) having the biggest flops count. The latter condition is only used when there are multiple blocks with an init statement.\r\n\r\nFor example, if the input module is conv2d + fused spatial blocks, conv2d is the anchor block. A module created from winograd convolution has multiple blocks with an init statement (input transform, batched GEMM, and output transform). We use the second condition, the flops count, to determine that the batched GEMM block is the anchor block.\r\n\r\ncc @junrushao @Hzfengsy

support to lock and unlock resources on the individual threads.  Adds APIs to get a thread handle for a given resource type, and get a resource type for a given thread handle.  This will aid in asynchronous support that is sending work to dedicated threads for the hardware resources.\r\n\r\nThere are two steps to fully acquire a resource:  reserve and lock.  HTP/HVX manager objects are created on the global thread, which will reserve the resources.  The lock/unlock will occur on the thread that owns a particular instance.  The manager objects will be deconstructed when the thread manager is deconstructed.

the Android Debug Bridge, tries to determine if an emulator is present by looking for port 5555 being open. Unfortunately, once adb thinks there's an emulator running, it will continously try to connect to it, adding an error to its log on every failed attempt. This log file quickly grows to hundreds of gigabytes before developers notice they are completely out of disk space. This problem is further compounded by the Hexagon Launcher forwarding 10 contiguous ports from the randomly-chosen RPC base port, causing this failure to happen more often than you'd otherwise suspect.\r\n\r\nSee https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3152681/android-emulator-5554-offline/10356594#10356594\r\n\r\ncc: @csullivan @mehrdadh @cconvey

motivation behind resource management is to ensure that we release all resources at the end of the session.\r\n\r\nGiven the session management on the client side, it is possible for ReleaseResources to be called before all client side objects have been torn down.  And, it is possible for frees to be called in the window between session end and process termination.  (After those buffers have been freed in ReleaseResources.)\r\n\r\nBased on feedback from @adstraw and @Lunderberg on the usage of \"released_runtime_buffers,\" we did an investigation into the post-release frees.  The cleanest solution is to keep the logic to free all buffers in ReleaseResources, and log a message on any frees that are executed outside a session.","created_at":"2022-10-19T16:16:24Z","updated_at":"2022-10-19T21:47:36Z","closed_at":"2022-10-19T21:46:09Z","merged_at":"2022-10-19T21:46:09Z","merge_commit_sha":"f3ffc32482884452fdb5ea29b09a16291b60841a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/13139/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/13139/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/13139/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/e8dedc04725cf9a10043d56d8232f56af5ae2af3","head":{"label":"janetsc:post_release_free","ref":"post_release_free","sha":"e8dedc04725cf9a10043d56d8232f56af5ae2af3","user":{"login":"janetsc","id":21978033,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTc4MDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21978033?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janetsc","html_url":"https://github.com/janetsc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janetsc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janetsc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janetsc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janetsc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janetsc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janetsc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janetsc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janetsc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janetsc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":530868896,"node_id":"R_kgDOH6RqoA","name":"tvm","full_name":"janetsc/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"janetsc","id":21978033,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTc4MDMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21978033?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janetsc","html_url":"https://github.com/janetsc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janetsc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janetsc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janetsc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janetsc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janetsc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janetsc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janetsc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janetsc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janetsc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/janetsc/tvm","description":"Open

Now that all the pieces have been upstreamed, I'm adding demo tuning scripts under `test_hexagon/metaschedule_e2e`. \r\n\r\nThey are not run on CI, and running it locally requires PyTorch to generate fp16 and int8 resnet50. \r\n\r\nThe scripts use a small number of tuning trials and `replay-trace` search strategy instead of the evolutionary search, to finish tuning quickly.

simplifying a branch of a boolean AND or a boolean OR, the other branch may be assumed not to dominate the result of the operator.  For example, when simplifying `(A and B)`, `A` may be simplified on the assumption that `B` is true.  Similarly, when simplifying `(A or B)`, `A` may be simplified on the assumption that `B` is false.\r\n\r\nPrior to this commit, these constraints were not used for simplifications.  This commit introduced an optional extension, `kApplyConstraintsToBooleanBranches`, which exposes these constraints for simplification.  This isn't enabled by default, as some cases require a second visit to each branch of a boolean operator.  (e.g. Simplifying the LHS of an operator, using a constraint provided by the RHS, where the sub-analyzer that uses the constraint expects it to already be simplified.)","created_at":"2022-10-19T02:43:03Z","updated_at":"2022-10-28T18:36:37Z","closed_at":"2022-10-28T18:36:30Z","merged_at":"2022-10-28T18:36:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"602c194f25d52c8159631e6b1220218624433c40","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/13129/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/13129/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/13129/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/fdd7ada47b5d396f83395e6b84478d5ff4f9f515","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:apply_constraints_to_boolean_branches","ref":"apply_constraints_to_boolean_branches","sha":"fdd7ada47b5d396f83395e6b84478d5ff4f9f515","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

to constructor functions will be placed in section \".ctors\" or \".init_array\" in a binary file.

If we use lld (the LLVM linker) for better runtime performance (such as Link-Time-Optimization) and better compilation efficiency, the constructor functions will not be called, which will cause critical problems.\r\nAdding \"UseInitArray\" option to target_options_ will generate \".init_array\" instead of \".ctors\" at compile time, which will solve this problem.

a pass that analyzes functions partitioned for the NPU and inlines those that are deemed \"non-compute-intensive\" back to the main function so that they can be considered for other backends.

current datatype issue #12997 could cause the postproc application to fail in massive number during evolutionary search, causing tons of exception logging onto the screen via `LOG(WARN)`. This change removes the postproc application exception logging in the utility of search strategy, the reasons are:\r\n1. The errors are triggered in multi-thread environment, the logging is hard to read anyway\r\n2. We have a large population of candidates to mutate and apply postproc, in scenarios like the data type issue, it generates tons of logging, which is not helpful.\r\n3. To debug we always need to run the postproc alone, which doesn’t matter in this case.\r\n4. Without the warning log, we can still see failed postproc number count in the logging, and check for failure if necessary. If all the application fails, we would be able to see the workload fails in the performance tuning table. Example:\r\n```c++\r\n2022-10-13 17:03:42.383 INFO /home/apache/tvm/src/meta_schedule/search_strategy/evolutionary_search.cc:595 Evolve iter # 3 done.

I think this output can potentially cause the same problem, we can address it if we have consensus on the current logging interface change.\r\n\r\nCC @junrushao @vinx13 @masahi

to this commit, any use of negative coefficients in `ModularSet` would result in an error.  This included cases where a constraint is being entered, such as `floormod(i, -2)==0` appearing as the condition of an if/else block.  These negative indices can also arise as intermediate simplification steps produced by `CanonicalSimplifier`, such as `floormod(-i,2)` being canonicalized to `floormod(i,-2)`.\r\n\r\nThis commit adds support for negative coefficients in `ModularSet`, using the same sign convention as is used by `CanonicalSimplifier` for negative denominators, and adds unit tests to verify that sign convention.","created_at":"2022-10-14T14:04:36Z","updated_at":"2022-10-28T14:02:28Z","closed_at":"2022-10-27T22:51:11Z","merged_at":"2022-10-27T22:51:11Z","merge_commit_sha":"0554a46789a6226b14ab309bb10401b6c23b8413","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/13081/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/13081/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/13081/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/297b3afe03d315e8753640020d8ef963b2552cb4","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:modular_set_negative_arg","ref":"modular_set_negative_arg","sha":"297b3afe03d315e8753640020d8ef963b2552cb4","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

goal of this commit is to improve performance for Hexagon target and preserve performance/accuracy for x86, GPU and etc. targets.\r\n\r\n\"qnn.requantize\" operation is lowered into the sequence of multiply, add, shift during QNN canonicalization pass if scale quantization parameter is vector of scalars. This commit adds new Relay per-channel/per-axis FixedPointMultiply operation and is used in \"qnn.requantize\" operation lowering.\r\n\r\nper-channel/per-axis FixedPointMultiply is implemented through tir.q_multiply_shift_per_axis intrinsic. For Hexagon target it overrides default implementation and generate HVX vmpye/vmpyo instruction (see _q_multiply_shift_per_axis_hexagon). For all other targets it uses default implementation (64 bits arithmetic).\r\n\r\n**Performance/accuracy measurement:**\r\n\r\n* _CPU(x86) target_: accuracy and performance are the same. For other targets should be the same (otherwise it is bug).\r\n\r\n* _Hexagon target_: speedup of qnn.requantize 7x-9x times (Snapdragon 888, 4.4 ms -> 0.5 ms)","created_at":"2022-10-14T13:48:32Z","updated_at":"2023-03-29T06:26:01Z","closed_at":"2022-10-27T09:41:42Z","merged_at":"2022-10-27T09:41:42Z","merge_commit_sha":"645a5eafa36ad358a9160f993e849702c82387d7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/13080/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/13080/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/13080/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/62309a6d8aa7aefd6499787036f950cce5587726","head":{"label":"ibsidorenko:fpm-per-channel","ref":"fpm-per-channel","sha":"62309a6d8aa7aefd6499787036f950cce5587726","user":{"login":"ibsidorenko","id":98739392,"node_id":"U_kgDOBeKkwA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98739392?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibsidorenko","html_url":"https://github.com/ibsidorenko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibsidorenko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibsidorenko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibsidorenko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibsidorenko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibsidorenko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibsidorenko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibsidorenko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibsidorenko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibsidorenko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":485713421,"node_id":"R_kgDOHPNmDQ","name":"tvm","full_name":"ibsidorenko/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ibsidorenko","id":98739392,"node_id":"U_kgDOBeKkwA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98739392?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibsidorenko","html_url":"https://github.com/ibsidorenko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibsidorenko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibsidorenko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibsidorenko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibsidorenko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibsidorenko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibsidorenko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibsidorenko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibsidorenko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibsidorenko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ibsidorenko/tvm","description":"Open

Hexagon logging is done with a custom `LogMessageImpl` in` hexagon_common.cc`. This ends up calling `HexagonLog `and `HEXAGON_PRINT` which uses the HAP FARF API. Unfortunately, the TVM log level is lost along the way, with logs being produced at FARF’s `ALWAYS` level. This becomes especially noisy with RPC debug logging, which generates enough noise to cause some log data to be dropped. It also introduces a lot of useless noise, as the FARF API produces its own line number information, which only points to where `hexagon_common.cc` calls `HEXAGON_PRINT`. Using the `HAP_debug_runtime` API lets us pass the log level and file line information directly, and enables runtime selection of logging levels.\r\n\r\nThis commit explicitly passes the log level to `LogMessage`/`LogMessageImpl` and updates Hexagon's custom `LogMessageImpl` to use the `HAP_debug_runtime` API.","created_at":"2022-10-13T23:01:20Z","updated_at":"2022-10-28T19:59:07Z","closed_at":"2022-10-28T18:59:46Z","merged_at":"2022-10-28T18:59:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"c0f33dfb97d9689640c85d2324505299bf43437d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"nverke","id":8889513,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODk1MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8889513?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nverke","html_url":"https://github.com/nverke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nverke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nverke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nverke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nverke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nverke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nverke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nverke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nverke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nverke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/13072/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/13072/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/13072/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/fe1c5ba5073fbfd0cfdcdcc16dc89184157b4ba5","head":{"label":"supersat:improve-hexagon-logging","ref":"improve-hexagon-logging","sha":"fe1c5ba5073fbfd0cfdcdcc16dc89184157b4ba5","user":{"login":"supersat","id":1396229,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzOTYyMjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1396229?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/supersat","html_url":"https://github.com/supersat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/supersat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/supersat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/supersat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/supersat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/supersat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/supersat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/supersat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/supersat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/supersat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":460230499,"node_id":"R_kgDOG26PYw","name":"tvm","full_name":"supersat/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"supersat","id":1396229,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzOTYyMjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1396229?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/supersat","html_url":"https://github.com/supersat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/supersat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/supersat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/supersat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/supersat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/supersat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/supersat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/supersat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/supersat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/supersat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/supersat/tvm","description":"Open
