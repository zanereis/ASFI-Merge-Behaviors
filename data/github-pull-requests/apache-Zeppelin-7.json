What is this PR for?\r\nOptimize the interpreter execution process from the following aspects:\r\n1. Close the interpreter executor thread when restart interpreter;\r\n2. Only close opened interpreter when restart interpreter and create non-existent interpreter when create Interpreter;\r\n3. For spark interpreter, reuse the static innerScalaInterpreter class, in the context of multi sub threads, which is only loaded by the first interpreter;\r\n4. When close spark interpreter, set the inner objects (SparkZeppelinContext and sparkILoop) to empty.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Improvement]\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [ ] - Task\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* Open an issue on Jira https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-5644\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n* Covered by existing unit test\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update?

Import some local ipynb file(notebook1.ipynb) via ‘Import New Note’\r\n\r\n2. Import another ipynb file(notebook2.ipynb) with the same note name(notebook1). This will make some error message because there exists a zeppelin notebook with the same name(notebook1) in the path\r\n\r\n3. Again, import the same ipynb file(notebook2.ipynb) used at step2 without changing note name. Importing notebook process is successfully triggered.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? no\r\n* Is there breaking changes for

What is this PR for?\r\n- The org.eclipse.jetty.websocket.common.WebSocketRemoteEndpoint#blockingWrite method has been to ensure that the websocket sends messages serially by `ReentrantLock` and `WriteBlocket`, so the NotebookSocket.send method does not need to be locked.\r\n- If we lock the NotebookSocket.send method, the NotebookServer#onClose method will be triggered when the NotebookSocket.send method sends a message abnormally. At this time, if there are other threads that need to send messages through the current Websocket Session to preempt the noteSocketMap lock in the ConnectionManager,  It will trigger a deadlock.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Bug Fix]\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [ ] - Task\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* [ZEPPELIN-5572](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-5572)\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n* CI\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update?

What is this PR for?\r\nThe `bin/zeppelin.sh` startup script doesn't fully load the Hadoop classpaths in the same way that `bin/zeppelin-daemon.sh` does. As a result, anything that depends on the Hadoop classpaths being loaded (e.g. Shiro's KnoxJwtRealm) will fail.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nBug Fix/Improvement\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n* Verify that `hadoop classpath` values are added to Zeppelin's java process's classpath.\r\n* Verify that Shiro's KnoxJwtRealm loads correctly when running `USE_HADOOP=true HADOOP_CONF_DIR=/path/to/conf bin/zeppelin.sh`\r\n* Verify that the Zeppelin Docker image still works as expected.\r\n\r\n### Notes:\r\n* The classpath loading logic was copied directly from `bin/zeppelin-daemon.sh`.\r\n* The Zeppelin Docker image uses `bin/zeppelin.sh` as its startup script.  This PR will make it easier for users to extend the Docker image by adding Hadoop to it.  Currently, adding Hadoop requires extensive modifications to get the classpath to load correctly.\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* `bin/zeppelin-daemon.sh` makes loading `HADOOP_CONF_DIR` conditional on `USE_HADOOP` but `bin/zeppelin.sh` previously didn't.  Should `zeppelin.sh` be made to work the same as `zeppelin-daemon.sh` or should it retain loading `HADOOP_CONF_DIR` without checking `USE_HADOOP` for backwards compatibility?\r\n* If this PR looks good, could you kindly apply the 'hacktoberfest-accepted' label?

What is this PR for?\r\n\r\nThis PR change the form type of shell interpreter from SIMPLE to NATIVE, so that ${var} won't be translated into dynamic form. Because ${var} is often used as variable reference, so we should not confuse user in Zeppelin. If user do want to use dynamic form, they can still use local property to override that. e.g.\r\n\r\n```\r\n%sh(form=simple)\r\n\r\necho ${name}\r\n\r\n``` \r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[ Improvement ]\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [ ] - Task\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-5472\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n* Unit test is added.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update?
