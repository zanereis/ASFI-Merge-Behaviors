What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n[HUDI-2475]\r\n  - Across upgrades, metadata table may have to be re-bootstrapped from the\r\n    data table. Usually it is detected by the first write client, and the\r\n    metadata table is fully removed and attempt is made to bootstrap. This\r\n    bootstrapping is deferred if there are pending actions on the timeline\r\n    and until they are resolved. Today, spark write client creates the metadata\r\n    writer for every write. But the metadata writer initialization attempt is made\r\n    only once to avoid fs exists check on every write path. If the metadata\r\n    bootstrapping fails the first time due to pending actions (which is\r\n    usually the case after upgrade), the writer client never tries to\r\n    recreate it again, leading to it not updating the metadata table even\r\n    after bootstrapping by other writers. This is a problem for long running/streaming \r\n    application that don't recreate write client\r\n\r\n- In the multiple writer scenarios, there is a potential for race when bootstrapping the\r\n   metadata table\r\n\r\n[HUDI-2862]\r\nToday table upgrade need is detected by the first write client after upgrade\r\nand if there is write concurrency mode configured it grabs the transaction\r\nlock to protect the table upgrade from other concurrent writers. However, the\r\nfollow on metadata table creation and the initial bootstrapping also needs\r\nsimilar global protection to avoid race in inflight commits and the metadata\r\ntable bootstrapping proces. Made the table upgrade and the follow-on metadata\r\ntable creation and there by the initial bootstrapping process under the\r\ntable level lock to avoid potential race with concurrent writers and other\r\nasync table services.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* SparkRDDWriteClient constructor will no more create the metadata table writer\r\nas it is one time only for the continuous mode and also can potentially race\r\nwith same metadata table bootstrapping from other concurrent writers\r\n\r\n* Made the HoodieTable#getMetadataWriter() to always create the metadata table\r\nand there by attempt bootstrapping if needed to avoid continuous writers\r\nmissing out the metadata table update\r\n\r\n* SparkRDDWriteClient#getTableAndInitCtx() will also attempt to create the\r\nmetadata table just after the table upgrade to bootstrap if needed.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis pull request is a trivial rework / code

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the default config of marker type (`HoodieWriteConfig.MARKERS_TYPE` or `hoodie.write.markers.type`) from `DIRECT` to `TIMELINE_SERVER_BASED` for Spark engine.  The PR also fixes a couple of bugs in the core logic regarding timeline-server-based markers and tests that depend on markers.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Changes the default config of marker type (`HoodieWriteConfig.MARKERS_TYPE` or `hoodie.write.markers.type`) from `DIRECT` to `TIMELINE_SERVER_BASED` for Spark Engine.\r\n- Adds engine-specific marker type configs: Spark -> `TIMELINE_SERVER_BASED`, Flink -> `DIRECT`, Java -> `DIRECT`.\r\n- Uses `DIRECT` markers as well for Spark structured streaming due to timeline server only available for the first mini-batch.\r\n- Fixes the marker creation method for non-partitioned table in `TimelineServerBasedWriteMarkers`.\r\n- Adds the fallback to direct markers even when `TIMELINE_SERVER_BASED` is configured, in `WriteMarkersFactory`: when HDFS is used, or embedded timeline server is disabled, the fallback to direct markers happens.\r\n- Fixes the closing of timeline service.\r\n- Fixes tests that depend on markers, mainly by starting the timeline service for each test.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis change adds the tests around the following aspects:\r\n- Engine-specific marker type configs\r\n- Fallbacks to direct markers in `TestWriteMarkersFactory`\r\n- Write markers for non-partitioned table\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title &

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nListing based rollback of delta commits in MOR table, uses latest file slice to fetch list of log files to be rolledback. With lazy cleaning in multi-writer flow, rollback could happen very late. i.e compaction could have triggered by then. And so we can't use latestFileSlice for rollback. Fixed to use getLatestFileSliceOnOrBefore the commit being rolledback. If not for the fix, we get a validation error thrown from rollback utils since latest file's have base commit time > commit being rolledback. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Fixed rollback utils to use getLatestFileSliceOnOrBefore the commit being rolledback instead of getLatestfileSlice while collecting files to be rolledback for delta commits in MOR. \r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n- Added test to TestHoodieSparkMergeOnReadTableRollback#testLazyRollbackOfFailedCommit\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n

purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nNOTE: This change is stacked on top of #4060 and currently contains all of the commits from it as well. As such, am marking this PR as WIP to advance incrementally merging aforementioned PR first before moving to that one.\r\n\r\nNeutralizing affiliation of the Column Statistics index produced as part of Z-ordering Layout Optimization flow, and re-purposing it as generic \"Column-Stats Index\" (so that it later could be re-used by Hilbert Space curve ordering, etc)\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Replace `Z-index` references w/ `Col-Stats-index`\r\n- Extracted `ColumnStatsIndexHelper` from `ZOrderingIndexHelper`\r\n- Separated all things index from actual Z-ordering\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis pull request is a trivial rework / code cleanup and is already covered by existing tests.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nWith concurrent writer scenarios, there are chances that timeline server might fail the request with IllegalArgExeption since server's timeline state was advanced when compared to that of client's. This is unavoidable in async table services on the same jvm scenario, sharing the write client. Client falls back to inMemoryFileSystemView and eventually the write could succeed or fail (depending on conflict resolution). But the exception gives a notion to the user that the write failed. \r\nSo, putting in a fix to move the log statement to warn level and not error. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Fixed PriorityBasedFileSystemView to do warn log depending on the exception type. \r\n- Also fixed the right exception to be thrown from timeline server. Previously it was IllegalArgumentException and hence was seeing UnCaughtException error msgs from javalin. So, have fixed it to proper BadRequestResponse and intercept the same within PriorityBasedFileSystemView and take actions accordingly. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n*(Please pick

querying Hudi incrementally in hive, we set the start query time of the table. This setting works for all tables with the same name, not only for the tables in the current database. In actual business, it can not be guaranteed that the tables in different databases are different, so it can be realized by setting hoodie.table.name as database name + table name, However, at present, the original value of hoodie.table.name is not consistent in spark SQL, so I want to implement it in this pr\r\n\r\n In addition, I think we can add configuration items when creating tables to support  database name + table name\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\n*The original hoodie.table.name should be maintained in Spark SQL*\r\n\r\n## Brief change

It's useful when storage scheme doesn't support append operation.\r\n\r\n```hoodie.archive.files.merge.batch.size (default 10)```\r\n       The numbers of small archive files are merged at once.\r\n\r\n```hoodie.archive.merge.small.file.limit.bytes (default 20971520)```\r\n       This config sets the archive file size limit below which an archive file becomes a candidate to be selected as such a small file.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Add a new plan named HoodieMergeArchiveFilePlan\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n   \"namespace\":\"org.apache.hudi.avro.model\",\r\n   \"type\":\"record\",\r\n   \"name\":\"HoodieMergeArchiveFilePlan\",\r\n   \"fields\":[\r\n     {\r\n         \"name\":\"candidate\",\r\n         \"type\":[\"null\", {\r\n            \"type\":\"array\",\r\n            \"items\": \"string\"\r\n         }],\r\n       \"default\": null\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n       \"name\":\"mergedArchiveFileName\",\r\n       \"type\":[\"null\", \"string\"],\r\n       \"default\": null\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe use this plan to record which candidate small archives files are merged into which bigger archive file.\r\nIt's useful to deal with merge action failure\r\n\r\n## Code

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nThe backing log format for the metadata table is HFile, a KeyValue type.\r\nSince the key field in the metadata record payload is a duplicate of the\r\nKey in the Cell, the redundant key field in the record can be emptied\r\nto save on the cost.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nIntroduced new config \"hoodie.metadata.recordkey.deduplicate\" to control\r\nthe key deduplication for metadata table.\r\n\r\nWhen the log reader reads metadata table records, materialization of such trimmed\r\nrecords is done before handing the records to the callers.\r\n\r\nThis record field trimming is enabled only for the Metadata table via\r\nnew HoodieMetadataHFileReader and HoodieMetadataHFileDataBlock classes.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nConfig enabled by default - https://github.com/apache/hudi/commit/3c75b5af15f36dcc8ea7b0dbb9408134cca13c82\r\n\r\nUnit test -

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n* Fixed the test not to do compaction for COW table\r\n\r\n* Since the thread pool can pick up the multi writer operations in any order,\r\n   the test is flaky. Added a latch to make it more ordered. Still the thread\r\n   pool count and the order of operation has to be fixed in the test.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *Modify AnnotationLocation checkstyle rule in checkstyle.xml*\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis pull request is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\n- We added locking for table services and clean and rollback with synchronous metadata patch. For these, we take locks separately for metadata table. This patch fixes it to take lock for both metadata table and data table. \r\n\r\nMore context: Prior to metadata table, we were not taking any locks for committing the table services and clean and  rollbacks. So, with metadata table, we added locks just to commit to metadata table. which means that, the order of commits in metadata table could be different than in data table since data table commits are outside the lock. This patch fixes this issue, where in these 4 commits (clustering, compaction, clean and rollback), takes a lock (if multi writer is configured), to commit to both metadata table and data table.

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nLet's say a commit was applied to metadata table, and later was explicitly got rolledback(or rollback of a partially failed commit). Due to spark task failures, there could be more files in rollback metadata when compared to the original commit metadata. Add in a config to metadataConfig  to guard this validation. \r\nWhen payload consistency check is enabled, it will throw exception. If not, it will succeed with warn log entry. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Added a config `_hoodie.metadata.ignore.spurious.deletes` config to guard this validation. Added this to HoodieMetadataConfig. Initially thought of adding it to HoodieCommonConfig, but entire metadata reader code base does not have access to writeconfig (going all the way to FileSystem view instantiation). So, have placed this in HoodieMetadataConfig since it is very specific to metadata table and have made it hidden (starts with \"_\")\r\nBy default set to false. And so, we will just log a warn statement on any such inconsistency. If enabled, will throw an exception. \r\n- Also, moved finalize write before committing to metadata table(in all code paths) so that we reconcile markers before writing to metadata table. \r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - Added test : TestHoodieBackedMetadata#testMetadataPayloadSpuriousDeletes.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nAddressing issues w/ Z-ordering\r\n  - Fixing queries failing w/ enabled Z-ordering and data-skipping (not being able to read `_SUCCESS` as Parquet)\r\n  - Fixing incorrect translation of the original query predicates into Z-index table predicates (see `DataSkippingUtils`)\r\n  - Fixing join merging indexes across commits incorrectly \r\n  - Tidying up (simplifying, clarifying) \r\n\r\nAdditionally, it also addresses the gap of the Data-skipping sequence (leveraging Z-index) not taking into consideration files completely omitted from Z-index, which is practically speaking a guaranteed scenario given that Z-order LO is executed w/in Clustering scope, which is most-likely a) asynchronous, and b) touch only subset of all base-files for most users.\r\n\r\nTo address that, Data-skipping sequence looking up pruned candidate files list is modified to accommodate any base-files omitted from Z-index.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nReferred above \r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nZ-ordering has basic code-coverage, but requires much more expansive one. Working on that.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n       \r\n - [ ] For large changes, please consider breaking it into sub-tasks under an umbrella JIRA.\r\n","created_at":"2021-11-18T02:50:52Z","updated_at":"2021-11-24T19:45:28Z","closed_at":"2021-11-24T18:10:28Z","merged_at":"2021-11-24T18:10:28Z","merge_commit_sha":"60b23b979739601f413cdc30da1eae0c18fcb5e6","assignee":{"login":"vinothchandar","id":1179324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzkzMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1179324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar","html_url":"https://github.com/vinothchandar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"vinothchandar","id":1179324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzkzMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1179324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar","html_url":"https://github.com/vinothchandar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2610270804,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjEwMjcwODA0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/priority:blocker","name":"priority:blocker","color":"78FA72","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/4026/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/4026/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/4026/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/statuses/7211f8b2c0c86f69066c8a9f15f3ccdcef57dbe9","head":{"label":"onehouseinc:ak/zord-fix","ref":"ak/zord-fix","sha":"7211f8b2c0c86f69066c8a9f15f3ccdcef57dbe9","user":{"login":"onehouseinc","id":79297158,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjc5Mjk3MTU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79297158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc","html_url":"https://github.com/onehouseinc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":378248722,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzgyNDg3MjI=","name":"hudi","full_name":"onehouseinc/hudi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"onehouseinc","id":79297158,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjc5Mjk3MTU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79297158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc","html_url":"https://github.com/onehouseinc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onehouseinc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.co
