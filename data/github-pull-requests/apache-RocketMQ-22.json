checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

is also optimized. ```DefaultMQAdminExtImpl``` has a lot of additions, deletions, modification and query operations, but many operations are implemented through serial traversal. 5.0.0-beta has completed some parallel improvements to the API, such as the implementation of various Concurrent suffixes, but some are still serially OK, such as ```cleanUnusedTopic```, the following current serial APIs need to be changed to concurrent execution in ```DefaultMQAdminExtImpl```\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nXX\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nDefaultMQAdminExtTest#xxxxConcurrent \r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

RocketMQ同机房就近生产和消费机制。\r\n\r\n\r\nRocketMQ注册、发现机制\r\n- Broker\r\n  - 间隔30秒发送broker上的Topic全量信息到所有Nameserv。broker启动的时候也是延迟注册到Namesrv上的。当有topic发生变更时TopicConfigManager.dataVersion发生变更。\r\n  - 当有topic创建和更新时，broker立刻发送Topic增量信息到所有Namesrv。同时触发Namesrv的BrokerLiveInfo.dataVersion发生变更。\r\n- Namesrv\r\n  - 保存集群和broker关系、broker信息（brokerName和地址）、broker真实连接和topic版本号，topic信息。\r\n  - 调度线程每10秒钟检查一次，如果发现一个broker 120秒都没有更新注册信息，则删除和这个broker相关的所有信息。\r\n- Producer&Consumer\r\n  - Producer第一次发送Message时，会同步向namesrv请求topic路由信息\r\n  - Consumer启动过程中会向namesrv请求topic路由信息\r\n  - 每隔30秒向namesrv拉取一次topic路由信息，根据路由信息内容（不是版本号）判断是否变化，发生变化更新\r\n- 总结：\r\nProducer第一次发送消息时会同步向namesrv请求topic路由信息，然后默认轮询往每个Queue发送消息。\r\nConsumer启动时获取topic路由信息，然后请求broker获取consumer实例列表，最后根据consumer的数量和负载均衡算法给consumer分配queue。\r\n\r\n### 实现rocketmq同机房就近生产和消费：\r\n1.broker增加一个zoneName标识配置，slave的zoneName保持和master相同，通过heartbeat注册到namesrv上。\r\n2.Producer和Consumer可以通过API或者环境变量、系统变量设置zoneName和zoneMode(这是一个开关)。\r\n3.Producer和Consumer获取topic路由信息时，在namesrv上返回对应标识的broker信息。\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4252409/170472929-85f56a48-ab10-4bbc-b241-72029256b5ec.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4252409/170473144-8728e41d-4d69-4248-b690-0fbec426ccbe.png)\r\n\r\n### 功能开启方式\r\nbroker启动增加系统参数\r\n-Drocketmq.zone=bj\r\n\r\nproducer或者consumer启动增加系统参数\r\n-Drocketmq.zone=bj\r\n-Drocketmq.zone.mode=true

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

mod\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nXX\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

readable](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/4087)\r\n\r\nJust found out that the issue proposer had sent out PR a month ago, but he closed it then. Don't know why, but I think it is reasonable and worth making this minor change.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nImprove the readability of AsyncTraceDispatcher.traceProducer\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass.

and introduce the confirmOffset mechanism.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

independent from name-srv and can be deployed independently\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass.

this change\r\n\r\nXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass.

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass.

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

sure set the target branch to `develop`**\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAdd a rough guide for RocketMQ deployment, include three different environments:\r\n- Run RocketMQ locally\r\n- Run RocketMQ in Docker\r\n- Run RocketMQ in Kubernetes\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nadd a rough guide for quick start\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass.

What is the purpose of the change\r\ntracking issue: https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/4330\r\n\r\nWe want unified log replication, using rocketmq's original HaService instead of dledger mode.\r\nPreviously, I have done the following job with @RongtongJin\r\n\r\n- Add statemachine mode for dledger: https://github.com/openmessaging/dledger/pull/128\r\n- Embed a strongly consistent controller based on dledger in name-srv: https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/pull/4195\r\n- Add a new HaService -- AutoSwitchHAService, which use new log replicating protocol to support switch role in haService level.: https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/pull/4236\r\n\r\n**This pr is the last pr**: connecting the interface of Dledger-controller at the Broker level, so that the Broker has the ability of master-slave switching\r\n\r\n**Noted that this Pr is still in development and not fully completed.**\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\nThe architecture is shown in the figure below. The pr is a link between the 'DledgerController' and 'AutoSwitchHASerivce' through a new component - ReplicasManager, it connects to the api of the controller and notifies the lower AutoSwitchHASerivce.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"691\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58988019/167562365-a083f415-1701-425f-92cc-eb72eb2b3f0c.png\">\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily.

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass.

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

sure set the target branch to `develop`**\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix #4326 \r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass.

us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

sure set the target branch to `develop`**\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nIn rip-29, we hope to use topic route cache to speed up route query, but in fact, in large-scale clusters (300 + brokers, 10000 + topics every broker), this optimization will affect registration and cause nameserver crash. So I remove the topic route cache and add switches for some performance-consuming calls.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nRemove the topic route cache and add switches for some performance-consuming calls.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

change\r\n\r\nXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

What is the purpose of the change\r\ntracking issue: https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/4330\r\n\r\nWe want unified log replication, using rocketmq's original HaService instead of dledger mode.\r\nPreviously, i have done the following job with @RongtongJin \r\n1. Add statemachine mode for dledger: https://github.com/openmessaging/dledger/pull/128\r\n2. Embed a strongly consistent controller based on dledger implementation in name-srv: https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/pull/4195\r\n\r\nIn this pr, I added a haService - AutoSwitchHAService that can switch role, this ha can cooperate with the controller to achieve master-slave switching\r\n\r\nIn the follow-up work, I will modify the code of the broker to fully realize the master-slave switch\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nThe ha service protocol is:\r\n![主从复制](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58988019/166210140-ed82e24f-4279-46c5-bca3-dd68a250ebec.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).\r\n","created_at":"2022-05-02T09:26:47Z","updated_at":"2022-05-19T02:34:06Z","closed_at":"2022-05-06T08:34:27Z","merged_at":"2022-05-06T08:34:27Z","merge_commit_sha":"911ee340cb502645cd75603f44ba72c198611434","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1373252893,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzczMjUyODkz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/labels/soc","name":"soc","color":"ffcce9","default":false,"description":"Summer

What is the purpose of the change\r\nWe want unified log replication, using rocketmq's original HaService instead of dledger mode.\r\nPreviously, i have done the following job with @RongtongJin \r\n1. Add statemachine mode for dledger: https://github.com/openmessaging/dledger/pull/128\r\n2. Embed a strongly consistent controller based on dledger implementation in name-srv: https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/pull/4195\r\n\r\nIn this pr, I added a haService - AutoSwitchHAService that can switch role, this ha can cooperate with the controller to achieve master-slave switching\r\n\r\nIn the follow-up work, I will modify the code of the broker to fully realize the master-slave switch\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nThe ha service protocol is:\r\n![主从复制](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58988019/166210140-ed82e24f-4279-46c5-bca3-dd68a250ebec.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).\r\n","created_at":"2022-05-02T09:06:41Z","updated_at":"2022-05-02T09:07:08Z","closed_at":"2022-05-02T09:07:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4cfd07dbc0582ee73aae29fad1e706853941067d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/4235/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/4235/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/4235/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/statuses/541b87909abb10c872ba54c0bf97a7bfb050ad4c","head":{"label":"hzh0425:feature/new-log-replicating","ref":"feature/new-log-replicating","sha":"541b87909abb10c872ba54c0bf97a7bfb050ad4c","user":{"login":"hzh0425","id":58988019,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4OTg4MDE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/58988019?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzh0425","html_url":"https://github.com/hzh0425","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzh0425/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzh0425/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzh0425/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzh0425/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzh0425/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzh0425/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzh0425/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzh0425/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzh0425/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":487777208,"node_id":"R_kgDOHRLjuA","name":"rocketmq","full_name":"hzh0425/rocketmq","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hzh0425","id":58988019,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4OTg4MDE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/58988019?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzh0425","html_url":"https://github.com/hzh0425","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzh0425/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzh0425/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzh0425/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzh0425/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzh0425/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzh0425/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzh0425/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzh0425/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzh0425/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hzh0425/rocketmq","description":"Mirror

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License
