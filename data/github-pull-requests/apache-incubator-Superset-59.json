SUMMARY\r\nSince the legacy TabbedSqlEditor component uses `UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps` lifecycle method to update the state for `editorQueries` and `dataPreviewQueries`, which **only** consumes in the result panel.\r\nThis can also violate the maximum update depth exceeded in some point. \r\n\r\nThis commit deprecates `UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps` implementation and moves to the SouthPane connector where it actually needs.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore:\r\n<img width=\"715\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-10-11 at 11 00 46 AM\"

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently Gamma users have read and write permissions for Alerts & Reports and menu access for \"Alerts & Reports\". However, since they don't have access to the \"Manage\" menu, they can't see the menu item. This means that they can actually access the list view if the URL is provided to them. In addition, the list view shows all entries in the report schedule, although users are only able to edit entries they own.\r\n\r\nThis PR does the following:\r\n- Removes \"can read on ReportSchedule\", \"can write on ReportSchedule\" and \"Alerts & Report\" permissions from Gamma users\r\n- Adds a new base filter to only show owned entries for users without the `all_datasource_access` perm\r\n- Adds tests to assert that admin, alpha and gamma users see the all entries in the list view (admin sees all, alpha sees all, gamma with extra perms only sees owned entries)\r\n- If the user doesn't have edit rights (=isn't owner or isn't Admin) do the following:\r\n  - disable the toggle\r\n  - remove trashcan\r\n  - replace \"Edit\" + Pen icon with \"View\" + Binoculars icon\r\n- Adds an entry to `UPDATING.md` with instructions on how to give perms to Gamma users\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\nWhen an Alpha user enters the list view, non-owned objects will appear with the toggle disabled, no trashcan and the \"Edit\" + Pen replaced with \"View\" + Binoculars (note that I didn't change the modal by dsabling fields etc, as changing that is a slightly bigger effort):\r\n<img width=\"1668\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/195788432-9a1560fe-b7ad-4f4e-b2f7-7bdd1e66cb13.png\">\r\n\r\nWhen a regular Gamma user tries to access the Alerts & Reports list view with the direct URL, they get an \"Access denied\" error:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/195040780-a5a5c65a-ded8-4c3e-bbc0-65253ce7d1eb.png)\r\n\r\nWhen a Gamma user with the `read on ReportSchedule` perm accesses the list view, they can only see their own entries in the list view, despite there being four entries in the report schedule (see the Before screenshot):\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/195040724-e98542af-37ab-4fdd-9907-ae075eae2270.png)\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\nPreviously the Gamma and Alpha user saw and were able to edit all users' entries, despite not being able to change them (here I'm trying to enable another user's alert as a Gamma user, which fails due to missing perms).\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/195040833-0b535e16-483a-4d18-85b3-18ca2e3ab5b5.png)\r\n\r\nPreviously Gamma users were able to access the list view if they knew the URL, despite not having menu access:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/195040879-23e75e09-7aa8-4712-bd24-90cb22cef4ba.png)\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/releases\">react-router-dom's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>react-router-dom@6.4.0-pre.15</h2>\n<h3>Patch Changes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>fix: remove internal router singleton (<a href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/tree/HEAD/packages/react-router-dom/issues/9227\">#9227</a>)</p>\n<p>This change removes the internal module-level <code>routerSingleton</code> we create and maintain inside our data routers since it was causing a number of headaches for non-simple use cases:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unit tests are a pain because you need to find a way to reset the singleton in-between tests\n<ul>\n<li>Use use a <code>_resetModuleScope</code> singleton for our tests</li>\n<li>...but this isn't exposed to users who may want to do their own tests around our router</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The JSX children <code>&lt;Route&gt;</code> objects cause non-intuitive behavior based on idiomatic react expectations\n<ul>\n<li>Conditional runtime <code>&lt;Route&gt;</code>'s won't get picked up</li>\n<li>Adding new <code>&lt;Route&gt;</code>'s during local dev won't get picked up during HMR</li>\n<li>Using external state in your elements doesn't work as one might expect (see <a href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/tree/HEAD/packages/react-router-dom/issues/9225\">#9225</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Instead, we are going to lift the singleton out into user-land, so that they create the router singleton and manage it outside the react tree - which is what react 18 is encouraging with <code>useSyncExternalStore</code> anyways! This also means that since users create the router - there's no longer any difference in the rendering aspect for memory/browser/hash routers (which only impacts router/history creation) - so we can get rid of those and trim to a simple <code>RouterProvider</code></p>\n<pre lang=\"jsx\"><code>// Before\nfunction App() {\n  &lt;DataBrowserRouter&gt;\n    &lt;Route path=&quot;/&quot; element={&lt;Layout /&gt;}&gt;\n      &lt;Route index element={&lt;Home /&gt;}&gt;\n    &lt;/Route&gt;\n  &lt;DataBrowserRouter&gt;\n}\n<p>// After\nlet router = createBrowserRouter([{\npath: &quot;/&quot;,\nelement: &lt;Layout /&gt;,\nchildren: [{\nindex: true,\nelement: &lt;Home /&gt;,\n}]\n}]);</p>\n<p>function App() {\nreturn &lt;RouterProvider router={router} /&gt;\n}\n</code></pre></p>\n<p>If folks still prefer the JSX notation, they can leverage <code>createRoutesFromElements</code> (aliased from <code>createRoutesFromChildren</code> since they are not &quot;children&quot; in this usage):</p>\n<pre lang=\"jsx\"><code>let routes = createRoutesFromElements(\n  &lt;Route path=&quot;/&quot; element={&lt;Layout /&gt;}&gt;\n    &lt;Route index element={&lt;Home /&gt;}&gt;\n  &lt;/Route&gt;\n);\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nSince there is \"Prototype Pollution\" in minimist(< 1.2.6), we need to upgrade to 1.2.6. Currently we have two dependecy chains: \r\n- minimist (0.0.5) -> sharkdown -> @mapbox/geojson-rewind -> mapbox-gl(0.53.1)\r\n- minimist (0.0.8) -> react-map-gl (4.1.16) -> mapbox-gl(0.54.1)\r\n\r\nSo just upgrading react-map-gl  and mapbox-gl can resolve the issue. However, react-map-gl has break change in version 7 (https://visgl.github.io/react-map-gl/docs/upgrade-guide), we upgrade to version 6 to avoid major changes„ÄÇ\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nSince the rendering refactoring by #20877, the number of redundant rendering reduced.\r\nThe FilterableTable re-rendering reduced related to the unnecessary property update but it wasn't reloaded when height is updated. It's mainly caused by functional component refactoring at #21136 which uses `useRef` to capture the height so it won't refreshed with the updated `height` prop properly.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/EugeneTorap/superset/blob/66b704c13ae5b3840109c584989b1248cafb86e1/superset-frontend/src/components/FilterableTable/index.tsx#L335-L336\r\n\r\nThis occurs the empty result-set problem due to react-virtualized rendering issue with `NaN` height value.\r\n\r\nThis commit fixes the rendering issue with the updated height value.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR

It might be caused by transient errors and the error is already gone after opening the dashboard again. In this case, there is no way to know what exactly happened and why we got the errors. Adding an option to log those errors to help debug issues and improve systems, and also reveal the errors to users to understand what happens.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n#### Case 1\r\n##### Before\r\n![screenshot_before_1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105950525/194399027-5805c1fb-84e4-4b01-a785-4091b532dc7e.png)\r\n##### After \r\n![screenshot_after_1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105950525/194399084-b76f25b0-0a5b-412a-80ac-5c0e69f9f1a3.png)\r\n#### Case 2\r\n##### Before\r\n![screenshot_before_2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105950525/194399166-64c7a2d3-3f02-472e-a660-0c87bfd8c58f.png)\r\n##### After\r\n![screenshot_after_2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105950525/194399196-073083b8-29ca-4327-bf58-5e63b4cab0b2.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nTested locally with some broken dashboards.

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/pull/9484 made it so any chart saved to a dashboard has its owners updated to include all owners of the parent dashboard.  However, during the handling of the `PUT /api/v1/dashboard/{pk}` endpoint, `update_chart_owners` is called on all charts present in `dashboard.slices` before `dashboard.slices` is updated based on the charts preset in the parsed `json_metadata` contained in the request.  As a result, when deleting charts from a dashboard, those charts have the dashboard owners added as owners.  This PR changes execution order so `dashboard.slices` is updated before `update_chart_owners` is called, preventing owners from being updated on charts being deleted from dashboards.\r\n\r\nNOTE: This does raise the question of how charts ended up on the dashboard in the first place without having the dashboard owners added as chart owners, as `update_chart_owners` is called on every create/update dashboard command.  It looks like saving a chart to a dashboard from Explore doesn't have an analogous subroutine, so if you have overwrite privileges on a chart and save it to a dashboard that has other owners, those owners won't be added as owners of the chart.  If we really need all charts to have dashboard owners as chart owners, we should probably look into this further.  Either way, I think this fix is still relevant, because even if we do want dashboard owners to also be owners of all their charts, this shouldn't be applied when a chart is deleted from the dashboard.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n**Before:**\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13007381/194379164-1b221bca-4ddc-44e7-a2aa-f03d0fca780c.mov\r\n\r\n**After:**\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13007381/194379238-7f1761dd-49e3-47c7-872a-46df031f0dc7.mov\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR intends to support the `None` operand with `Equal` and `Not-Equal` operators in Filters in QueryObject. Currently, the `In` operator has supported `None` operand calculation, in order to align that the `Equal` and` Not-Equal` should support as well.\r\n \r\nAfter the PR, there are 4 approaches to generate `is null` or `is not null` filter in SQL.\r\n\r\n1. `EQUAL` / `NOT EQUAL` operator\r\n```Python\r\n>>> result = mock_dataset.query({\r\n    \"metrics\": [\"count\"],\r\n    \"filter\": [{\"col\": \"col\", \"val\": None, \"op\": \"==\"}],\r\n    \"is_timeseries\": False,\r\n})\r\n>>> result.query\r\nSELECT count(*) AS count\r\nFROM mock_dataset\r\nWHERE col IS NULL\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. `IS NULL` / `IS NOT NULL` operator\r\n```Python\r\n>>> result = mock_dataset.query({\r\n    \"metrics\": [\"count\"],\r\n    \"filter\": [{\"col\": \"col\", \"op\": \"IS NULL\"}],\r\n    \"is_timeseries\": False,\r\n})\r\n>>> result.query\r\nSELECT count(*) AS count\r\nFROM mock_dataset\r\nWHERE col IS NULL\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. `IN` operator\r\n```Python\r\n>>> result = mock_dataset.query({\r\n    \"metrics\": [\"count\"],\r\n    \"filter\": [{\"col\": \"col\", val: [\"a\", None], \"op\": \"IN\"}],\r\n    \"is_timeseries\": False,\r\n})\r\n>>> result.query\r\nSELECT count(*) AS count\r\nFROM mock_dataset\r\nWHERE col IS NULL\r\n  OR col IN ('a')\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. There is an additional case that `<NULL>` as filter operand literal constant in the EQ or IN operators\r\n```Python\r\n>>> result = mock_dataset.query({\r\n    \"metrics\": [\"count\"],\r\n    \"filter\": [{\"col\": \"col\", \"val\": '<NULL>', \"op\": \"==\"}],\r\n    \"is_timeseries\": False,\r\n})\r\n>>> result.query\r\nSELECT count(*) AS count\r\nFROM mock_dataset\r\nWHERE col IS NULL\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nAddition to #21422 issue\r\n\r\n\"Edit chart\" from dashboard may not work if the dashboard context is not found in localStorage.\r\nIt's specially missing `filterBox` metadata due to the lack of exploreFormData mapping in [mergeFilterBoxToFormData](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/7b66e0bb3461ba05afddda3e8cd127456b4f3691/superset-frontend/src/explore/controlUtils/getFormDataWithDashboardContext.ts#L87).\r\n\r\n<img

users either don't have localStorage enabled in there browser (unlikely) or copied the link in the different browser.\r\n\r\nThis commit fixes this issue by using the original explore formData if dashboardContextFormData is empty.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n- Before\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1121\" alt=\"Notification_Center\"

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently the `key-value` commands are logging exceptions despite reraising the exception. This causes unnecessary noise on logs if the caller is anticipating a failure, which can be caught by the reraised `KeyValue(Get|Create|Delete|Update)FailedError` if needed. In addition, the Upsert command didn't have an exception of its own, and was not catching the `KeyValueCreateFailedError` exception, causing an expected `ValueError` to go unnoticed: https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/de444d4de6a917af8f8efe2335fb1a26ac86e6d8/superset/key_value/commands/create.py#L82-L88\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis PR fixes a bug introduced by (https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/21186) that caused async queries to always render a refetch button on the first query fetch. This is because the first time an async query is run it doesn't have a prevQuery (previous query). Once the query is run (refetched through the button), there's an existing prevQuery so it would always work on the second click.\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n#### BEFORE:\r\n![unsuccessfulAsyncFetch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55605634/193934856-6379058d-d3fa-4b9c-a585-38def24cc5f6.gif)\r\n\r\n#### AFTER:\r\n![successfulAsyncFetch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55605634/193934504-d7090249-0b80-4002-8fde-5b78eee3a552.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n- Ensure that you have a database with `Asynchronous query execution` enabled\r\n- Go to SQL Lab and select a database, schema, and table schema\r\n  - I used a Google Sheets db for testing locally\r\n- Observe that the query runs without having to click \"Fetch data preview\" or \"Refetch results\" first.\r\n\r\nNote: This also happens in the result set when you click \"run\", but that route is currently blocked. There is a fix available for this route here: https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/21667 - I pulled down this branch and tested, I can confirm that this also works for running queries and getting a full result (not just a table preview).\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n* Saves template parameters when query is saved.\r\n* Updates frontend to use v1 saved query rest api, \r\n* Removes unnecessary parameters from the payload which api doesn't need.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n1. Enable `ENABLE_TEMPLATE_PROCESSING` flag\r\n2. write any query in sqllab with params eg.: `SELECT '{{ p1 }}'` and set parameters `{\"p1\": \"value from params\"}`\r\n3. save the query and **close the tab** then go to saved queries\r\n4. when saved query is opened, paramter values should show up exactly as it was saved, and when query is run it should show 1 column with value `value from params`\r\n5. updating the query with sql or parameters should correctly update the query.\r\n6. also test changing the query name, and it should update tab name.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [x] Has associated issue: #20576\r\n- [x] Required

SUMMARY\r\nThis commit fixes the async query broken issue on #21656\r\n\r\nIn #21320, it updated the following code \r\n\r\n```diff\r\n---624      runQuery={this.runQuery}\r\n+++540      runQuery={startQuery}\r\n```\r\nwhich skips the following `startQuery` with empty args operation.\r\n```\r\n/// 422\r\n  runQuery() {\r\n    if (this.props.database) {\r\n      this.startQuery();\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nThis different payload broke the async query request.\r\nThis commit reverts back this origin logic.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n-

allow query mutator to update queries after splitting original sql\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nThe changes allow a user to use the SQL_QUERY_MUTATOR function to add statements such as SET ROLE without breaking functionality. Currently, adding a statemen like this works fine in the SQL Editor, but Charts run individual statements by splitting a passed query and throw errors since SET ROLE does not return any data on its own. With the new MUTATE_AFTER_SPLIT variable, users can choose to apply the mutator function after the chart's query execution function splits a given query, allowing users to apply a change to all statements in a query and have Chart functionality not be interrupted.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nIn the config file, update the SQL_QUERY_MUTATOR function to add a statement which does not return any results on its own and is something which should be run alongside all other statements in a given query. An example of this is adding a SET ROLE statement to the beginning of a query. Create a new Chart and see if queries return errors due to no data being fetched. Now in the config file, add a MUTATE_AFTER_SPLIT variable and set it equal to True. Create a new Chart and make a query, and verify that the desired results are showing.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes

SUMMARY\r\nThis is a quick fix that should apply time grain when Generic Axis is enabled. The Power Query should get more consideration and code design in the future so that share the same unit test and codebase with `connections.model.sqla` and logic.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe column in the `X-Axis` control is designed as a time column when `Generic Axis` is enabled. The `Time Grain` control should apply a time truncation function to the `X-Axis` column. This feature has been implemented in the **virtual dataset** and the **physical dataset** but can't use in Power Query mode.\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n#### Before\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2016594/192987619-c7f948eb-1051-44f6-a180-8fd70c19cd4b.mov\r\n\r\n#### After\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2016594/192988248-23318254-14ec-4244-9279-669ed17c2aa6.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nBefore generating sqlalchemy query, we want standardized how the column objects are annotated. Right now `Query` stores  columns as a `dict` and as we incorporate `Datasets` it will get confusing because the column object won't have the same schema. To fix this I'm refactoring the ExploreMixin to have `self.columns` to be converted into a `List[SLColumn]` to make easier to generate the sqlaquery query downstream.\r\n\r\nAlso i'm incorporating some unit test around the column conversion logic\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

commit removes the `currentQueryEditor` selector and moved into AceEditorWrapper where the actual values are consumed.\r\nThis commit also introduces `useQueryEditor` hook which supports a syntax validation that helps to optimize the queryEditor value access.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

That however, caused the component to always work with the initial database passed as prop and never take into account new user selections. Which you might evidence for example with empty table dropdown after changing DB.\r\n\r\nWe're bringing that feature back with this fix. Also we're using the right props in our tests and adding a new one to consider the re-renders with new database.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED
