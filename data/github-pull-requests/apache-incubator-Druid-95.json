some column names are empty in the header row, the field name becomes an empty string, thereby causing unexpected behaviors in index tasks. With this patch, empty columns have an auto-generated name based on their ordinal number in the header row. For example, given a header row of ```timestamp,foo,,bar```, the field names will be \"timestamp\", \"foo\", \"column_3\", and \"bar\".\r\nAlso, I did some refactoring for CSVParser and DelimitedParser to reduce code duplication.\n\n<!-- Reviewable:start -->\n---\nThis change isâ[<img src=\"https://reviewable.io/review_button.svg\" height=\"34\" align=\"absmiddle\"

https://github.com/druid-io/druid/issues/4402. \r\n\r\nThis patch further splits the travis test into 4 jobs each of which is for running strict compilation, processing module tests, non-processing modules test, and integration tests, respectively. Tests for processing module takes about 10 mins on travis which is about 25% of the total testing time. Strict compilation also takes more than 5 mins on travis.\r\n\r\nWith this patch, we cannot exploit the advantage of fail fast strategy, but our tests will be safer.\n\n<!-- Reviewable:start

is an attempt to clarify questions about what is and is not a public API (see https://github.com/druid-io/druid/pull/4131#discussion_r108780846, https://github.com/druid-io/druid/pull/4394#discussion_r123125180, https://github.com/druid-io/druid/pull/4254#discussion_r121013256). It adds two new annotations: `@ExtensionPoint` which signifies something you can subclass, and `@PublicApi` which signifies something you're not meant to subclass, but that you can use for implementation. The idea is that if an extension author sticks to public APIs then their extension will keep working for at least an entire major Druid line.\r\n\r\nExtension authors are of course free to use non-public APIs, but their extensions might break randomly.\r\n\r\nFeedback on the specific list of annotated and non-annotated items is welcome.\r\n\r\nSome notes:\r\n\r\n- The list of public apis is somewhat subjective, but I did my best guess based on the current contents of http://druid.io/docs/latest/development/modules.html and based on recent discussions about what is and isn't public. In general I erred on the side of annotating _fewer_ rather than _more_ entities, since I figured that annotating too many entities would make too much friction for dev of core Druid.\r\n- Speaking of subjectivity: relating to the last comment in the list above (https://github.com/druid-io/druid/pull/4254#discussion_r121013256) I actually think CSVParseSpec shouldn't be considered a public api, since it's not really useful for extensions. So, I didn't annotate it. Tranquility does use it, but Tranquility really blatantly uses a ton of private Druid APIs. It should really have no expectation of being able to run with any Druid release other than the one it was built with.\r\n- Nothing in java-util is annotated since the annotations are in druid-api, and java-util doesn't depend on druid-api. We could deal with this by either saying \"everything in java-util is public\", or alternatively, creating a new package druid-annotations that java-util and druid-api both depend on.\r\n- I'm not sure I got the annotations for the query metrics stuff right (see #3954). @leventov could you double check if I captured your intent?

specify the listDelimiter to split multiValue before, also when listDelimiter = null, it is set to â\\^Aâ by default. \r\nHowever, when the user's value contains \"\\^A\", and do not want to treat it as a separator, they encountered trouble.\r\n\r\nSo `multiValueDelimiter` comes to figure it out.\r\nThe `multiValueDelimiter` is a map of dimension->delimiter pairs, it can specify the delimiter

delimiter is \"\\^B\" and col3 has no delimiter(do not split).\r\nIf the multiValueDelimiter is null, the listDelimiter goes into effect.\r\nIf the multiValueDelimiter is an empty map, that means

Guys,\r\n\r\nThis PR adds support for the Date logical type from Parquet. Currently only binary strings are supported, which are interpreted and converted to a date using joda time. I found this problem when trying to ingest the date, but Druid interpreted it as seconds since epoch, instead of days since epoch. Therefore it was not able to map it to the correct bucket.\r\n\r\nBy looking at the schema, we extract the Date represented as a INT32. This INT32 represents the number of days since epoch. We construct an Joda Datetime out of it and return it.\r\n\r\nThis will increase the speed and efficiency of both Druid and Parquet. Since a INT32 is faster to write/read and compresses much better than a binary field.\r\n\r\nA logical step would be to also include the Timestamp field, but this is rather difficult since it is stored by many big-data systems such as hive and impala as an INT96. This is [not yet supported by parquet-mr](https://github.com/apache/parquet-mr/blob/master/parquet-avro/src/main/java/org/apache/parquet/avro/AvroSchemaConverter.java#L279). This should be [fixed by Spark 2.2](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-10364), and I'm happy to integrate it by then.\r\n\r\nI've added tests by generating some data using `spark-shell`:\r\n```\r\nimport spark.implicits._\r\n\r\nval range = (1 to 100)\r\nval rdd = sc.parallelize(range)\r\nval df =

#4403 \r\n\r\nQuery metrics should only be used within a single thread. Because results for JDBC queries can be paginated into multiple JDBC frames (each frame being processed by a potentially different thread), the final frame thread that closes the yielder (which results in a QueryMetrics emit() call) may not be the same as the first frame thread that created the yielder (which initializes QueryMetrics with the current thread as the owner). \r\n\r\nThis PR creates and closes the yielder for JDBC results with a single-thread executor to prevent this from

#3628 intermediate result buffers are eagerly allocated on broker and router nodes, where they could be used only on groupBy strategy v1 queries, as far as I can understand. It makes problematic to configure a lot of processing threads (to mitigate blocking nature of them) and not to hit maxDirectMemorySize limit.\r\n\r\nThis PR abstracts allocation of intermediate result buffer pool in `IntermediateResultsPoolProvider`, which eagerly allocates\r\n - Zero buffers on broker and router nodes, if the default groupBy strategy = v2.\r\n - `druid.processing.numThreads`

- Avoid using the default system locale, use `Locale.ENGLISH` instead:\r\n   - In `String.format()`, replace with `StringUtils.format()` in the whole codebase: 90% changes of this PR.\r\n   - `String.toLowerCase()` and `toUpperCase()`, replace with `StringUtils.toLowerCase()` and `toUpperCase()` accordingly.\r\n   - `System.out.printf()`, in test code\r\n   - Misc\r\n\r\nThis is not just stylistic change, it may actually lead to errors if Druid-running servers have non-English locale, [`String.toLowerCase()` Javadoc gives a scary example](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#toLowerCase--).\r\n\r\n - Don't use `System.out`, `e.printStackTrace()` and similar in production code, replace with logging. Except for a few classes in `druid-services`, like `io.druid.cli.Main`.\r\n - Replace `new IOException(String.format(...))` with `new IOE(...)`, and similarly with `ISE`, `IAE` and `UOE` where possible.\r\n - A small fix: https://github.com/druid-io/druid/pull/4326#issuecomment-306568658\r\n\r\nThis PR doesn't enforce prohibition of using the default system locale and `System.out`, because I want to do that with this plugin: https://github.com/policeman-tools/forbidden-apis, and it also forbids using the default timezone, for what I want to create a separate PR.\r\n\r\nFixes #4335\r\n\r\nThis PR is a copy of #4392 which was accidentially closed by branch removal.","created_at":"2017-06-15T04:02:35Z","updated_at":"2018-07-06T15:37:32Z","closed_at":"2017-06-29T21:06:19Z","merged_at":"2017-06-29T21:06:19Z","merge_commit_sha":"9ae457f7ad1a4771bc5aacab3005d91d881b365e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":321808195,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMjE4MDgxOTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Improvement","name":"Improvement","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/23","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/milestone/23","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/23/labels","id":2338417,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMjMzODQxNw==","number":23,"title":"0.11.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":273,"state":"closed","created_at":"2017-02-21T17:48:27Z","updated_at":"2018-01-05T00:20:59Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2017-12-05T15:32:25Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/4409/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/4409/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/4409/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/statuses/a6502f249037d2f3010af11fbf9555a77a04bfa4","head":{"label":"metamx:noDefaultLocaleAndSystemPrint","ref":"noDefaultLocaleAndSystemPrint","sha":"a6502f249037d2f3010af11fbf9555a77a04bfa4","user":{"login":"metamx","id":299329,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjI5OTMyOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/299329?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx","html_url":"https://github.com/metamx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":28248872,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODI0ODg3Mg==","name":"druid","full_name":"metamx/druid","private":false,"owner":{"login":"metamx","id":299329,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjI5OTMyOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/299329?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx","html_url":"https://github.com/metamx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/metamx/druid","description":"RealÂ²time

expression filter expects a single argument, \"expression\", and matches rows where that expression is true.\r\n\r\nOne potentially interesting thing about the expression filter is that it treats multi-valued columns as if they were just null. I'm not sure of a better approach to this. Most existing filters are \"value filters\" that handle multi-valued columns by matching a row if _any_ value of a multi-value column matches the filter. But expressions are not \"value filters\". They match against the entire row, not just against values of a specific columns.\r\n\r\nOne possible solution is to treat multi-value columns as arrays when running them through the expression filter, but, the expression runtime doesn't have an array type or any functions for dealing with arrays.\r\n\r\nI think for now, treating them as nulls is fine, but a future patch should change the behavior to do something more useful.\r\n\r\nThe PR does not include documentation since expression-related features are generally not documented yet, including expression virtual columns and expression inputs to aggregators.

- Avoid using the default system locale, use `Locale.ENGLISH` instead:\r\n   - In `String.format()`, replace with `StringUtils.safeFormat()` in the whole codebase: 90% changes of this PR.\r\n   - `String.toLowerCase()` and `toUpperCase()`, replace with `StringUtils.toLowerCase()` and `toUpperCase()` accordingly.\r\n   - `System.out.printf()`, in test code\r\n   - Misc\r\n\r\nThis is not just stylistic change, it may actually lead to errors if Druid-running servers have non-English locale, [`String.toLowerCase()` Javadoc gives a scary example](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#toLowerCase--).\r\n\r\n - Don't use `System.out`, `e.printStackTrace()` and similar in production code, replace with logging. Except for a few classes in `druid-services`, like `io.druid.cli.Main`.\r\n - Replace `new IOException(String.format(...))` with `new IOE(...)`, and similarly with `ISE`, `IAE` and `UOE` where possible. \r\n\r\nThis PR doesn't enforce prohibition of using the default system locale and `System.out`, because I want to do that with this plugin: https://github.com/policeman-tools/forbidden-apis, and it also forbids using the default timezone, for what I want to create a separate

problem which I encountered while trying to use Spark 2.1 with Druid 0.10.1 is Guava incompatibility in DataSegmentPushers. I didn't understand how Guava 18+ appeared in classpath because both Druid and Spark depend on older version, but it was failing with `NoSuchMethodError` of `ByteStreams.newInputStreamSupplier()`. Either way, the solution is to get rid of Guava in DataSegmentPushers for creating descriptor file, because there is a standard JDK method for this since Java 7, and the Guava's method is deprecated.","created_at":"2017-06-11T18:20:36Z","updated_at":"2018-07-06T15:37:30Z","closed_at":"2017-06-12T16:58:34Z","merged_at":"2017-06-12T16:58:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"c121845102dde70545be65b4b01a9f2a27a2a76e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":606691557,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2MDY2OTE1NTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Compatibility","name":"Compatibility","color":"c5def5","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/19","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/milestone/19","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/19/labels","id":1571408,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMTU3MTQwOA==","number":19,"title":"0.10.1","description":"","creator":{"login":"fjy","id":428325,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODMyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/428325?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy","html_url":"https://github.com/fjy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":249,"state":"closed","created_at":"2016-02-08T22:01:01Z","updated_at":"2017-10-18T22:13:41Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2017-09-05T21:25:33Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/4391/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/4391/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/4391/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/statuses/3985a08a5a1b6af3442e854842243afaa14be4fb","head":{"label":"metamx:deprecated-guava-fix","ref":"deprecated-guava-fix","sha":"3985a08a5a1b6af3442e854842243afaa14be4fb","user":{"login":"metamx","id":299329,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjI5OTMyOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/299329?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx","html_url":"https://github.com/metamx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":28248872,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODI0ODg3Mg==","name":"druid","full_name":"metamx/druid","private":false,"owner":{"login":"metamx","id":299329,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjI5OTMyOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/299329?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx","html_url":"https://github.com/metamx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/metamx/druid","description":"RealÂ²time

is a follow-up to #4207, but taking a different approach. The line count is higher but that's mostly because this patch also adds important functionality (in particular, post-aggregation projections, and a lot of new functions) that the other patch didn't have.\r\n\r\nThe motivation is to make more kinds of queries possible. With the changes in this patch, these are all possible in both native queries and Druid SQL queries:\r\n\r\n- Grouping by functions of multiple columns (e.g. group by `concat(lastName, \", \", firstName)`)\r\n- Filtering on functions of multiple columns (e.g. filter where `x > y`)\r\n- Post-aggregation projections on dimensions (e.g. group by `mydim` but include `strlen(mydim)` as a post-aggregation)\r\n- Ordering by post-aggregation projections (e.g. group by `mydim` but order by `lower(mydim)`)\r\n\r\nMain changes:\r\n\r\n- Use expressions as a projection layer for anything that can't be\r\n  expressed using traditional Druid extractionFns. Sometimes they're\r\n  embedded directly (like \"expression\" filters, builtin aggregators,\r\n  or \"expression\" post-aggregators). Sometimes they're referenced\r\n  through virtual columns (like dimensionSpecs, which can't innately\r\n  reference functions of more than one column without the virtual\r\n  column layer).\r\n- Add many new functions and operators, taking advantage of the\r\n  expression capability (see the querying/sql.md doc).\r\n- Improve consistency of constant reduction and of casting by\r\n  using Druid expressions for this instead of Calcite's RexExecutor.","created_at":"2017-06-02T20:20:10Z","updated_at":"2018-07-06T15:37:28Z","closed_at":"2017-07-07T15:48:26Z","merged_at":"2017-07-07T15:48:26Z","merge_commit_sha":"16817e408d691e81ed77b528189cc9587d49a7b1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287687,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Feature","name":"Feature","color":"2ceefb","default":false,"description":null},{"id":592291319,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1OTIyOTEzMTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Design%20Review","name":"Design
