To acomplish this, the `describe()` method should be called after the `open()` method. For this reason I moved the line `LOG.info(writers.describe());` on `IndexingJob.java:124` to `IndexerOutputFormat.java:45`.

patch includes an update for solrj library from version 5.5.0 to 7.3.1. According to [SOLR-8903](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-8903), the lastest available version of this library doesn't include `DateUtil` class, so for formatting the dates I used `DateTimeFormatter.ISO_INSTANT.format(d.toInstant())` instead. In addition, the weight of a document is no longer supported by this library as an attribute of `SolrInputDocument` class and for that reason I include a new paramater: \"weight.field\", indicating the field's name where the document weight should be written. Also, Basic Authentication is now supported.\r\n\r\nOn the other side, I refactored the code, deleting some unused constants, unsed parameters and including others in index-writers.xml.\r\n\r\nThis PR was tested in Solr 6.3.0 and 7.3.1 in standalone and cloud mode. Basic Authentication was tested in these versions too.","created_at":"2018-06-21T03:43:01Z","updated_at":"2019-03-27T16:53:41Z","closed_at":"2018-06-21T14:50:24Z","merged_at":"2018-06-21T14:50:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"6d03b523ed9182b1eb9322d08f66fda89f78dacc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nutch/pulls/351/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nutch/pulls/351/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nutch/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nutch/issues/351/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nutch/statuses/1f6bfe25de44389941529a4170a17c3deed16ad2","head":{"label":"r0ann3l:NUTCH-2600","ref":"NUTCH-2600","sha":"1f6bfe25de44389941529a4170a17c3deed16ad2","user":{"login":"r0ann3l","id":16123086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTIzMDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16123086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/r0ann3l","html_url":"https://github.com/r0ann3l","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r0ann3l/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r0ann3l/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r0ann3l/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r0ann3l/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r0ann3l/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r0ann3l/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r0ann3l/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r0ann3l/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r0ann3l/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":72591850,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3MjU5MTg1MA==","name":"nutch","full_name":"r0ann3l/nutch","private":false,"owner":{"login":"r0ann3l","id":16123086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTIzMDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16123086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/r0ann3l","html_url":"https://github.com/r0ann3l","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r0ann3l/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r0ann3l/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r0ann3l/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r0ann3l/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r0ann3l/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r0ann3l/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r0ann3l/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r0ann3l/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/r0ann3l/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/r0ann3l/nutch","description":"Mirror
