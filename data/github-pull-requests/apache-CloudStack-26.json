Description\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to fix the \"blank domain UUID\" situation, in which the user may provide an empty string as the UUID to the createDomain API. This situation can cause misleading actions in the UI (user trying to delete the wrong domain), and it also makes it impossible to remove the domain that has an empty UUID.\r\n\r\nThe createDomain API is not testing for empty strings or strings filled with whitespaces; therefore, it is allowing users to create a domain with an invalid UUID. Unless the UUID is manually changed in the DB, it is impossible to work with (or to delete) it.\r\n\r\nThe proposed solution is to generate a random valid UUID when the given one is a blank; thus,  preventing the reported problem.\r\n\r\nBesides that, I decided to refactor a little bit the createDomain method, and added unit tests for its whole processing. Then, we are able to guarantee its workings.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [X] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n- New unit tests were created to test the behavior of the new methods and changed ones.\r\n- It was also tested in a local lab, by creating new domains with blank UUIDs (for example with whitespaces and empty strings) and checking if the created domains would have valid generated UUIDs.","created_at":"2022-01-06T15:13:32Z","updated_at":"2022-02-11T17:05:02Z","closed_at":"2022-02-11T17:05:02Z","merged_at":"2022-02-11T17:05:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"bcd0979a5a0d75ce9a3274f346786bcac78df01f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/5835/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/5835/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/5835/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/c470e75da06d3ef7d0de187c72939bee1bac1d99","head":{"label":"scclouds:fix-blank-domain-uuid","ref":"fix-blank-domain-uuid","sha":"c470e75da06d3ef7d0de187c72939bee1bac1d99","user":{"login":"scclouds","id":85898818,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg1ODk4ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85898818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds","html_url":"https://github.com/scclouds","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":377596111,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzc1OTYxMTE=","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"scclouds/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"scclouds","id":85898818,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg1ODk4ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85898818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds","html_url":"https://github.com/scclouds","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/scclouds/cloudstack","description":"Apache

addresses when registering templates & ISOs.\r\nTested and the whole CloudStack template registration works fine when using IPv6 addresses (both on management node & template repository).\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if there are any know issues that justify blocking IPv6 addresses.\r\n\r\nI've tested on a 4.16.0.0 environment, however, the PR's base branch is main.\r\nI can rebase it for `4.16.1.0` if that sounds good.\r\n\r\nFixes: #3047\r\n\r\n<!--- ********************************************************************************* -->\r\n<!--- NOTE: AUTOMATATION USES

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR allows listing elements that are in projects when in the Default view.\r\nNowadays, Admins cannot list in the UI many relevant data, unless entering in each of the projects, which can be humanly not feasible considering 10s or 100s of projects.\r\n\r\nFor example, one Admin cannot list all VMs, SSH keys, affinity groups, volumes, not even events that happen in a project in order to track all the events.\r\n\r\nThe UI tabs that are considered for this proposed PR are:\r\n1. 'vm',\r\n2. 'vmgroup',\r\n3. 'ssh',\r\n4. 'affinitygroup',\r\n5. 'volume',\r\n6. 'snapshot',\r\n7. 'vmsnapshot',\r\n8. 'guestnetwork',\r\n9. 'vpc',\r\n10. 'securitygroups',\r\n11. 'publicip',\r\n12. 'vpncustomergateway',\r\n13. 'template',\r\n14. 'iso',\r\n15. 'event'\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds

Managed volume copy was always returning first host that could see storage pools\r\n\r\n* Fix null value in logging for ScaleIOPrimaryDataStoreDriver due to if/else logic error\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Marcus Sorensen <mls@apple.com>\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes #5788 \r\n\r\n It shuffles the list of valid host candidates that are used for processing volume migrations.  \r\n\r\nIt also fixes a logic error in debug logging that caused 'null' to be printed. Originally concatenating a static string with potentially null value and then testing to see if the result is null, which would never be true.\r\n\r\nA more ideal solution might be to track the jobs on each host and attempt to balance the load according to how busy each host is.  This was investigated and there's currently no obvious way to look up job assignments to hosts via the DB, the Commands sent to Agents are kept live in memory via the AgentAttache.  The ideal solution would be a much larger feature to coordinate Command assignments across the management server cluster, and possibly need improved agent comms to provide live status of Command progress.\r\n\r\nI additionally spent some time looking into how to isolate and unit test `findUpAndEnabledHostWithAccessToStoragePools()`. Currently it would require mocking three Daos, the DataStoreProviderManager, a DataStoreProvider, and a DataStoreDriver.  It's possible to write a test for this, however I was concerned that the unit test would be coding implementation across three methods into the test. These mocked Daos exist up to three methods deep - if the implementation of any of these methods changes then the test needs to be rewritten to code in the new implementation.  I wasn't sure this was the right thing to do just to add a simple one-line shuffle but I'm happy to go that route if needed.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature

Description\r\n\r\nUsing the VMWare hypervisor, and with Veeam integration enabled, when a VM is assigned to a Backup Offering, ACS executes an operation to clone the Veeam job of that Backup Offering. However, instead of using the Backup Offering specific repository, currently ACS uses the first repository found on Veeam, which can cause problems for users who have more than one repository.\r\n\r\nThis PR intends to fix this behavior.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nIt was tested in a local laboratory, with 2 Veeam repositories:\r\n\r\n- I assigned two VMs to two Backup Offerings, one for each repository;\r\n- The two jobs were created in the same repository, and it should be one for each. This happened because ACS is using the first repository it finds;\r\n- With this changes, I repeated the test in the same environment;\r\n- Now the jobs are being cloned in the correctly repositories.","created_at":"2021-12-14T13:42:21Z","updated_at":"2022-01-07T05:42:58Z","closed_at":"2022-01-07T05:42:57Z","merged_at":"2022-01-07T05:42:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"e993a20e5a86827a288ee31870543f1acdf305a3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":3036072822,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMDM2MDcyODIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:backup","name":"component:backup","color":"30F036","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/21","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/milestone/21","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/21/labels","id":6943953,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNjk0Mzk1Mw==","number":21,"title":"4.17.0.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"nvazquez","id":5295080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyOTUwODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5295080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez","html_url":"https://github.com/nvazquez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":383,"state":"closed","created_at":"2021-07-14T02:05:05Z","updated_at":"2022-06-06T14:02:44Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2022-06-06T14:02:44Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/5774/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/5774/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/5774/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/1d35954974431ee88f3a491c0ae79e08a792f819","head":{"label":"scclouds:veeam-use-template-repository-in-clone-job","ref":"veeam-use-template-repository-in-clone-job","sha":"1d35954974431ee88f3a491c0ae79e08a792f819","user":{"login":"scclouds","id":85898818,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg1ODk4ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85898818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds","html_url":"https://github.com/scclouds","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":377596111,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzc1OTYxMTE=","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"scclouds/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"scclouds","id":85898818,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg1ODk4ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85898818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds","html_url":"https://github.com/scclouds","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/scclouds/cloudstack","description":"Apache

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes setting a length for domain id parameters that allow passing a list of UUIDs separated by a comma. Allowing to run the API command in use-cases where there are many domain admins.\r\n\r\nCurrently when calling API command with multiple domain ids (for example `updateServiceOffering`) it leads to the following API error:\r\n```\r\nError: (HTTP 431, error code 9999) Unable to execute API command updateserviceoffering due to invalid value.\r\nValue greater than max allowed length 255 for param: domainIds\"\r\n```\r\nI am targeting this implementation at 4.16.1.0 and considering it a bug due to the fact that we could not relly on the API to execute a few critical updates. \r\n\r\nAdmins end up either calling multiple times the API or (:warning: don't go this way) doing DB changes.\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\n<!--

Description\r\n\r\nWhen cluster reached capacity threshold log message is:\r\n`\"capacity threshold defined at each cluster/ at global value for capacity Type : 0\"`\r\nAdmins hardly remember the Capacity Type and it can take a while to look at which is the resource for the respective ID.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a log message pointing to the capacity name (e.g. Memory / CPU) as well as global settings parameter name and value to be looked at.\r\nAdditionally, this PR also proposes to change the log message from DEBUG to Warning, as it gives relevant information in case of exceptions, and might enforce production environments to have log level at debugging instead of info.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For

Description\r\n\r\nWhen a volume is copied to another storage pool, if the template does not exist in the destination storage pool yet, it should be copied. The API `migrateVirtualMachineWithVolume` already does it; however, when migrating the volume with `migrateVolume` (VM stopped), the template is not copied, which causes inconsistencies in the database and primary storage systems. The not existence of the template in the storage pool causes an NPE when using the API `migrateVirtualMachineWithVolume`.  \r\n\r\nThis PR intends to avoid this NPE.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nI tested it in a test lab.\r\n\r\n1. I created a VM;\r\n2. I stopped the VM;\r\n3. I created a new primary storage;\r\n4. With API `migrateVolume` I migrated the volume to the new primary storage;\r\n5. Before this changes, when I tried to migrate the volume to another primary storage that does not have the template yet, it threw a NPE.\r\n6. After this changes, when I tried to migrate the volume to another primary storage that does not have the template yet, the migration could be done.","created_at":"2021-12-08T17:43:15Z","updated_at":"2021-12-16T14:51:38Z","closed_at":"2021-12-16T14:51:38Z","merged_at":"2021-12-16T14:51:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"79d924f3eeeaa7d876c12faaa5aa7703d490e14f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/22","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/milestone/22","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/22/labels","id":7110066,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAJTq2M4AbH2y","number":22,"title":"4.16.1.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"rohityadavcloud","id":95203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud","html_url":"https://github.com/rohityadavcloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":257,"state":"closed","created_at":"2021-09-01T00:38:50Z","updated_at":"2022-03-04T10:54:40Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2022-03-04T10:54:40Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/5758/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/5758/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/5758/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/39c0b94ba274875d1cf0125f3c49ace678e03659","head":{"label":"scclouds:insert-correct-template-size-when-live-migrating-vm-with-volumes","ref":"insert-correct-template-size-when-live-migrating-vm-with-volumes","sha":"39c0b94ba274875d1cf0125f3c49ace678e03659","user":{"login":"scclouds","id":85898818,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg1ODk4ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85898818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds","html_url":"https://github.com/scclouds","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":377596111,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzc1OTYxMTE=","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"scclouds/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"scclouds","id":85898818,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg1ODk4ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85898818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds","html_url":"https://github.com/scclouds","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/scclouds/cloudstack","description":"Apache

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the issue that new ip is not working if old ip is used in lb/pf (or dnat).\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the issue\r\n(1) create isolated network, and vm\r\n(2) acquire 3 public ips, add firewall rules to allow port 22 (ssh)\r\n(3) create NAT to the vm on public ip 1, load balancer to vm port 22 (ssh) on public ip 2,  port forwarding rule to vm port 22 on public ip 3\r\n(4) verify the ssh connection to vm, all work\r\n(5) stop vm, and update vm nic ip, start vm\r\n(6) expected result: DNAT, LB, PF work, \r\nactual result without this PR : LB and PF do not work.\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR improves the volume file search on the datastore while computing the VM snapshot chain size in VMware. The file search is now performed in the VM directory on the datastore, instead of all the directories on the datastore (which is leading to incorrect VM snapshot chain size computation when VM id has 6 digits).\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case

Description\r\n\r\nCurrently shared networks and VPC private gateways can only be created from ROOT admin.\r\nThis PR contains the following enhancement\r\n\r\n# 1. Create shared network offering with specifyvlan=false\r\n* specifyvlan MUST be true for shared network offering for now\r\n* specifyvlan can be true or false with this PR.\r\n\r\n# 2. Create shared network by non-ROOT users\r\n## If specifyvlan=true in shared network offering\r\nvlan is required, it can be created/removed only by ROOT admin\r\n\r\n## if specifyvlan=false in shared network offering\r\n\r\nAll users can create shared network with an associated network (isolated networks), it will use the same vlan of associated network.\r\nIf associated network is not specified, cloudstack will allocate a vlan from zone guest vlan ranges to the shared network.\r\n\r\n* ROOT admin and Domain admins can create shared network for domain (acltype=domain) and account (acltype=account) \r\n* Normal users can create shared network for account (acltype=account) \r\n* Associated network MUST be an Isolated network\r\n* Associated network MUST be owned by same account (if acltype=account) or in the same domain (if acltype=domain)\r\n* Associated network MUST be on same physical network as the new shared network.\r\n\r\n# 3. Create VPC private gateway by non-ROOT users\r\n\r\nALL users can create VPC private gateway with an associated network. it will use the same vlan of associated network.\r\n\r\n* Associated network MUST be an Isolated network\r\n* Associated network MUST be owned by same account\r\n* Associated network MUST be on same physical network as the private gateway.\r\n* The private gateway will use the new system network offering : System-Private-Gateway-Network-Offering-Without-Vlan\r\n\r\nROOT admin can create VPC private gateway with a specified vlan. It can only be removed by root admin either.\r\nThe private gateway will use the new system network offering : System-Private-Gateway-Network-Offering\r\n\r\n# 4. List guest vlans in zone\r\n\r\nAn API is introduced to list all guest vlans: listGuestVlans . It is only available by root admin.\r\n\r\nGuest vlans can be listed by\r\n* id\r\n* zoneid\r\n* physical network id\r\n* vnet (vlan id)\r\n* allocatedonly (true/false)\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your

Description\r\nAdd a new parameter `unorderedfirstfitleastconsumed` for\r\n`vm.allocation.algorithm` which computes the suitable hosts list\r\nin parallel threads and does not care about priority\r\nbut still ensures that other criterias are met\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrently all vm allocation alogirhm computes the suitable host list\r\nsequentially and also the list for sutiable storage pools.\r\nIf we have more than 200 hosts and storage pools then these checks will\r\nbe done twice and takes really long time.\r\nIf we dont care about the priority but still want all other criterias to be\r\nmet then use the new allocation algorithm which computes the host list\r\nin parallel which is way faster.\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally

Description\r\n\r\nThe unit tests of class `HostMetricsResponse` will fail when they are executed on machines with `locale` other than `en_US`. This happens because locales can have distinct decimal separators, for instance, `.` in `en_US` and `,` in `pt_BR`.\r\n\r\nThis PR solves the mentioned problem by modifying the tests to use the decimal separator character according to the Locale set on the local machine (which is running the tests), instead of using a hardcoded decimal separator.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nI ran the unit tests of class `HostMetricsResponse` with locale `pt_BR` and `en_US`.
