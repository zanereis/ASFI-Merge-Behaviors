an issue with the Profinet auto-discovery that wouldn't work if I my wi-fi was disabled.\r\n\r\nAdded support for discovering S7-1200 and S7-1500 devices based on the Profinet auto-discovery mechanism, as every S7 device I had reacted to profinet auto-discovery requests and contained the vendor and device id. So I've duplicated the small fraction of the Profinet DCP protocol, that was needed to implment this and simply filter devices based on their device-id.\r\n\r\nCurrently I'm still missing some device

others.)","created_at":"2024-09-02T21:12:22Z","updated_at":"2024-09-05T14:14:22Z","closed_at":"2024-09-05T14:14:20Z","merged_at":"2024-09-05T14:14:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"b9a29d5556e744e1c64866bc899aeebacc4c206b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"glcj","id":15176267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTc2MjY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15176267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/glcj","html_url":"https://github.com/glcj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glcj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glcj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glcj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glcj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glcj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glcj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glcj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glcj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/glcj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/pulls/1743/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/pulls/1743/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/issues/1743/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/statuses/7b88ac71d22a9f91c9d2fee8af5a8a735ff3b37a","head":{"label":"apache:feature/s7-discovery","ref":"feature/s7-discovery","sha":"7b88ac71d22a9f91c9d2fee8af5a8a735ff3b37a","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":114859883,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTQ4NTk4ODM=","name":"plc4x","full_name":"apache/plc4x","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/plc4x","description":"PLC4X

releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>8.3.1</h2>\n<h1>pytest 8.3.1 (2024-07-20)</h1>\n<p>The 8.3.0 release failed to include the change notes and docs for the release. This patch release remedies this. There are no other changes.</p>\n<h2>8.3.0</h2>\n<h1>pytest 8.3.0 (2024-07-20)</h1>\n<h2>New features</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12231\">#12231</a>: Added [--xfail-tb]{.title-ref} flag, which turns on traceback output for XFAIL results.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the [--xfail-tb]{.title-ref} flag is not given, tracebacks for XFAIL results are NOT shown.</li>\n<li>The style of traceback for XFAIL is set with [--tb]{.title-ref}, and can be [auto|long|short|line|native|no]{.title-ref}.</li>\n<li>Note: Even if you have [--xfail-tb]{.title-ref} set, you won't see them if [--tb=no]{.title-ref}.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some history:</p>\n<p>With pytest 8.0, [-rx]{.title-ref} or [-ra]{.title-ref} would not only turn on summary reports for xfail, but also report the tracebacks for xfail results. This caused issues with some projects that utilize xfail, but don't want to see all of the xfail tracebacks.</p>\n<p>This change detaches xfail tracebacks from [-rx]{.title-ref}, and now we turn on xfail tracebacks with [--xfail-tb]{.title-ref}. With this, the default [-rx]{.title-ref}/ [-ra]{.title-ref} behavior is identical to pre-8.0 with respect to xfail tracebacks. While this is a behavior change, it brings default behavior back to pre-8.0.0 behavior, which ultimately was considered the better course of action.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12281\">#12281</a>: Added support for keyword matching in marker expressions.</p>\n<p>Now tests can be selected by marker keyword arguments.\nSupported values are <code>int</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;class&quot;}, (unescaped) <code>str</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;class&quot;}, <code>bool</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;class&quot;} &amp; <code>None</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;data&quot;}.</p>\n<p>See <code>marker examples &lt;marker_keyword_expression_example&gt;</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;ref&quot;} for more information.</p>\n<p>-- by <code>lovetheguitar</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;user&quot;}</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12567\">#12567</a>: Added <code>--no-fold-skipped</code> command line option.</p>\n<p>If this option is set, then skipped tests in short summary are no longer grouped\nby reason but all tests are printed individually with their nodeid in the same\nway as other statuses.</p>\n<p>-- by <code>pbrezina</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;user&quot;}</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Improvements in existing functionality</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12469\">#12469</a>: The console output now uses the &quot;third-party plugins&quot; terminology,\nreplacing the previously established but confusing and outdated\nreference to <code>setuptools &lt;setuptools:index&gt;</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;std:doc&quot;}\n-- by <code>webknjaz</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;user&quot;}.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12544\">#12544</a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12545\">#12545</a>: Python virtual environment detection was improved by\nchecking for a <code>pyvenv.cfg</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;file&quot;} file, ensuring reliable detection on\nvarious platforms -- by <code>zachsnickers</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;user&quot;}.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h1>Mypy Release Notes</h1>\n<h2>Next release</h2>\n<h2>Mypy 1.11</h2>\n<p>We’ve just uploaded mypy 1.11 to the Python Package Index (<a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/mypy/\">PyPI</a>). Mypy is a static type checker for Python. This release includes new features, performance improvements and bug fixes. You can install it as follows:</p>\n<pre><code>python3 -m pip install -U mypy\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can read the full documentation for this release on <a href=\"http://mypy.readthedocs.io\">Read the Docs</a>.</p>\n<h4>Support Python 3.12 Syntax for Generics (PEP 695)</h4>\n<p>Mypy now supports the new type parameter syntax introduced in Python 3.12 (<a href=\"https://peps.python.org/pep-0695/\">PEP 695</a>).\nThis feature is still experimental and must be enabled with the <code>--enable-incomplete-feature=NewGenericSyntax</code> flag, or with <code>enable_incomplete_feature = NewGenericSyntax</code> in the mypy configuration file.\nWe plan to enable this by default in the next mypy feature release.</p>\n<p>This example demonstrates the new syntax:</p>\n<pre lang=\"python\"><code># Generic function\ndef f[T](https://github.com/python/mypy/blob/master/x: T) -&gt; T: ...\n<p>reveal_type(f(1))  # Revealed type is 'int'</p>\n<h1>Generic class</h1>\n<p>class C[T]:\ndef <strong>init</strong>(self, x: T) -&gt; None:\nself.x = x</p>\n<p>c = C('a')\nreveal_type(c.x)  # Revealed type is 'str'</p>\n<h1>Type alias</h1>\n<p>type A[T] = C[list[T]]\n</code></pre></p>\n<p>This feature was contributed by Jukka Lehtosalo.</p>\n<h4>Support for <code>functools.partial</code></h4>\n<p>Mypy now type checks uses of <code>functools.partial</code>.

[pytest-asyncio](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-asyncio) from 0.23.7 to 0.23.8.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-asyncio/releases\">pytest-asyncio's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>pytest-asyncio 0.23.8</h2>\n<h1>0.23.8 (2024-07-17)</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixes a bug that caused duplicate markers in async tests <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-asyncio/issues/813\">#813</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Known issues</h2>\n<p>As of v0.23, pytest-asyncio attaches an asyncio event loop to each item of the test suite (i.e. session, packages, modules, classes, functions) and allows tests to be run in those loops when marked accordingly. Pytest-asyncio currently assumes that async fixture scope is correlated with the new event loop scope. This prevents fixtures from being evaluated independently from the event loop scope and breaks some existing test suites (see <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-asyncio/issues/706\">#706</a>). For example, a test suite may require all fixtures and tests to run in the same event loop, but have async fixtures that are set up and torn down for each module. If you're affected by this issue, please continue using the v0.21 release, until it is resolved.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-asyncio/commit/4be86a5174f864f6098872fc9fdf0a557a1b50f8\"><code>4be86a5</code></a> docs: Prepare release of v0.23.8.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-asyncio/commit/74b3a0a2057b6faaaf2dfc2d1de785abcf145bcb\"><code>74b3a0a</code></a> Build(deps): Bump exceptiongroup in /dependencies/default</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-asyncio/commit/b0009ca36ad66ec0bf40b2ad97edaa96fa39e510\"><code>b0009ca</code></a> [build] Declare support for Python 3.13.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-asyncio/commit/c747c7db7837d7cb7fef029af92092e20759e217\"><code>c747c7d</code></a> Build(deps): Bump coverage from 7.5.4 to 7.6.0 in /dependencies/default</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-asyncio/commit/5c40a1cf8b6f47f47596fcf1117420585517c627\"><code>5c40a1c</code></a> Build(deps): Bump hypothesis in /dependencies/default</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-asyncio/commit/b735e8a8ef3118109521c7b058596cf7decb03d0\"><code>b735e8a</code></a> build: Remove development dependency on Docker.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-asyncio/commit/91171b41c2bd6714955cd3d72e07bd9091f909e2\"><code>91171b4</code></a> ci: Test with CPython 3.13.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-asyncio/commit/d572138e097f493c07c84151649d191df5e09ee0\"><code>d572138</code></a> Build(deps): Bump hypothesis in /dependencies/default</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-asyncio/commit/a89e4d7a899d7587e1efa6cafe9e181b3e2a1d69\"><code>a89e4d7</code></a> Build(deps): Bump certifi in /dependencies/docs</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-asyncio/commit/b646cc18a222c8043433c38a42c07245fe9735ce\"><code>b646cc1</code></a> [fix] Fixed a bug that causes markers to be duplicated for async test functions.</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-asyncio/compare/v0.23.7...v0.23.8\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=pytest-asyncio&package-manager=pip&previous-version=0.23.7&new-version=0.23.8)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

Mypy is a static type checker for Python. This release includes new features, performance improvements and bug fixes. You can install it as follows:</p>\n<pre><code>python3 -m pip install -U mypy\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can read the full documentation for this release on <a href=\"http://mypy.readthedocs.io\">Read the Docs</a>.</p>\n<h4>Breaking Changes</h4>\n<p>Because the version of typeshed we use in mypy 1.9 doesn't support 3.7, neither does mypy 1.9.

statement coverage data with branch coverage data,\ncoverage.py used to fail with the message &quot;Can't combine arc data with line\ndata&quot; or its reverse, &quot;Can't combine line data with arc data.&quot;  These\nmessages used internal terminology, making it hard for people to understand\nthe problem.  They are now changed to mention &quot;branch coverage data&quot; and\n&quot;statement coverage data.&quot;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fixed a minor branch coverage problem with wildcard match/case cases using\nnames or guard clauses.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Started testing on 3.13 free-threading (nogil) builds of Python.

<code>InetAddress</code>-<code>String</code> conversion methods to preserve the IPv6 scope ID if present. The scope ID can be necessary for IPv6-capable devices with multiple network interfaces. However, preserving it can also lead to problems for callers that rely on the returned values <em>not</em> to include the scope ID:\n<ul>\n<li>Callers might compensate for the old behavior of the methods by appending the scope ID to a returned string themselves. If so, you can update your code to stop doing so at the same time as you upgrade Guava. Of, if your code might run against multiple versions of Guava, you can check whether Guava has included a scope ID before you add one yourself.</li>\n<li>Callers might pass the returned string to another system that does not understand scope IDs. If so, you can strip the scope ID off, whether by truncating the string form at a <code>%</code> character (leaving behind any trailing <code>]</code> character in the case of <code>forUriString</code>) or by replacing the returned <code>InetAddress</code> with a new instance constructed by calling <code>InetAddress.getByAddress(addr)</code>.</li>\n<li><code>java.net.InetAddress</code> validates any provided scope ID against the interfaces available on the machine. As a result, methods in <code>InetAddresses</code> may now fail if the scope ID fails validation.\n<ul>\n<li>Notable cases in which this may happen include:\n<ul>\n<li>if the code runs in an Android app without networking permission</li>\n<li>if code passes <code>InetAddress</code> instances or strings across devices</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>If this is not the behavior that you want, then you can strip off the scope ID from the input string before passing it to Guava, as discussed above.
