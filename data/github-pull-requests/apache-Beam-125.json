Unlike when using query or load jobs, BigQuery does not allow field addition or relaxation when using copy jobs to append data to an existing table.\r\n\r\nThe solution: Before starting the copy jobs to move data from temporary tables to the final destination table, run zero row load jobs against the destination table(s) using the temporary table schemas and user provided schema update options. These zero row load jobs will update (if needed) the schema of the destination table(s) to accept the data from the forthcoming copy jobs.\r\n\r\nIf no schema update options are configured, then no zero-row load jobs will be run--`UpdateDestinationSchema` and `WaitForSchemaModJobs` become no-ops.\r\n\r\nSummary of changes:\r\n* (This PR is stacked on top of #14112)\r\n* Trigger zero-row load jobs against destination tables after successfully loading data into temporary tables and before triggering copy jobs.\r\n* Update `BigQueryWrapper.perform_load_jobs` to allow triggering load jobs using either a list of source URIs or a single file like object (for this PR the file like object is an empty file, or zero-row CSV file).\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

adding the warning log about unrecognized states, I've seen that PENDING is not recognized. I mapped it to RUNNING since that is closest.\r\n\r\nTechnically, both adding and removing enums could be a compatibility issue. It is an unfortunate API design. The `State` enum is both too detailed (having states that are not very generic) but also not detailed enough (not allowing runners to have runner-specific details because it is an enum not a type parameter).\r\n\r\nSo my approach is to just put a band-aid on it and map states to their closest Beam state. Eventually, if we care, we might design a better API and deprecate this one.\r\n\r\nWe could also just document something like \"you have to have a `default` clause in your `switch` statements because we intend to add new enums\". Probably most users are not actually looking at all these possible values.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Added deepcopy copier implementation to Pipeline, AppliedPTransform,\r\n   PCollection and PTransform classes in Python SDK.\r\n2. Added a copy_pipeline util to switch between runner-api-roundtrip and\r\n   new deepcopy implementation based on whether the pipeline contains an\r\n   ExternalTransform. We'll gradually move away from the roundtrip\r\n   solution once the deepcopy solution is stable.\r\n3. Encapsulated the derivation tracking inside the copy_pipeline util.\r\n4. Early adopted the copy_pipeline util in pipeline_fragment and\r\n   pipeline_instrument. Further changes are still needed to support\r\n   ExternalTransforms with InteractiveRunner.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

seen a number of cases of \"job terminate in state UNRECOGNIZED but did not return a failure reason\". This will make it easy to notice what the unrecognized state is.\r\n\r\nThe risk is that it could create a lot of logging, but that should be limited to the polling in waiting for a job to finish. Whenever the Dataflow service creates a new state, it will be unrecognized by past SDKs, so this log line _will_ produce warnings for users of past SDKs in this scenario.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

They don't have to actually run it, but can go ahead and just always trigger. Then we can adjust the SDK or not, or wait until it is convenient, etc.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR prepares the vendored gRPC version upgrade from 1.26 to 1.35\r\n\r\n\r\n# Todo\r\n\r\n- See how this new version breaks compilation. It compiled how about tests?\r\n  - It compiled without changing code manually. Tests have passed except Java PostCommit that has been failing since Feb 27th. (-> sent a mail)\r\n  - With [this hack](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/14028/files#diff-c0dfa6bc7a8685217f70a860145fbdf416d449eaff052fa28352c5cec1a98c06R344), the pull request checks can run against the vendored gRPC 1.36.0 without publishing it to Maven Central.\r\n- Have a release manager to publish the vendored gRPC 1.36.0 (http://s.apache.org/beam-release-vendored-artifacts) with votes in dev@beam.apache.\r\n- Fix anything that fails with the vendored gRPC 1.36.0\r\n- Remove the directory for the old gRPC 1.26.0\r\n- Merge this PR.   \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

to see where it breaks when upgrading the vendored gRPC from 1.26 to 1.35.\r\n\r\nThe first step in https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/vendor/README.md:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Vendored Dependencies Release\r\n\r\nThe upgrading of the vendored dependencies should be performed in two steps:\r\n- Firstly, we need to perform a formal release of the vendored dependency.\r\n  The [release process](http://s.apache.org/beam-release-vendored-artifacts) of the vendored dependency\r\n  is separate from the release of Apache Beam.\r\n- When the release of the vendored dependency is out, we can migrate Apache Beam to use the newly released\r\n  vendored dependency.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThe command below is in the vendor/README.md, but it failed because `sdks/java/core` module cannot compile:\r\n```\r\n./gradlew -PvendoredDependenciesOnly -Ppublishing -PjavaLinkageArtifactIds=beam-vendor-grpc-1_26_0:0.1-SNAPSHOT :checkJavaLinkage\r\n```\r\n\r\nPrevious upgrade: https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/10578/files. (This seems that the PR was created **after** the new version of the vendored gRPC was released)\r\n\r\nNext step? https://s.apache.org/beam-release-vendored-artifacts ?\r\n\r\n**Please** add a meaningful description for your change here\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution! Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] [**Choose reviewer(s)**](https://beam.apache.org/contribute/#make-your-change) and mention them in a comment (`R: @username`).\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable. This will automatically link the pull request to the issue.\r\n - [ ] Update `CHANGES.md` with noteworthy changes.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual
