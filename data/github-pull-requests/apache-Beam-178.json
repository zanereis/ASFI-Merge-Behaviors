the `--temp_location` argument is parsed by the `GoogleCloudOptions` class. However, `--temp_location` or a similar argument may be useful for other runners as well.\r\n\r\nFor example, in the case of `DirectRunner`, `temp_location` may be the place where the runner stores its temporary files, if it ever supports out of process shuffles, combines, etc. In the case of `InteractiveRunner`, `temp_location` may be a good default location for the runner to store its cache files. In the case of the `WriteToFiles` transform, setting `temp_location` to `p.options.view_as(GoogleCloudOptions).temp_location` makes it appear as if `temp_location` has to be on GCS, which from my understanding, is not the case unless we are using the `DataflowRunner`?\r\n\r\nCC: @ivant @ananvay \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

google package maintainer,\r\nThe badges being added to the README in this PR will indicate your compatibility with other google packages. This addresses a set of user bugs which have happened when a user depends on two Cloud libraries (or runtimes that bundle libraries), say A and B, which both depend on library C. If the two libraries require different versions of C, the users can run into issues both when they pip install the libraries, and when they deploy their code. Our compatibility server checks that all libraries we make including this one are self and pairwise compatible as well as not having any deprecated dependencies. The two badges will mark the build for your project green when the latest version available on PyPI and github HEAD respectively meet all compatibility checks with itself and all other libraries. The badge target will link to a details page that elaborates on the current status. This should help you fix issues pre-release, to avoid user surprises.

StreamingDataflowWorker, when setting the workId for the logging MDC, currently the code attempts to decode a binary blob as utf8.  This will (generally) cause a decoding error, and the java UTF8 decoder uses a globally synchronized cache to handle generating these error results.  This can result in lock contention at high input rates.\r\n\r\nThis simply changes it to use protobuf's TextFormat to escape the bytes to a string, preserving human readability for keys with text in them.\r\n\r\n@lukecwik \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

is the same PR as #8743 but now applied to master\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWe run our Beam pipelines on Spark. Since upgrading from Beam 2.8.0 to 2.12.0 we experience a very high number of tasks per stage (in the millions). \r\n\r\nThe two relevant tickets that have introduced this behavior are:\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-5392\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-4783\r\n\r\nBoth are good changes that should remain, no question there.\r\n\r\nThe underlying issue is the HashPartioner that is used in the new GroupNonMergingWindowsFunctions#groupByKeyAndWindow method. The partitioner that used to be there would reduce the number of partitions to the parallelism that was set when the pipeline was started. The partitioner that is there now, does no longer do this.\r\n\r\nThe fix: I have added the partitioner as an extra argument, so we can supply the same partitioner throughout the pipeline. Because the partitioner can be null, I have added the fallback to be the one that it was before:\r\n```\r\n  private static <K, V> Partitioner getPartitioner(\r\n      Partitioner partitioner, JavaRDD<WindowedValue<KV<K, V>>> rdd) {\r\n    return partitioner == null ? new HashPartitioner(rdd.getNumPartitions()) : partitioner;\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

current approach to assume the classloader is a UrlClassloader is\r\nfundamentally flawed because:\r\n\r\n- it relies on an implementation detail (cast to UrlClassloader)\r\n- UrlClassloader does not exist in Java >= 9\r\n- UrlClassloader#getUrls() returns jars belonging to the JRE which leads to\r\n  errors like the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCaused by: java.lang.IllegalAccessError: class sun.reflect.GeneratedSerializationConstructorAccessor70 cannot access its superclass sun.reflect.SerializationConstructorAccessorImpl\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've tested the approach here with a remote Flink cluster and got rid of the\r\nabove error message.\r\n\r\nApart from fixing the issue present, the changes will also make the jar\r\ndetection code compatible with Java >= 9.\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests

Integration Tests for BigQuery file loads in streaming pipelines. This is subtask 1 of my GSoC project.\r\n\r\n1. The tests are similar to the tests for batch, with modifications to use TestStream. They make use of a kwarg `triggering_frequency` that will be used to control how often the load job for streaming pipelines needs to be triggered. \r\n\r\n2. These can be merged into a single test function with a `streaming` flag to be passed by a test to reuse code and make it neater. However, I avoided it as of now, because if at all any bug is introduced in the tests, during the refactor, we don't have the implementation to validate it. Once the implementation is done, the tests can be refactored.\r\n\r\n3. I haven't added the new tests to the Gradle file that contains the task `directRunnerIT` on which the tests that are supposed to run in streaming are run. Also because the new tests added are non-functional and only to illustrate the API changes needed.\r\n\r\n4. Merging this is optional as this would, at present, add no value to the test suite. \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR extends the portable python precommit test suite with a Python 3 scenario. \r\n- The PR adds portable wordcount test for Python 3 with Flink running in-process runner and SDK harness running in Docker container. \r\n- To run Python 2 and Python 3 test scenarios in parallel, we add the Py3 scenario to a new project project sdks/python/test-suites/portable/py35/build.gradle inline with the proposal discussed in https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/7c48200678c570c6e42d4933f8ea4f9324d82f7ae720b591a93ffcda@%3Cdev.beam.apache.org%3E. \r\n- To reduce the duplication of Gradle code between Python 2 and Python 3 suites, we move the common the definition of Portable Wordcount task to to Beam Module Plugin.  \r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

run our Beam pipelines on Spark. Since upgrading from Beam 2.8.0 to 2.12.0 we experience a very high number of tasks per stage (in the millions). \r\n\r\nThe two relevant tickets that have introduced this behavior are:\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-5392\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-4783\r\n\r\nBoth are good changes that should remain, no question there.\r\n\r\nThe underlying issue is the HashPartioner that is used in the new GroupNonMergingWindowsFunctions#groupByKeyAndWindow method. The partitioner that used to be there would reduce the number of partitions to the parallelism that was set when the pipeline was started. The partitioner that is there now, does no longer do this.\r\n\r\nThe fix: I have added the partitioner as an extra argument, so we can supply the same partitioner throughout the pipeline. Because the partitioner can be null, I have added the fallback to be the one that it was before:\r\n```\r\n  private static <K, V> Partitioner getPartitioner(\r\n      Partitioner partitioner, JavaRDD<WindowedValue<KV<K, V>>> rdd) {\r\n    return partitioner == null ? new HashPartitioner(rdd.getNumPartitions()) : partitioner;\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

was somewhat surprised to find that the unbounded thread growth I encountered when running portable validates runner tests on local Spark is was actually caused by [`GcsOptions.java`](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/39dab79b7bd56a47c0f2a02033ab4ca3bd4a67e2/sdks/java/extensions/google-cloud-platform-core/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/extensions/gcp/options/GcsOptions.java#L150-L156). I'm guessing this hasn't caused problems before because the SDK harness was always run in a separately managed process/container/whatever that terminated when work was complete.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, this was a pain to track down because thousands of threads used for any number of purposes were all uniformly named `pool-N-thread-M` (as they all used Java's [`defaultThreadFactory`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Executors.html#defaultThreadFactory--)). Going forward, I might look into naming Beam threads so it's easier to debug and analyze performance.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nR: @angoenka \r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

makes fastavro library a default Avro implementation in Beam Avro IO for Python 3 and this change will be released in 2.13.0. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/beam/pull/8652 instructs Dataflow runner to use fastavro as default implementation on Python 3 as well. This PR cherripicks this change. While not critical, it would be preferable to release both changes in the same release for consistent user experience, therefore I am proposing this cherry-pick for 2.13.0.\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests
