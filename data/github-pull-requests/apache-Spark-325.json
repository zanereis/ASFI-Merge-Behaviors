Basically, we should see if prediction is slower because of using a sparse matrix over a dense one. This can happen since sparse matrices do not use native BLAS operations when computing the margins.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe ultimate goal is for listeners to `onTaskEnd` to receive metrics when a task is killed intentionally, since the data is currently just thrown away. This is already done for ExceptionFailure, so this just copies the same approach.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe unit test in DAGSchedulerSuite that tests this for ExceptionFailure was modified to test the same thing for TaskKilled. I also re-tested all the unit tests modified by the [last change to TaskKilled](https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/8e558041aa0c41ba9fb2ce242daaf6d6ed4d85b7), and made sure they all still pass.\r\n\r\nFor integration tests, I ran a query that caused a speculative task retry on our deployment, and verified that the metrics showed up in our logging for that retry when it was killed.","created_at":"2017-03-25T00:20:54Z","updated_at":"2018-07-19T02:52:08Z","closed_at":"2018-07-19T02:52:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"37db5f5eff592a932b699ab529d312d62a168db5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17422/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17422/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17422/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/25ffbf49b2779d4fa795d754ee20fbe3542dd57d","head":{"label":"noodle-fb:task-killed-metrics","ref":"task-killed-metrics","sha":"25ffbf49b2779d4fa795d754ee20fbe3542dd57d","user":{"login":"noodle-fb","id":23197284,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMTk3Mjg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23197284?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/noodle-fb","html_url":"https://github.com/noodle-fb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noodle-fb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noodle-fb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noodle-fb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noodle-fb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noodle-fb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noodle-fb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noodle-fb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noodle-fb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noodle-fb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":86112876,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4NjExMjg3Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"noodle-fb/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"noodle-fb","id":23197284,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMTk3Mjg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23197284?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/noodle-fb","html_url":"https://github.com/noodle-fb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noodle-fb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noodle-fb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noodle-fb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noodle-fb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noodle-fb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noodle-fb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noodle-fb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noodle-fb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noodle-fb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/noodle-fb/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch adds the DataFrames API to the multivariate summarizer (mean, variance, etc.). In addition to all the features of `MultivariateOnlineSummarizer`, it also allows the user to select a subset of the metrics. This should resolve some performance issues related to computing unrequested metrics.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, it uses the BLAS API to the extent possible, so that the given code should be efficient for the dense case.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis patch includes most of the tests of the RDD-based. It compares results against the existing `MultivariateOnlineSummarizer` as well as adding more tests.\r\n\r\nThis patch also includes some documentation for some low-level constructs such as `TypedImperativeAggregate`.\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n\r\nI have not run tests against the existing implementation. However, this patch uses the recommended low-level SQL APIs, so it should be interesting to compare both implementation in that respect.\r\n\r\nThanks to @hvanhovell and Cheng Liang for suggestions on SparkSQL.","created_at":"2017-03-24T23:25:16Z","updated_at":"2017-08-01T22:03:20Z","closed_at":"2017-08-01T22:03:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0a170b8c8f0714c8edaab8d61c915912331d5e2e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17419/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17419/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17419/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a569dac8998d63adbc9adba1f2eb2f42967533e7","head":{"label":"thunterdb:19634","ref":"19634","sha":"a569dac8998d63adbc9adba1f2eb2f42967533e7","user":{"login":"thunterdb","id":7594753,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1OTQ3NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7594753?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thunterdb","html_url":"https://github.com/thunterdb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thunterdb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thunterdb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thunterdb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thunterdb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thunterdb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thunterdb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thunterdb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thunterdb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thunterdb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21404403,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQwNDQwMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"thunterdb/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"thunterdb","id":7594753,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1OTQ3NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7594753?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thunterdb","html_url":"https://github.com/thunterdb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thunterdb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thunterdb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thunterdb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thunterdb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thunterdb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thunterdb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thunterdb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thunterdb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thunterdb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/thunterdb/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn SQL queries, we also see predicate expressions involving two columns such as \"column-1 (op) column-2\" where column-1 and column-2 belong to same table. Note that, if column-1 and column-2 belong to different tables, then it is a join operator's work, NOT a filter operator's work.  \r\n\r\nThis PR estimates filter selectivity on two columns of same table.  For example, multiple tpc-h queries have this predicate \"WHERE l_commitdate < l_receiptdate\"\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nWe added 6 new test cases to test various logical

the shuffle server's metrics with the Hadoop Node Manager's\r\nDefaultMetricsSystem.\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nExpose the shuffle service metrics not only on the ExternalShuffleService as done in SPARK-16405, but also in the YarnShuffleService.  Because the YARN Node Manager's metrics system is the Hadoop-internal one and not the Dropwizard Metrics system that Spark uses, this requires a conversion from DW metrics to Hadoop metrics.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual deploy of new yarn-shuffle jar into a Node Manager and verifying that the metrics appear in the Node Manager-standard location.  This is JMX with an query endpoint at `/jmx`.\r\n\r\nResulting metrics look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[user@host ~]$ curl -sk -XGET https://`hostname -f`:8042/jmx | jq . | grep 'shuffleservice' -B 1 -A

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe current master might wrongly add shuffle operations when projects and aggregates in physical plans have  aliases in output expressions. A concrete example is as follows;\r\n```\r\nscala> :paste\r\nsql(\"SET spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold=-1\")\r\nspark.range(10).selectExpr(\"id AS key\", \"0\").repartition($\"key\").createOrReplaceTempView(\"df1\")\r\nspark.range(10).selectExpr(\"id AS key\", \"0\").repartition($\"key\").createOrReplaceTempView(\"df2\")\r\nsql(\"\"\"\r\n  SELECT * FROM\r\n    (SELECT key AS k from df1) t1\r\n  INNER JOIN\r\n    (SELECT key AS k from df2) t2\r\n  ON t1.k = t2.k\r\n\"\"\").explain\r\n\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\n*SortMergeJoin [k#56L], [k#57L], Inner\r\n:- *Sort [k#56L ASC NULLS FIRST], false, 0\r\n:  +- Exchange hashpartitioning(k#56L, 200)     // <--- Unnecessary ShuffleExchange\r\n:     +- *Project [key#39L AS k#56L]\r\n:        +- Exchange hashpartitioning(key#39L, 200)\r\n:           +- *Project [id#36L AS key#39L]\r\n:              +- *Range (0, 10, step=1, splits=Some(4))\r\n+- *Sort [k#57L ASC NULLS FIRST], false, 0\r\n   +- ReusedExchange [k#57L], Exchange hashpartitioning(k#56L, 200)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the query, the second `Exchange` is not necessary. The root cause is that the planner wrongly regards `key` and `k` as different attributes because they have different `exprId`. Then, it fails distribution requirement checks in `EnsureRequirements`. This pr proposes to handle these aliases in `EnsureRequirements` so as to check if the operators satisfy their output distribution requirements.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded tests in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nPreviously when we construct deserializer expression for array type, we will first cast the corresponding field to expected array type and then apply `MapObjects`.\r\n\r\nHowever, by doing that, we lose the opportunity to do by-name resolution for struct type inside array type. In this PR, I introduce a `UnresolvedMapObjects` to hold the lambda function and the input array expression. Then during analysis, after the input array expression is resolved, we get the actual array element type and apply by-name resolution. Then we don't need to add `Cast` for array type when constructing the deserializer expression, as the element type is determined later at analyzer.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nnew

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe explain output of `DataSourceScanExec` can contain sensitive information (like Amazon keys). Such information should not end up in logs, or be exposed to non privileged users.\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses this by adding a redaction facility for the `DataSourceScanExec.treeString`. A user can enable this by setting a regex in the `spark.redaction.string.regex` configuration.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded a unit test to check the output of DataSourceScanExec.

Problem Description\r\n\r\nReported by Silvio Fiorito\r\n\r\nI've got a Kafka topic which I'm querying, running a windowed aggregation, with a 30 second watermark, 10 second trigger, writing out to Parquet with append output mode.\r\n\r\nEvery 10 second trigger generates a file, regardless of whether there was any data for that trigger, or whether any records were actually finalized by the watermark.\r\n\r\nIs this expected behavior or should it not write out these empty files?\r\n\r\n```\r\nval df = spark.readStream.format(\"kafka\")....\r\n\r\nval query = df\r\n  .withWatermark(\"timestamp\", \"30 seconds\")\r\n  .groupBy(window($\"timestamp\", \"10 seconds\"))\r\n  .count()\r\n  .select(date_format($\"window.start\", \"HH:mm:ss\").as(\"time\"), $\"count\")\r\n\r\nquery\r\n  .writeStream\r\n  .format(\"parquet\")\r\n  .option(\"checkpointLocation\", aggChk)\r\n  .trigger(ProcessingTime(\"10 seconds\"))\r\n  .outputMode(\"append\")\r\n  .start(aggPath)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs the query executes, do a file listing on \"aggPath\" and you'll see 339 byte files at a minimum until we arrive at the first watermark and the initial batch is finalized. Even after that though, as there are empty batches it'll keep generating empty files every trigger.\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCheck the partition is empty or not, and skip empty partition to avoid output empty file.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nJenkins\r\n","created_at":"2017-03-23T08:22:16Z","updated_at":"2017-07-18T01:19:53Z","closed_at":"2017-06-20T03:13:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1b643d1f228cf00a979cdabd01bce597f41b7511","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17395/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17395/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17395/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/42da5af31952192e59fe3a09376246f39fe5251d","head":{"label":"uncleGen:SPARK-20065","ref":"SPARK-20065","sha":"42da5af31952192e59fe3a09376246f39fe5251d","user":{"login":"uncleGen","id":7402327,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MDIzMjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7402327?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uncleGen","html_url":"https://github.com/uncleGen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uncleGen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uncleGen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uncleGen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uncleGen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uncleGen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uncleGen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uncleGen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uncleGen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uncleGen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":23988410,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzk4ODQxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"uncleGen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"uncleGen","id":7402327,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MDIzMjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7402327?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uncleGen","html_url":"https://github.com/uncleGen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uncleGen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uncleGen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uncleGen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uncleGen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uncleGen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uncleGen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uncleGen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uncleGen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uncleGen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/uncleGen/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is to unify and clean up the outputs of `DESC EXTENDED/FORMATTED` and `SHOW TABLE EXTENDED` by moving the logics into the Catalog interface. The output formats are improved. We also add the missing attributes. It impacts the DDL commands like `SHOW TABLE EXTENDED`, `DESC EXTENDED` and `DESC FORMATTED`.\r\n\r\nIn addition, by following what we did in Dataset API `printSchema`, we can use `treeString` to show the schema in the more readable way. \r\n\r\nBelow is the current way:\r\n```\r\nSchema: STRUCT<`a`: STRING (nullable = true), `b`: INT (nullable = true), `c`: STRING (nullable = true), `d`: STRING (nullable = true)>\r\n```\r\nAfter the change, it should look like\r\n```\r\nSchema: root\r\n |-- a: string (nullable = true)\r\n |-- b: integer (nullable = true)\r\n |-- c: string (nullable = true)\r\n |-- d: string (nullable = true)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n`describe.sql` and `show-tables.sql`","created_at":"2017-03-23T05:40:03Z","updated_at":"2017-06-05T16:43:54Z","closed_at":"2017-04-04T06:32:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f5c2c464cb2859d387261caabccd805388e4d223","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17394/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17394/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17394/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/862a4d7a61e48ff7b0e1d52ea0416bc57a4d6a33","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:descFollowUp","ref":"descFollowUp","sha":"862a4d7a61e48ff7b0e1d52ea0416bc57a4d6a33","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-17204)\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of bugs in the `BlockManager` with respect to support for replicated off-heap storage. First, the locally-stored off-heap byte buffer is disposed of when it is replicated. It should not be. Second, the replica byte buffers are stored as heap byte buffers instead of direct byte buffers even when the storage level memory mode is off-heap. This PR addresses both of these problems.\r\n\r\n`BlockManagerReplicationSuite` was enhanced to fill in the coverage gaps. It now fails if either of the bugs in this PR exist.","created_at":"2017-03-22T17:21:49Z","updated_at":"2017-03-24T20:52:27Z","closed_at":"2017-03-24T20:42:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4071f5a5783bea79e4ceb37b3e07b140e59fa273","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17390/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17390/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17390/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ec1a8a2384fbf082ab13c4698dcb580e256b7202","head":{"label":"VideoAmp:spark-17204-replicated_off_heap_storage-2.0_backport","ref":"spark-17204-replicated_off_heap_storage-2.0_backport","sha":"ec1a8a2384fbf082ab13c4698dcb580e256b7202","user":{"login":"VideoAmp","id":7621972,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjc2MjE5NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7621972?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp","html_url":"https://github.com/VideoAmp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":49447912,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0OTQ0NzkxMg==","name":"spark-public","full_name":"VideoAmp/spark-public","private":false,"owner":{"login":"VideoAmp","id":7621972,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjc2MjE5NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7621972?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp","html_url":"https://github.com/VideoAmp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VideoAmp/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/VideoAmp/spark-public","description":"Mirror

So here changing to use child classloader.\r\n\r\nAlso putting added jars and main jar into classpath of submitted application in yarn cluster mode, otherwise HBase jars specified with `--jars` will never be honored in cluster mode, and fetching tokens in client side will always be failed.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit test and local

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n### Brief design\r\n#### Introductions\r\nThe basic issue for Standalone mode to visit kerberos secured HDFS or other kerberized Services is how to gather the delegated tokens on the driver side and deliver them to the executor side.\r\nWhen we run Spark on Yarn, we set the tokens to the container launch context to deliver them automatically and for long-term running issue caused by token expiration, we have it fixed with SPARK-14743 by writing the tokens to HDFS and updating the credential file and renewing them over and over.\r\nWhen run Spark On Standalone, we currently have no implementations like Yarn to get and deliver those tokens.\r\n#### Implementations\r\nFirstly, we simply move the implementation of SPARK-14743 which is only for yarn to core module. And we use it to gather the credentials we need, and also we use it to update and renew with credential files on HDFS.\r\nSecondly, credential files on secured HDFS are reachable for executors before they get the tokens. Here we add a sequence configuration `spark.security.credential.entities` which is used by the driver to put `token.encodeToUrlString()` before launching the executors, and used by the executors to fetch the credential as a string sequence during fetching the driver side spark properties, and then decode them to tokens. Before setting up the `CoarseGrainedExecutorBackend` we set the credentials to current executor side ugi.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n unit tests\r\n manual tests on kerberized metastore service and hdfs\r\n","created_at":"2017-03-22T13:23:04Z","updated_at":"2017-09-13T02:53:37Z","closed_at":"2017-09-13T02:53:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"34ba187ba39e4e11b9a0366a4039d6c1de96281b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17387/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17387/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17387/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/fdfa7e6b6f8173fbc74d57fcccf4f6c6ad3a4a3f","head":{"label":"yaooqinn:proxy-on-non-yarn","ref":"proxy-on-non-yarn","sha":"fdfa7e6b6f8173fbc74d57fcccf4f6c6ad3a4a3f","user":{"login":"yaooqinn","id":8326978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjY5Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8326978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn","html_url":"https://github.com/yaooqinn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"facfd608865c385c0dabfe09cffe5874532a9cdf","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR improves performance of operations with `sqlContext.read.parquet()` by changing Java code generated by Catalyst. This PR is inspired by [the blog article](https://databricks.com/blog/2017/02/16/processing-trillion-rows-per-second-single-machine-can-nested-loop-joins-fast.html) and [this stackoverflow entry](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/40629435/fast-parquet-row-count-in-spark).\r\n\r\nThis PR changes generated code in the following two points.\r\n1. Replace a while-loop with long instance variables a for-loop with int local variables\r\n2. Suppress generation of `shouldStop()` method if this method is unnecessary (e.g. `append()` is not generated).\r\n\r\nThese points facilitates compiler optimizations in a JIT compiler by feeding the simplified Java code into the JIT compiler. The performance of `sqlContext.read.parquet().count` is improved by 1.09x.\r\n\r\nBenchmark program:\r\n```java\r\nval dir = \"/dev/shm/parquet\"\r\nval N = 1000 * 1000 * 40\r\nval iters = 20\r\nval benchmark = new Benchmark(\"Parquet\", N * iters, minNumIters = 5, warmupTime = 30.seconds)\r\nsparkSession.range(n).write.mode(\"overwrite\").parquet(dir)\r\n\r\nbenchmark.addCase(\"count\") { i: Int =>\r\n  var n = 0\r\n  var len = 0L\r\n  while (n < iters) {\r\n    len += sparkSession.read.parquet(dir).count\r\n    n += 1\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nbenchmark.run\r\n```\r\n\r\nPerformance result without this PR\r\n```\r\nOpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM 1.8.0_121-8u121-b13-0ubuntu1.16.04.2-b13 on Linux 4.4.0-47-generic\r\nIntel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2667 v3 @ 3.20GHz\r\nParquet:                                 Best/Avg Time(ms)    Rate(M/s)   Per Row(ns)   Relative\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nw/o this PR                                   1152 / 1211        694.7           1.4       1.0X\r\n```\r\n\r\nPerformance result with this PR\r\n```\r\nOpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM 1.8.0_121-8u121-b13-0ubuntu1.16.04.2-b13 on Linux 4.4.0-47-generic\r\nIntel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2667 v3 @ 3.20GHz\r\nParquet:                                 Best/Avg Time(ms)    Rate(M/s)   Per Row(ns)   Relative\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nwith this PR                                  1053 / 1121        760.0           1.3       1.0X\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is a comparison between generated code w/o and with this PR.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nA Bean serializer in `ExpressionEncoder`  could change values when Beans having NULL. A concrete example is as follows;\r\n```\r\nscala> :paste\r\nclass Outer extends Serializable {\r\n  private var cls: Inner = _\r\n  def setCls(c: Inner): Unit = cls = c\r\n  def getCls(): Inner = cls\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass Inner extends Serializable {\r\n  private var str: String = _\r\n  def setStr(s: String): Unit = str = str\r\n  def getStr(): String = str\r\n}\r\n\r\nscala> Seq(\"\"\"{\"cls\":null}\"\"\", \"\"\"{\"cls\": {\"str\":null}}\"\"\").toDF().write.text(\"data\")\r\nscala> val encoder = Encoders.bean(classOf[Outer])\r\nscala> val schema = encoder.schema\r\nscala> val df = spark.read.schema(schema).json(\"data\").as[Outer](encoder)\r\nscala> df.show\r\n+------+\r\n|   cls|\r\n+------+\r\n|[null]|\r\n|  null|\r\n+------+\r\n\r\nscala> df.map(x => x)(encoder).show()\r\n+------+\r\n|   cls|\r\n+------+\r\n|[null]|\r\n|[null]|     // <-- Value changed\r\n+------+\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is because the Bean serializer does not have the NULL-check expressions that the serializer of Scala's product types has. Actually, this value change does not happen in Scala's product types; \r\n\r\n```\r\nscala> :paste\r\ncase class Outer(cls: Inner)\r\ncase class Inner(str: String)\r\n\r\nscala> val encoder = Encoders.product[Outer]\r\nscala> val schema = encoder.schema\r\nscala> val df = spark.read.schema(schema).json(\"data\").as[Outer](encoder)\r\nscala> df.show\r\n+------+\r\n|   cls|\r\n+------+\r\n|[null]|\r\n|  null|\r\n+------+\r\n\r\nscala> df.map(x => x)(encoder).show()\r\n+------+\r\n|   cls|\r\n+------+\r\n|[null]|\r\n|  null|\r\n+------+\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis pr added the NULL-check expressions in Bean serializer along with the serializer of Scala's product types.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded tests in `JavaDatasetSuite`.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-03-21T08:15:42Z","updated_at":"2017-07-05T11:50:56Z","closed_at":"2017-03-23T10:55:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"97818b63cb29e4fdd3bf2d86577f873c47d26676","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17372/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17372/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17372/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/cb7cccc94562fc120e49f4c56aed4936a9a87331","head":{"label":"maropu:SPARK-19980-BACKPORT2.1","ref":"SPARK-19980-BACKPORT2.1","sha":"cb7cccc94562fc120e49f4c56aed4936a9a87331","user":{"login":"maropu","id":692303,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MjMwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/692303?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu","html_url":"https://github.com/maropu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":27115199,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzExNTE5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"maropu/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"maropu","id":692303,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MjMwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/692303?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu","html_url":"https://github.com/maropu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/maropu/spark","description":"Mirror

add the watermark metadata into time column, but in `groupBy(\r\nwindow(words.timestamp, \"30 seconds\", \"30 seconds\"), words.word\r\n)`, the `words.timestamp` miss the metadata. At last, it failed to pass the check:~~\r\n\r\nuse @viirya 's more clear explanation:\r\n\r\nFor now, after withWatermark, we only update the metadata for the column of event time. The expression id is the same. So once we use the column before adding watermark words.timestamp as grouping expression, it binds to the old attribute before watermarking.\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (watermarkAttributes.isEmpty) {\r\n

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the kerberized hadoop cluster, when Spark creates tables, the owner of tables are filled with PRINCIPAL strings instead of USER names. This is inconsistent with Hive and causes problems when using [ROLE](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/SQL+Standard+Based+Hive+Authorization) in Hive. We had better to fix this. For Apache Spark 1.6, it happens only with `CREATE TABLE ... AS SELECT` (CTAS) statement.\r\n\r\n**BEFORE**\r\n```scala\r\nscala> sql(\"create table t_ctas as select 1\").show\r\nscala> sql(\"desc formatted t_ctas\").show(false)\r\n...\r\n|Owner:                      |spark@EXAMPLE.COM                                         |       |\r\n```\r\n\r\n**AFTER**\r\n```scala\r\nscala> sql(\"create table t_ctas as select 1\").show\r\nscala> sql(\"desc formatted

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nhave the`FileFormatWriter.ExecuteWriteTask.releaseResources()` implementations  set `currentWriter=null` in a finally clause. This guarantees that if the first call to `currentWriter()` throws an exception, the second releaseResources() call made during the task cancel process will not trigger a second attempt to close the stream. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTricky. I've been fixing the underlying cause when I saw the problem [HADOOP-14204](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-14204), but SPARK-10109 shows I'm not the first to have seen this. I can't replicate it locally any more, my code no longer being broken.\r\n\r\ncode review, however, should be

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the kerberized hadoop cluster, when Spark creates tables, the owner of tables are filled with PRINCIPAL strings instead of USER names. This is inconsistent with Hive and causes problems when using [ROLE](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/SQL+Standard+Based+Hive+Authorization) in Hive. We had better to fix this.\r\n\r\n**BEFORE**\r\n```scala\r\nscala> sql(\"create table t(a int)\").show\r\nscala> sql(\"desc formatted t\").show(false)\r\n...\r\n|Owner:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is the implementation of `ngrams` aggregate expression which is also implemented by Hive. It takes use of n-gram concept in natural language processing to understand texts.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Spark doesn't support using Hive UDAF GenericUDAFnGrams, which is actually a feature missing.\r\n\r\nAn n-gram is a contiguous subsequence of n item(s) drawn from a given sequence. This expression finds the k most frequent n-grams from one or more sequences. \r\n\r\nThis expression has the pattern of : ngrams(children: Array[Array[String]](or Array[String]), n: Int, k: Int, accuracy: Int), it can be used in conjuction with `sentences` to split the column of String to Array. Among the parameters: \r\nChildren indicates the 'given sequence' we collect n-grams from;\r\nN indicates n-gram's element number, size 1 is referred to as a \"unigram\", size 2 is a \"bigram\", size 3 is a \"trigram\"... \r\nK indicates top k;\r\nAccuracy is related to the memory used for frequency estimation, more memory will give more accurate frequency counts.\r\n\r\nA simple example: \r\n`SELECT ngrams(array(\"abc\", \"abc\", \"bcd\", \"abc\", \"bcd\"), 2, 4);` will get\r\n`[{[\"abc\",\"bcd\"]:2.0}, \r\n{[\"abc\",\"abc\"]:1.0}, \r\n{[\"bcd\",\"abc\"]:1.0}]`. Because there are four 2-grams for the input which are `[\"abc\", \"abc\"], [\"abc\", \"bcd\"], [\"bcd\", \"abc\"], [\"abc\", \"bcd\"]`, and `[\"abc\", \"bcd\"]` occurs 2 times, the other two 2-grams occurs 1 time each, while `[\"abc\",\"abc\"]` is alphabetically before `[\"bcd\",\"abc\"]`, so the answer is like that.\r\n\r\nAn interesting example for presidential candidates' speech analysis:\r\nI watched the US presidential election a few months ago, and wanted to get candidates' viewpoints and the phrases they'd like to use. How can I easily analyze the text without too much programming?\r\n\r\nI did a simple test using this expression:\r\n* Download the final debate transcript \r\n* Seperate different candidates' words to different files, translate punctuations to space\r\n* load 2 files each as a single string to different tables in Spark SQL\r\n* Execute `SELECT ngrams(sentences(lower(text)), 4, 40) from debate_trump(/clinton)`\r\n\r\nIf I ignored the word sequences like (we, are, going, to) which is said 27 times by Trump and 18 times by Clinton, the phrases they said a lot during the debate will be:\r\n\r\nFor Trump, (millions, of, people, that) for 4 times, (iran, is, taking, over) for 3 times, (putin, has, outsmarted, her) for 3 times, (she, wants, open, borders) for 3 times, (a, country, of, laws) for 2 times\r\n\r\nFor Clinton, (30, years, of, experience) for 2 times, (clear, to, the, russians) for 2 times, (grow, the, economy, to) for 2 times, (have, met, with, women) for 2 times.\r\n\r\nAnother example for movie reviews analysis:\r\nIf you have a column with movie or product reviews from users expressed as natural language strings. You want to find the top 10 most frequent word pairs. Let's do a simple test first, executing `SELECT ngrams(sentences(\"I hated this movie. I hated watching it and this movie made me unhappy.\"), 2, 4)` will get `[{[\"I\", \"hated\"]:2.0}, {[\"this\", \"movie\"]:2},{[\"hated\", \"this\"]:1},{ngram: [\"hated\", \"watching\"]:1}]`. And that result tells you people have a negative evaluation on that movie.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests are in `NGramsQuerySuite`

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn a bare metal system with No DNS setup, spark may be configured with SPARK_LOCAL* for IP and host properties.\r\nDuring a driver failover, in cluster deployment mode. SPARK_LOCAL* should be ignored while restarting on another node and should be picked up from target system's local environment.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nDistributed deployment against a spark standalone cluster of  6 Workers. Tested by killing JVM's running driver and verified the restarted JVMs have right configurations on them.","created_at":"2017-03-20T05:52:21Z","updated_at":"2017-10-10T12:51:39Z","closed_at":"2017-10-10T12:51:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"32cec142aa53ea81344b79db3421f8c397771863","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17357/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17357/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17357/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b188cc9a9e290683210d3c4a6841d37ca00b112f","head":{"label":"ScrapCodes:driver-failover-fix","ref":"driver-failover-fix","sha":"b188cc9a9e290683210d3c4a6841d37ca00b112f","user":{"login":"ScrapCodes","id":992952,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5Mjk1Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/992952?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes","html_url":"https://github.com/ScrapCodes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17210717,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIxMDcxNw==","name":"spark","full_name":"ScrapCodes/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ScrapCodes","id":992952,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5Mjk1Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/992952?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes","html_url":"https://github.com/ScrapCodes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ScrapCodes/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSessionCatalog API setCurrentDatabase does not set the current database of the underlying ExternalCatalog. Thus, weird errors could come in the test suites after we call reset. We need to fix it.\r\n\r\nSo far, have not found the direct impact in the other code paths because we expect all the SessionCatalog APIs should always use the current database value we managed, unless some of code paths skip it. Thus, we fix it in the test-only function reset().\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nMultiple test case failures are observed in mvn and add a test case in SessionCatalogSuite.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nA Bean serializer in `ExpressionEncoder`  could change values when Beans having NULL. A concrete example is as follows;\r\n```\r\nscala> :paste\r\nclass Outer extends Serializable {\r\n  private var cls: Inner = _\r\n  def setCls(c: Inner): Unit = cls = c\r\n  def getCls(): Inner = cls\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass Inner extends Serializable {\r\n  private var str: String = _\r\n  def setStr(s: String): Unit = str = str\r\n  def getStr(): String = str\r\n}\r\n\r\nscala> Seq(\"\"\"{\"cls\":null}\"\"\", \"\"\"{\"cls\": {\"str\":null}}\"\"\").toDF().write.text(\"data\")\r\nscala> val encoder = Encoders.bean(classOf[Outer])\r\nscala> val schema = encoder.schema\r\nscala> val df = spark.read.schema(schema).json(\"data\").as[Outer](encoder)\r\nscala> df.show\r\n+------+\r\n|   cls|\r\n+------+\r\n|[null]|\r\n|  null|\r\n+------+\r\n\r\nscala> df.map(x => x)(encoder).show()\r\n+------+\r\n|   cls|\r\n+------+\r\n|[null]|\r\n|[null]|     // <-- Value changed\r\n+------+\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is because the Bean serializer does not have the NULL-check expressions that the serializer of Scala's product types has. Actually, this value change does not happen in Scala's product types; \r\n\r\n```\r\nscala> :paste\r\ncase class Outer(cls: Inner)\r\ncase class Inner(str: String)\r\n\r\nscala> val encoder = Encoders.product[Outer]\r\nscala> val schema = encoder.schema\r\nscala> val df = spark.read.schema(schema).json(\"data\").as[Outer](encoder)\r\nscala> df.show\r\n+------+\r\n|   cls|\r\n+------+\r\n|[null]|\r\n|  null|\r\n+------+\r\n\r\nscala> df.map(x => x)(encoder).show()\r\n+------+\r\n|   cls|\r\n+------+\r\n|[null]|\r\n|  null|\r\n+------+\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis pr added the NULL-check expressions in Bean serializer along with the serializer of Scala's product types.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded tests in `JavaDatasetSuite`.\r\n","created_at":"2017-03-19T11:36:11Z","updated_at":"2017-03-21T03:32:35Z","closed_at":"2017-03-21T03:20:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"09c4c50ab4bfe3341ebf1c647409c21c3f1fa8f1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17347/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17347/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17347/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/77458a07e068b7091fd7bdedeaf9fb3e460c83e1","head":{"label":"maropu:SPARK-19980","ref":"SPARK-19980","sha":"77458a07e068b7091fd7bdedeaf9fb3e460c83e1","user":{"login":"maropu","id":692303,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MjMwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/692303?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu","html_url":"https://github.com/maropu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":27115199,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzExNTE5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"maropu/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"maropu","id":692303,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MjMwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/692303?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu","html_url":"https://github.com/maropu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/maropu/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen the individual partition size in a spill is small, mergeSpillsWithTransferTo method does many small disk ios which is really inefficient. One way to improve the performance will be to use mergeSpillsWithFileStream method by turning off transfer to and using buffered file read/write to improve the io throughput. \r\nHowever, the current implementation of mergeSpillsWithFileStream does not do a buffer read/write of the files and in addition to that it unnecessarily flushes the output files for each partitions.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTested this change by running a job on the cluster and the map stage run time was reduced by around 20%.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nmerge renameTable to alterTable in ExternalCatalog has some reasons:\r\n1. In Hive, we rename a Table by alterTable\r\n2. Currently when we create / rename a managed table, we should get the defaultTablePath for them in ExternalCatalog, then we have two defaultTablePath logic in its two subclass HiveExternalCatalog and InMemoryCatalog, additionally there is also a defaultTablePath in SessionCatalog, so till now we have three defaultTablePath in three classes. \r\nwe'd better to unify them up to SessionCatalog\r\n\r\nTo unify them, we should move some logic from ExternalCatalog to SessionCatalog, renameTable is one of this.\r\n\r\nwhile limit to the simple parameters in renameTable \r\n```\r\n  def renameTable(db: String, oldName: String, newName: String): Unit\r\n```\r\neven if we move the defaultTablePath logic to SessionCatalog, we can not pass it to renameTable.\r\n\r\nSo we can merge the renameTable  to alterTable, and rename it in alterTable.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\ndelete some tests in ExternalCatalogSuite which already existed in SessionCatalogSuite,\r\nand move some other tests  in ExternalCatalogSuite which does not exist in SessionCatalogSuite","created_at":"2017-03-18T12:24:51Z","updated_at":"2017-03-18T14:31:04Z","closed_at":"2017-03-18T14:31:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4231bd24877bb9ef2f14bf8285701b0dcf90432c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17340/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17340/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17340/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/bea0956ed0243a43c450e55d939792d633d9ee2b","head":{"label":"windpiger:renameTable","ref":"renameTable","sha":"bea0956ed0243a43c450e55d939792d633d9ee2b","user":{"login":"windpiger","id":12979185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTc5MTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12979185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/windpiger","html_url":"https://github.com/windpiger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/windpiger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/windpiger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/windpiger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/windpiger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/windpiger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/windpiger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/windpiger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/windpiger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/windpiger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":70575274,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3MDU3NTI3NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"windpiger/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"windpiger","id":12979185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTc5MTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12979185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/windpiger","html_url":"https://github.com/windpiger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/windpiger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/windpiger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/windpiger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/windpiger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/windpiger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/windpiger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/windpiger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/windpiger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/windpiger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/windpiger/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAfter sort merge join for inner join, now we only keep left key ordering. However, after inner join, right key has the same value and order as left key. So if we need another smj on right key, we will unnecessarily add a sort which causes additional cost.\r\n\r\nAs a more complicated example, A join B on A.key = B.key join C on B.key = C.key join D on A.key = D.key. We will unnecessarily add a sort on B.key when join {A, B} and C, and add a sort on A.key when join {A, B, C} and D.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, we need to propagate all sorted information (equivalent expressions) from bottom up through `outputOrdering` and `SortOrder`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTest cases are added.\r\n","created_at":"2017-03-18T06:31:05Z","updated_at":"2017-03-21T02:46:00Z","closed_at":"2017-03-21T02:46:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"46fcaeb7a1dbc86daf01b891f7d556f924ef176c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17339/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17339/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17339/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9d2ab549f19427ffc71ef9cef0517c080b71e31e","head":{"label":"wzhfy:sortEnhance","ref":"sortEnhance","sha":"9d2ab549f19427ffc71ef9cef0517c080b71e31e","user":{"login":"wzhfy","id":10878553,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODc4NTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10878553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy","html_url":"https://github.com/wzhfy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":66051854,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NjA1MTg1NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"wzhfy/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wzhfy","id":10878553,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODc4NTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10878553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy","html_url":"https://github.com/wzhfy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wzhfy/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAfter we have merged the `HiveDDLSuite` and `DDLSuite` in [SPARK-19235](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-19235), we have two subclasses of `DDLSuite`, that is `HiveCatalogedDDLSuite` and `InMemoryCatalogDDLSuite`.\r\n\r\nWhile `DDLSuite` is in `sql/core module`, and `HiveCatalogedDDLSuite` is in `sql/hive module`, if we mvn test \r\n`HiveCatalogedDDLSuite`, it will run the test in its parent class `DDLSuite`, this will cause some test case failed which will get and use the test file path in `sql/core module` 's `resource`.\r\n\r\nBecause the test file path getted will start with 'jar:' like \"jar:file:/home/jenkins/workspace/spark-master-test-maven-hadoop-2.6/sql/core/target/spark-sql_2.11-2.2.0-SNAPSHOT-tests.jar!/test-data/cars.csv\", which will failed when new Path() in datasource.scala\r\n\r\nThis PR fix this by copy file from resource to  a temp dir.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch

should always affect rules generation and transform. \r\nCurrently associationRules in FPGrowthModel is a lazy val and `setMinConfidence` in FPGrowthModel has no impact once associationRules got computed .\r\n\r\nI try to cache the associationRules to avoid re-computation if `minConfidence` is not changed, but this makes FPGrowthModel somehow stateful.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the current Spark on YARN code, we will obtain tokens from provided services, but we're not going to add these tokens to the current user's credentials. This will make all the following operations to these services still require TGT rather than delegation tokens. This is unnecessary since we already got the tokens, also this will lead to failure in user impersonation scenario, because the TGT is granted by real user, not proxy user.\r\n\r\nSo here changing to put all the tokens to the current UGI, so that following operations to these services will honor tokens rather than TGT, and this will further handle the proxy user issue mentioned above.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nLocal verified in secure cluster.\r\n\r\n@vanzin @tgravescs @mridulm  @dongjoon-hyun please help to review, thanks a

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR is to allow users to persist the output of a particular `PipelineStage` in the `Pipeline`. It also allows users to persist only a subset of output that is actually needed for the next stage instead of the whole big data frame.\r\n\r\nFor example, while running LDA a pipeline may look something like `Tokenizer` -> `StopWordRemover` -> `CountVectorizer` -> `LDA`. Here a user might want to `persist` the data frame coming out of `CountVectorizer` so that the LDA iterations work on this persisted data. Also, we need the flexibility to persist only the subset of columns (say docId, and features) that are needed for `LDA` rather than all extra columns that may have been added by the previous stages.\r\n\r\nAlso, another issue is that once the pipeline is fit on a data, for the `transform` on the same data it has to pass through all the previous stages again. In many cases this can be optimized if we already had access to data cached in the intermediate stage. In the example above, it will be useful if the data previously persisted in `CountVectorizer` can be reused to get `topicDistributions` from the `LDA` on the train data set itself. Otherwise, the data needs to *again* pass through all the stages.\r\n\r\nFor this, the `PipelineStage` exposes following methods\r\n* `persist(level: StorageLevel, colExprs: String*)` - where the user can specify storage level and subset of the output dataframe of the stage to be persisted.\r\n* `persist(colExprs: String*)` - uses default storage level.\r\n* `getPersistedDf(): Option[DataFrame]` - to retrieve the cached data frame for a stage. This will be useful when we only need to run the pipeline from a specific stage. For instance, `pipelineModel.transform(countVectorizer.getPersistedDf.get)` should only run the final `LDA` stage of the pipeline. The persisted dataframe s only available once the `Pipeline.fit` has been called.\r\n\r\nChanges in `Pipeline`\r\n* The `fit` method checks whether a particular stage is marked to persist its output. If yes, it marks the output data frame as persistent according to the storage level and column subset. For `Executors` in the stage, it associates the persistant dataframe with both the `Executor` as well as the resultant `Transformer`.\r\n* The `transformSchema` methods is changes so that the column pruning as result of specifying subset columns for persisting is taken into account.\r\n\r\nChanges in `PipelineModel`\r\n* `transform(dataset)` method now checks if the dataset argument was persisted in any of the stages during `Pipeline.fit`.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFor right outer join, values of the left key will be filled with nulls if it can't match the value of the right key, so `nullOrdering` of the left key can't be guaranteed. We should output right key order instead of left key order.\r\n\r\nFor full outer join, neither left key nor right key guarantees `nullOrdering`. We should not output any ordering.\r\n\r\nIn tests, besides adding three test cases for left/right/full outer sort merge join, this patch also reorganizes code in `PlannerSuite` by putting together tests for `Sort`, and also extracts common logic in Sort tests into a method.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nCorresponding test cases are added.\r\n","created_at":"2017-03-17T07:11:32Z","updated_at":"2017-03-21T10:35:21Z","closed_at":"2017-03-20T06:39:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"42995561618391643298a907ac706d37b7f96380","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17331/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17331/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17331/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e4c41dcbca9afdcce5ebe44836f5f8cef0a01bb4","head":{"label":"wzhfy:wrongOrdering","ref":"wrongOrdering","sha":"e4c41dcbca9afdcce5ebe44836f5f8cef0a01bb4","user":{"login":"wzhfy","id":10878553,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODc4NTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10878553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy","html_url":"https://github.com/wzhfy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":66051854,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NjA1MTg1NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"wzhfy/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wzhfy","id":10878553,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODc4NTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10878553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy","html_url":"https://github.com/wzhfy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wzhfy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wzhfy/spark","description":"Mirror

However, in the places where we check for this, we throw a confusing error message.\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch made two major changes:\r\n1. added a `parseVersion(...)` method, and based on this method, fixed the following places the way they did version checking (no other place needed to do this checking):\r\n```\r\nHDFSMetadataLog\r\n  - CompactibleFileStreamLog  ------------> fixed with this patch\r\n    - FileStreamSourceLog  ---------------> inherited the fix of `CompactibleFileStreamLog`\r\n    - FileStreamSinkLog  -----------------> inherited the fix of `CompactibleFileStreamLog`\r\n  - OffsetSeqLog  ------------------------> fixed with this patch\r\n  - anonymous subclass in KafkaSource  ---> fixed with this patch\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. changed the type of `FileStreamSinkLog.VERSION`, `FileStreamSourceLog.VERSION` etc. from `String` to `Int`, so that we can identify newer versions via `version > 1` instead of `version != \"v1\"`\r\n    - note this didn't break any backwards compatibility -- we are still writing out `\"v1\"` and reading back `\"v1\"`\r\n\r\n## Exception message with this patch\r\n```\r\njava.lang.IllegalStateException: Failed to read log file /private/var/folders/nn/82rmvkk568sd8p3p8tb33trw0000gn/T/spark-86867b65-0069-4ef1-b0eb-d8bd258ff5b8/0.
