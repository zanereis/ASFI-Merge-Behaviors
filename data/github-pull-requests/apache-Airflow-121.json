of ambiguity of treating \"*\" in SQLAlchemy 4.1.42 made our tests to fail, because they were trying to execute the query from aliased table as a standalone queryi for verificaiton, where in

change #27912 fixed and unified behaviour of DBApiHooks across the board, but it missed two places where sql was mis-used and overridden in exasol and snowflake hooks.\r\n\r\nThe check for \"sql\" type did not use the original sql parameter value but the one that was overridden later in the run method implementation.\r\n\r\nThe fix is the same as applied in Databricks Hook and DBAPI generic run methods - using consistent typing and separate variable to convert the sql string into sql list.\r\n\r\nRelated: https://github.com/astronomer/astro-sdk/pull/1324\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for

noticed a case where the same local providers were loaded more than\nonce, and it turned out to be caused by having `.` in the python search\npath.\n\nThe fix for this is to canonicalize the path before looking for\nproviders in it, and not searching in a path more than once.\n\nThis also caused a number of warnings of \"provider already loaded\" to appear.\n\n(All of thise only affects people running from a checkout of Airflow)\n\n<!--\nThank you for contributing!

calculate all the independent graphs in the datasets view, we start with a graph for each edge with no upstreams and then merge them once we find a common edge. This wasn't merging nodes correctly, sometimes the same node was added over and over for every edge it had. I found a patch for the fix, but then realized that the logic was quite brittle and decided to refactor.\r\nWe only need the edges to figure out the graph, so we just recursively iterate over those. Using `.reduce` and `.map` instead of weird `indicesToRemove` objects. Once all the edges are placed, we add the nodes.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.rst#pull-request-guidelines)** for more information.\r\nIn case of fundamental code changes, an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvement+Proposals)) is needed.\r\nIn case of a new dependency, check compliance with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\nIn case of backwards incompatible changes please leave a note in a newsfragment file, named `{pr_number}.significant.rst` or `{issue_number}.significant.rst`, in [newsfragments](https://github.com/apache/airflow/tree/main/newsfragments).\r\n","created_at":"2022-11-29T16:15:31Z","updated_at":"2023-01-09T22:40:52Z","closed_at":"2022-11-30T22:35:06Z","merged_at":"2022-11-30T22:35:06Z","merge_commit_sha":"f1c4c27e4aed79eef01f2873fab3a66af2aa3fa0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ryanahamilton","id":3267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanahamilton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545584474,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTg0NDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:webserver","name":"area:webserver","color":"a9db3f","default":false,"description":"Webserver related Issues"},{"id":2172802142,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcyODAyMTQy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:misc/internal","name":"type:misc/internal","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog: Misc changes that should appear in change log"},{"id":2514952451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTE0OTUyNDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:UI","name":"area:UI","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"Related to UI/UX.

had recently some mishaps when it comes to changes to the common.sql provider that accidentally changed API of the common.sql providers and they passed both tests and reviews.\r\n\r\nCommon.sql is pretty special provider because it used by other providers and we have to make sure the API it epxoses is backwards compatible, otherwise upgrading common.sql provider might break those providers.\r\n\r\nThis had already happened:\r\n\r\n* The #26761 refactored common.sql provided and removed some methods that were actually used by Google Provider\r\n\r\n* This caused a problem described in #27838 and forced us ot yank common.sql 1.3.0 and release 1.3.1 with the methods added back in #27843\r\n\r\nThis change introduces tools and process to flag common.sql API changes that are likely backwards compatible.\r\n\r\nThey will require a deliberate action from the contributor who introduces a breaking API to common.sql, it will also help to flag to reviewer when such a change is made.\r\n\r\nThe idea is based on how Android OS handles flagging API changes for their public APIs paired with the tooling that MyPy provides with generating stubs and verifying usage of packages in the stubs.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

had recently some mishaps when it comes to changes to the common.sql provider that accidentally changed API of the common.sql providers and they passed both tests and reviews.\r\n\r\nCommon.sql is pretty special provider because it used by other providers and we have to make sure the API it epxoses is backwards compatible, otherwise upgrading common.sql provider might break those providers.\r\n\r\nThis had already happened:\r\n\r\n* The #26761 refactored common.sql provided and removed some methods that were actually used by Google Provider\r\n\r\n* This caused a problem described in #27838 and forced us ot yank common.sql 1.3.0 and release 1.3.1 with the methods added back in #27843\r\n\r\nThis change introduces tools and process to flag common.sql API changes that are likely backwards compatible.\r\n\r\nThey will require a deliberate action from the contributor who introduces a breaking API to common.sql, it will also help to flag to reviewer when such a change is made.\r\n\r\nThe idea is based on how Android OS handles flagging API changes for their public APIs.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

#26571\r\n\r\nThis PR contains the following:\r\n\r\n* Implemented the following bullet points outlined in #26571:\r\n    * Removed `ast.literal_eval` for deserializing JSON secrets.\r\n    * Removed `full_url_mode` kwarg entirely. JSONs are now automatically detected.\r\n    * Removed requirement that `get_conn_value()` must return a URI.\r\n        * **Note that this means that the AWS provider package will no longer work with Airflow 2.2.x and requires 2.3.0 or greater.**\r\n     * Removed requirement that secrets must be URL-encoded when stored as JSONs.\r\n         * **Note that this change will be breaking for some users, although the current AWS provider package should be raising `DeprecationWarning`s for users who will be affected.**\r\n    * Set `login` as the default name for the login with the JSON standardization thing in `_standardize_secret_keys`.\r\n* Updated docs to reflect these changes.\r\n    * Removed all references to full URL mode.\r\n    * Provided what I believe to be much clearer examples of AWS Secrets Manager setup.\r\n    * Moved the docs to being more consistent with Airflow's base secrets API, e.g. `login` instead of `user`, `password` instead of `pass`, etc. + I wrote a note saying that using these names is encouraged.\r\n    * I also raised the header levels a little bit across the doc; they were very low!\r\n\r\nAs stated in #26571, the intent with this PR (as well as the one leading up to it that added a bunch of deprecation warnings) is to make it so the secret values accepted by the `SecretsManagerBackend` are a strict superset of what is allowed by the `BaseSecretsBackend`, and behave in the same way, so as to adhere to the principle of behavioral subtyping.\r\n\r\nFor both the reasons stated above in bold-- this is incompatible with Airflow 2.2.x, and a small number of users will be hit by backwards incompatibility after implementing this change-- merging this PR would require a major version bump of the Amazon provider package.","created_at":"2022-11-25T18:34:04Z","updated_at":"2023-03-23T19:04:21Z","closed_at":"2022-12-05T19:21:54Z","merged_at":"2022-12-05T19:21:54Z","merge_commit_sha":"8f0265d0d9079a8abbd7b895ada418908d8b9909","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1471852032,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDcxODUyMDMy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:amazon","name":"provider:amazon","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"AWS/Amazon

task group mapping is implemented, the semantic of an operator being \"mapped\" becomes ambiguous, since it can mean either \"the operator is itself mapped\" (i.e. a MappedOperator) or \"the operator is mapped to multiple task instances\" (can be either a MappedOperator, or inside a MappedTaskGroup). This makes the use of the \"is_mapped\" flag awkward and induces some subtle bugs found during testing.\r\n\r\nTherefore, this PR proposes to remove the is_mapped flag, and rely entirely on isinstance checks to more explicitly identify the two kinds of task mapping constructs instead. A couple of bugs are also caught during refactoring.\r\n\r\nNote that the is_mapped fields in *serialized formats* (serialized operator, and JSON responses returned by API calls) are not removed, so front end code is not affected. The fields are simply modified to also rely on isinstance checks.\r\n\r\nWould also fix

rosetta terminal (not sure why because [the code includes a flush](https://github.com/johejo/inputimeout/blob/master/inputimeout/inputimeout.py#L18), but anyway), so I added a newline character, which

https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/27113 we expanded listener API with lifecycle methods - `on_starting` and `before_finish`. Those allow plugin authors set up and teardown their plugin if needed.  \r\n\r\nThis PR adds the lifecycle method to `task command`, as listener methods are called in this process: `on_task_instance_success` and `on_task_instance_failure`, so it would be useful to set up plugin process properly in this context too. \r\n\r\nPreviously, this PR was adding this to `StandardTaskRunner`, but it needed to be done in `task command` as previous version would not cover `exec path`.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Maciej Obuchowski

SQLExecuteQueryOperator has been introduced in https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/25717, it\r\nintroduced some errors in the Databricks SQL operator:\r\n\r\n* The schema (description) parameter has been passed as _process_output\r\n  parameter from Hook's output\r\n* The run() method of DatabricksHook was not conforming to other\r\n  run methods of the Hook - it was returning Tuple of the\r\n  result/description\r\n* The _process_output type was not specified - if scalar was used\r\n  it returned different output than without it and it was not\r\n  specified in the DBApiHook.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes it by:\r\n\r\n* the Databricks Hook is now conformant to the other DBAPIHooks in\r\n  terms of value returned by Hook (backwards incompatible so we\r\n  need to bump major version of the provider)\r\n* the DBApiHook now has \"last_description\" field which on one hand\r\n  makes it stateless, on the other, the state reflects the\r\n  description of the last run method and is not a problem to keep.\r\n  This implies 1.4 version of common-sql provider as this is a new\r\n  feature for the provider\r\n* the DBApiHook now has \"scalar_return_last\" field that indicates\r\n  if scalar output was specified.\r\n* Python dbapi's \"description\" is properly named now - previously it was\r\n  \"schema\" which clashed with the \"schema\" name passed to hook\r\n  initialisation - the actual database schema\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!
