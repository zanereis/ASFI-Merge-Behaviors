- we replaced query in state with queryResponse in [https://github.com/airbnb/superset/pull/2005](url), then pass query instead of slice to DisplayQueryButton in [https://github.com/airbnb/superset/pull/1948](url). (The reason was that query was sent back to ChartContainer after slice rendering is done, by the time we don't want to change mock slice object but want to change query) However in v1 the query is still stored in the slice object\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\nthis is a temporary hack to get query button working for v1, the bug should be automatically resolved after v1

Vertica, inner queries require different aliases than the main query.\r\n\r\nThis is an example of query generated before this patch:\r\n```\r\nSELECT chain AS chain,\r\n                weekstartday

proposing an initial plugins system.\r\n\r\nThe idea is to have a `plugins` directory containing mostly empty files, which are already \"properly  linked\" in the code. This way, one can tweak Superset, but also easily upgrade to newer versions, with low-to-none merge conflicts. (This is heavily inspired by Airflow.)\r\n\r\nAt shopkick we're using superset since 0.10, did a lot of internal small patches, mostly personalizing the UI, and every time there's an update re-merging is a pretty painful operation.\r\n\r\nWith this current system, we're currently personalizing:\r\n- bootstrap variables, notably the brand color\r\n- other css\r\n- colors, very important for our internal/core metrics\r\n- additional personalized visualizations (probably too personalized to be added to the main branch)\r\n- views, with their own template, including static pages, additional api calls, etc.\r\n- generic python extensions, e.g. a security class that auto-register users if the email domain is the correct one (again, probably too personalized to be added in the main branch)\r\n\r\nYou can see an example of the plugins system in action here:\r\nhttps://github.com/shopkick/superset/tree/sk_0.15.2/superset/plugins\r\n\r\nTo reiterate, the main purpose is to have empty files somewhere that one can personalize as she likes, without incurring in merge conflicts when a new version is released. In principle every single piece of Superset can be extended in a similar fashion, but I'm not a fan of too general implementations, I'd grow the list of supported features as the community requires them.\r\n\r\nPlease LMK what do you think,

data asynchronously from the backend on their own. \r\n\r\nAfter this PR, viz will be a simple function that receives a payload (the response from the backend) as well as a slice object, and are expected to mutate the dom all they want. The framework's container objects are now in charge of fetching the data and handling success/errors.\r\n\r\nA side mission was around refactoring the ChartContainer object by moving the querying into a redux action creator, and simplifying the lifecycle of the component quite a bit. For clarity, we now put the queryResponse in the state.\r\n\r\nNote that this PR gets rid of 3-ish hundred lines of code.\r\n\r\nStill TODO:\r\n\r\n* fix some bugs in V2 around height handling\r\n*

small and specific bug around using Advanced Analytics in Line Charts. \r\n\r\nThere is unexpected behavior when using both Rolling and Period ratio in conjunction.  Based on the code (https://github.com/airbnb/superset/blob/master/superset/viz.py#L1190-L1215), all we do is compute the period ratio however specified, then do rolling windows thereafter. This is pretty counter-intuitive. Basically, when I select rolling sum of 7 days and period compare of 1, it gives me a time series that sums those factors (it will be ~7, and not anywhere near 1)! Which is not really something anybody would want to do. If we switch the steps for period compare and rolling computations, that would make sense. I want to compare each rolling 7 day window with the previous (1 before) rolling 7 day window. The problem doesn't surface for values, but only for factor and growth modes.\r\n\r\nEventually it may make sense to think about how these operations interact but for now switching order is sufficient.\r\n\r\n@mistercrunch

based on feedback from alex: \"Working really well so far - one thing I noticed is missing is the ability to edit the data source from the slice view.

Not a huge issue, but was convenient before!\"\r\n\r\nI know @mistercrunch had some ideas about how to handle editing/adding columns or metrics for a datasource within the explore view, but for now would like to get this in so it's more convenient for users to edit the datasource.

per #1131, I added more detailed tests for logging in and a test for the + button when adding a slice. I tried breaking the login page and the `add` function for adding a slice in `models.py` and the tests caught the breakage.\r\n\r\nOne question I had was whether to use python's assert syntax as in `assert x in y` or use unittest's assert function as in `AssertEqual(x,y)`. I see both usages across the tests so which do you prefer I use?\r\n\r\nI will work on adding tests for adding a datasource. Are there any other tests you would like me to add? I feel like the best way to get my feet wet with a project is writing tests so I would be happy to write more tests before adding features.\r\n\r\nAny comments appreciated and thank you for your time

field configuration\r\n* making the backend endpoint `fetch_datasource_metadata` do just that, no more backend logic that \"broadcasts\" field options into the state, instead [more generically] the fields define how they pick from the state to define their props (often `choices` in the current use cases)\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n`fetch_datasource_metadata` could be simplified further to expose the raw array of objects of columns and metrics, and more logic to build options could be moved to the js side.

when a query fails for whatever reason, the previous query is shown in the `Query` modal.

even in case of failure.\r\n\r\nRelated improvements/refactor:\r\n* a better `always` function in explorev1, for logic that needs to happen on failure and success\r\n* more error handling in the

PR is in relation to issue #985.\r\n\r\nThe first commit basically converts all existing hard coded urls in superset to use the Flask `url_for` method to generate urls. \r\n\r\nThe second commit adds a middleware that runs all tests under the prefix `/test` to make sure that future contributions will not add in hard coded urls again. It also fixes current tests that wouldn't work with the new prefix. \r\n\r\nI need to clean some of this up a bit, but wanted to create the PR now to get some feedback before I do much more with it.\r\n\r\nIf you want to go with running tests under a prefix, there are a some complications due to the fact that `url_for` needs the application context in order to resolve the urls. And it needs to be prepared with the right prefix to give the right urls. In addition, any test code that runs app code which generates urls need to wrap this code in an app context as well (exceptions being `self.client.get/post`). I have added a number of help methods to the `SupersetTestCase` class that should help people out (`self.url_for`, `self.get_app_context`. It still requires a bit more from the test code though since app context mishaps give very confusing errors.\r\n\r\nAnything I missed, should change, etc., Please let me know","created_at":"2016-12-19T15:01:42Z","updated_at":"2023-11-26T14:44:04Z","closed_at":"2017-08-11T06:00:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c170e0ca5a9c56c8de8eeb717a150190d4d02671","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/pulls/1866/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/pulls/1866/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/1866/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/statuses/0ab1b208766132359a060657ce86d42e1b1c333c","head":{"label":"ecometrica:fix-hardcoded-url-python","ref":"fix-hardcoded-url-python","sha":"0ab1b208766132359a060657ce86d42e1b1c333c","user":{"login":"ecometrica","id":220745,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjIyMDc0NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/220745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecometrica","html_url":"https://github.com/ecometrica","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecometrica/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecometrica/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecometrica/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecometrica/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecometrica/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecometrica/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecometrica/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecometrica/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecometrica/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"c2d29fb54bbe8e57bdee03f4f4940469b48c2a92","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":39464018,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTQ2NDAxOA==","name":"superset","full_name":"apache/superset","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset","description":"Apache
