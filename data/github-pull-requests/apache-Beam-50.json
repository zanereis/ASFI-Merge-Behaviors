were running into an issue where a worker would fail (for whatever reason) after a load job was submitted to BigQuery but before it could finish and return as successful. In Beam's perspective, this is a bundle failure and so the bundle is retried. The same files are collected into a load configuration and a job is again submitted to BigQuery **with a different job ID**. Now BigQuery receives two essentially identical load jobs under different names and accepts both, which leads to duplication of data in the table.\r\n\r\nThis PR serves to make load job names deterministic so that under such a scenario when Beam retries by loading the same files, it will use the same job ID. When BigQuery receives the same job ID, it returns a 409 \"already exists\" error, which we already handle.\r\n- use partition key for copy job cases\r\n- use pane index for streaming\r\n\r\nOther steps in this write method (copy jobs, schema update, table deletion) are already

continuation of #27333 \r\nand a little bit contrary to the approach in #27329 \r\nAssuming that JdbcIO may yield row with INT14 and FixedNumeric(precision, scale). \r\nThe challenge is how to handle them in Avro. \r\nI made a mistake to picking both of types in the beginning. \r\n\r\n- It seems that Decimal with scale can be just implemented.   \r\n- but INT16 looks like a blocker. \r\n\r\n@aromanenko-dev could you please advise how to handle INT16 in Avro. I understand that Avro has only four bytes int, but where this conversion may happen. Should it happen? Or it's just somehow rejected with suggesting to convert types explicitly. This question stands for: GenericAvroRecord, SpecificAvroRecord and AvroPojo.  Thank you so much.\r\n\r\nFWIW In these draft changes some things went quite good.

is what I have done\r\n\r\n- added recursive call to generate_user_type_from_bq_schema\r\n- This change implies that the object field_names_and_types passed to named_fields_to_schema may already contain a named tuple object instead of plain python types. Therefore:\r\n- adjusted input to named_fields_to_schema to prevent it from parsing all sequence elements which contain already processed elements\r\n- added new parameter to named_tuple_from_schema to overwrite certain positions in returned named tuple with already processed elements\r\n\r\nThe current implementation results in errors upon execution as discussed [here](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/27166#issuecomment-1600533589). Also, under the same link, I have formulated three overarching discussion points with this implementation that I would like to discuss:\r\n\r\n1. Is the PTransform implementation already aware of 'nested' row entries? As far as I understand, the named tuple object returned by generate_user_type_from_bq_schema will be mapped onto the existing PCollection within the transformations expand method.\r\n1. Is it desired that nested schemas will get registered multiple times in this setup? See https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/5e942ae3790bc95148413c43ab7e43a01a2d82ae/sdks/python/apache_beam/typehints/schemas.py#L533-L542\r\n1. Can we drop the calls to named_fields_to_schema and named_tuple_from_schema in generate_user_type_from_bq_schema altogether and create the (nested) named tuple object manually? If so, we would of course lose the type checking functionalities build into these two methods.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to the discussion :)\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

pull request adds the following changes:\r\n\r\n- Adds the `-Ppush-containers` build parameter to push and save multi-arch containers as a manifest list. \r\n- Explicitly adds tensorflow-cpu-aws as an

Dataflow runner so that the containers built are multi-arch and being used to test. \r\n\r\nRelated issues:\r\nExplicitly install tensorflow-cpu-aws:

the Go quickstart to reduce the environmental demand on a user. This PR fixes walls users might encounter from following the instructions.\r\n\r\n* Move from installing the wordcount to simply executing it. Installing runs the risk the user doesn't have the go/bin directory on their PATH (or OS equivalent). We shouldn't make this assumption.\r\n* Remove unnecessary steps leading to execution.\r\n* Reference the Beam Go Starter project in next steps.\r\n\r\nThe Quickstart really should jump from that to building a pipeline from scratch with Go and explain a little bit more about what's going on, as Quickstarts are often a first landing page for new users. But that's a task for a later PR.\r\n\r\nFixes #27207 \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Include jobs failed by requirements reasons pre-execution in the job list.\r\n* More gracefully handle DoFn/SDK harness bundle failures instead of panicking the runner.\r\n* Adds context cancelation observation to the server side Control implementation.\r\n\r\nThis adds an initial spot where Retries might be added in the future, and a single point for where Job error messages will flow. Still todo is the right way to surface the actual failure message to the user rather than in the runner logs, since job failure states don't include messages. Likely would pass/extract these along the message stream, which could also surface them on the UI and API.\r\n\r\nAn SDK side change could be made to try and extract the last message from the job management server if available, and produce that with the returned error, but this would be SDK specific and per SDK without a more involved JobManagement API change proposal.\r\n\r\nThis isn't a comprehensive overhaul of job abort, which likely needs more work. I suspect that the full failure flow will need additional investigation, such as when there are additional extant elements, and ensuring stray goroutines are cleaned up.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
