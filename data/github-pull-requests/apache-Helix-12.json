Issues\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR title:\r\nFixes #984 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nIn this commit, several parts of the code have been removed in order to avoid\r\nmaking scheduling decision based on PreviousAssignment. Instead we are relying on\r\nthe CurrentState. \r\nIn order to facilitate this, the tasks that reaches the terminal state \r\n(Error, Time_out, Aborted and completed) will be dropped and rescheduled in later\r\npipeline if needed (If they need to be rescheduled). This helps us to reduce the\r\nnumber of existing current states for each task. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Failures: \r\n[ERROR]   TestWorkflowTermination.testWorkflowJobFail:251->verifyWorkflowCleanup:257 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[ERROR]   TestWorkflowTimeout.testWorkflowTimeoutWhenWorkflowCompleted:116 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1144, Failures: 2, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD FAILURE\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:21 h\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-05-01T15:25:20-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe failed tests has passed when I ran it individually. \r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n(#990 )\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nCurrently there is a bug in the version comparison logic for compatibility check stage. It worked with all version starting with number \"0\". However, the comparison check would fail after we release version 1.0.0. The impact is the pipeline that includes compatibility check stage would fail due to the incompatibility error.\r\nThis PR fixed the issue by modifying the logic in the loop. If the participant version's digit number is larger than the minimum version digit number, we terminate the loop.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nTestCompatibilityCheckStage.\r\n\r\n- [X] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\nhelix-rest\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 159, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 32.061 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 159, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  36.217 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-05-03T12:01:15-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nhelix-core:\r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1144, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 1, Time elapsed: 4,742.047 s <<< FAILURE! - in TestSuite\r\n[ERROR] testJobQueueAutoCleanUp(org.apache.helix.integration.task.TestJobQueueCleanUp)  Time elapsed: 300.01 s  <<< FAILURE!\r\norg.testng.internal.thread.ThreadTimeoutException: Method org.testng.internal.TestNGMethod.testJobQueueAutoCleanUp() didn't finish within the time-out 300000\r\n\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Failures: \r\n[ERROR]   TestJobQueueCleanUp.testJobQueueAutoCleanUp » ThreadTimeout Method org.testng....\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1144, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 1\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n#985\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThe old state assignment logic assign the states to selected nodes according to the priority of the current replica state that is on the instance. Moreover, the sorting algorithm is designed to prioritize both current topstate and current secondary states equally. The result is that we will have premature mastership handoff to a current seconardy state host before the real desired master host is ready. For example,\r\n1. The current states are: [N1:M, N2:S, N3,S]\r\n2. The desired states are: [N4:M, N2:S, N1:S]\r\n3. Due to the sorting logic based on current states, we will have a transient preference list ordered like: [N2, N1, N4]. In which case, the controller will assign master to N2 before N4 has a slave state replica.\r\n4. When N4 finishes the Offline to Slave transition, the same sorting logic will sort the preference list to be: [N4, N2, N1]. Then we have another mastership handoff.\r\nTo be clear, we don't want step 3. But only the state transition in step 4.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we refactor the sorting logic so that it will only move the master whenever the candidate has a \"ready\" state replica, in which case, only one mastership handoff happens.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nAdd the test scenario to TestAbstractRebalancer.\r\n\r\n- [X] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Failures: \r\n[ERROR]   TestJobQueueCleanUp.testJobQueueAutoCleanUp » ThreadTimeout Method org.testng....\r\n[ERROR]   TestWorkflowTimeout.testWorkflowTimeoutWhenWorkflowCompleted:116 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1145, Failures: 2, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD FAILURE\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time: 01:21 h\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-04-30T23:30:07-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nRerun:\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 7, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 30.931 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 7, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time: 37.212 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-04-30T23:32:13-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines.

Issues\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR title:\r\nFixes #977 \r\nFixes #978 \r\nFixes #979 \r\nFixes #980 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nTestJobFailure was unstable because we get ExternalView of a resources and if the ExternalView is not populated yet by the controller, we hit NullPointerException.\r\n\r\nTestRebalanceRunningTask was unstable. In this PR, we make sure that the master is existed in two different nodes (master is switched to new instance) and then we check the assigned participants.\r\n\r\nTestRebalanceStopAndResume was unstable because of Thread.Sleep usage. Instead of stopping the workflow after some time, we first make sure that workflow and job is IN_PROGRESS and then stop the workflow.\r\n\r\nTestTaskSchedulingTwoCurrent has been stabilized by making sure that master has been switched to new instance after modifying IS. After that we make sure that task is assigned to the correct instance and make sure it does not switched to new instance and cancel is not being called incorrectly.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\nTest Result:\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Failures: \r\n[ERROR]   TestTaskRebalancer.timeouts:200 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[ERROR]   TestWorkflowTermination.testWorkflowRunningTimeout:131->verifyWorkflowCleanup:257 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[ERROR]   TestClusterVerifier.testResourceSubset:225 expected:<false> but was:<true>\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1144, Failures: 3, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD FAILURE\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:18 h\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-04-29T11:25:52-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe failed tests has passed when I ran it individually. The failed tests also need to be stabilized later\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #972\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nWe are improving the task framework by allowing task thread pools to have configurable sizes. As a part of the participant side change, `TaskStateModelFactory` is changed to allocate thread pool sizes based on values provided in `InstanceConfig` or `ClusterConfig`.\r\n\r\nBoth `InstanceConfig` and `ClusterConfig` are now expected to contain a field keyed as \"TARGET_TASK_THREAD_POOL_SIZE\", where the value for `InstanceConfig` only determines the thread pool size for the specified instance, and the value for `ClusterConfig` determines the thread pool sizes for all instances of that cluster. If `InstanceConfig` isn't able to provide the pool size, then `ClusterConfig` will be used to determine the pool size; if neither of them are able to provide the pool size, `TaskStateModelFactory` will use a default value.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Failures: \r\n[ERROR]   TestEnableCompression.testEnableCompressionResource:117 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[ERROR]   TestZkConnectionLost.testLostZkConnection:140 » Helix Workflow \"testLostZkConn...\r\n[ERROR]   TestStateTransitionTimeout.testStateTransitionTimeOut:166 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[ERROR]   TestStateTransitionTimeoutWithResource.testStateTransitionTimeOut:171 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1144, Failures: 4, Errors: 0, Skipped: 1\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD FAILURE\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:15 h\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-05-12T12:22:14-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\nRerun failed classes\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 5, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 71.032 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 5, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:16 min\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-05-12T14:13:00-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n#969 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nIf any exceptions happen during the async call, the current design will fail the operation and may eventually return a partial result.\r\nThis change makes the ZkClient retry operation if the error is because of a temporary ZK connection issue (CONNECTIONLOSS, SESSIONEXPIRED, SESSIONMOVED).\r\nSo the async call has a larger chance to finish the operation. Note that if the exception is due to business logic, the async call will still fail and the right return code will be sent to the callback handler.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nTestZkClientAsyncRetry\r\n\r\nKeep running 75 times to ensure it's stable.\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 4, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 6.558 s - in org.apache.helix.zookeeper.impl.client.TestZkClientAsyncRetry\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 4, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time: 10.896 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-04-25T15:56:37-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n//======================================================================\r\nAttempt 75 TestZkClientAsyncRetry\r\n//======================================================================\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n**zookeeper-api**\r\n\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 24, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 7.118 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 24, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time: 13.684 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-04-25T16:20:32-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**helix-core**\r\n\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1144, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 4,621.077 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1144, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time: 01:17 h\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-04-27T12:34:24-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n**helix-rest**\r\n\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 159, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 193.83 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 159, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  03:19 min\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-04-25T16:51:55-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #965 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n - In these tests, the zkClient is trying to read/write ZNRecords, but zkClient's serializer is not a `ZNRecordSerializer` but a `BasicZkSerializer`. So when read/write a ZNRecord, a `ZkMarshallingError` is thrown and causes the tests failed.\r\n- Some developers don't see these failures, because the ordering of running tests are different on different environments (different maven version, OS). And the zkClient's is a based one and its serializer type is changed to ZNRecordSerializer in other tests. So if other tests are run before TestZkRoutingDataWriter, the tests pass. Otherwise, some developers would see the failures.\r\n - Change the zkClient to `_gZkClientTestNS` which uses ZNRecordSerializer\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nFix tests:\r\n - TestZkRoutingDataWriter\r\n - TestZkRoutingDataReader\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 159, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 44.264 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 159, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  50.445 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-04-23T13:12:15-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFor distributed systems that use Helix, there is a common request for a mechanism to make sure different processes can cooperate correctly. For example, if two processes that run on different machines, or different networks, or even different data centers would like to work on the same resource, we must have a mutually exclusive lock to secure their operations do not step on each other. Only when a process acquires the lock, it can perform the operation. This PR adds a distributed lock module into Helix.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n- Non blocking lock implementation. It creates an API to acquire the lock that will immediately return true if it's successfully acquired, or false if not. Also an API to unlock the lock is provded.\r\n- Timeout support. The client need to input the timeout when it tries to acquire the lock. After timeout, if no other client tries to get the lock, the client can still keep the lock, if other client tries to acquire the lock, and finds the previous client already timeout, the previous client will be forced to release the lock.\r\n- Lock message support. The client can input the reason for the lock (a string) when it tries to acquire the lock, and future lock operation, when fails, will get the message for the current lock.\r\n- Java API support.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nTestZKHelixNonblockingLock.java\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO]\r\n[ERROR] Failures:\r\n[ERROR] TestStateTransitionTimeoutWithResource.testStateTransitionTimeOut:171 expected: but was:\r\n[INFO]\r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1122, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD FAILURE\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time: 01:13 h\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-04-22T16:02:23-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR implements Helix customized state view aggregation feature. This feature allow Helix users to have their own defined states for each partition, provide them APIs to update the states when there's any change, and also help them aggregate the customized states into a customized view similar to existing external view. Finally, users could get the aggregated view from routing table provider. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n(List the names of added unit/integration tests)\r\n\r\n- [X] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\nTestCustomizedStateUpdate\r\nTestCustomizedStateComputationStage\r\nTestCustomizedViewStage\r\nTestComputeAndCleanupCustomizedView\r\nTestCustomizedViewAggregation\r\n\r\n[WARNING] Tests run: 1144, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 1, Time elapsed: 4,645.631 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[WARNING] Tests run: 1144, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 1\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:17 h\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-04-23T12:02:40-07:00\r\n\r\nhelix-rest: (known issues, will be fixed in the following PRs)\r\n\r\n[ERROR] Failures: \r\n[ERROR]   TestZkRoutingDataReader.testGetRoutingData:81 » ZkMarshalling java.io.NotSeria...\r\n[ERROR]   TestZkRoutingDataWriter.testAddMetadataStoreRealm:87 » ZkMarshalling java.io.S...\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 159, Failures: 2, Errors: 0, Skipped: 11\r\n[INFO] \r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nCurrent DistributedLock interface API names can be confusing for users, since they are not following java convention. For example: we have acquireLock for both blocking (wait until the lock is release to acquire the lock) and nonblocking locks (return result immediately when called to acquire the lock). \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nAPI changes:\r\n\r\nacquireLock -> tryLock: nonblocking lock\r\nreleaseLock -> unlock\r\n\r\nAPI not included in this PR:\r\naquireLock -> lock: blocking lock\r\nThis API is not included in the interface yet, because it is not in the current scope. The API is written here so it is clear that now we will be able to have two different APIs to acquire the lock according to different mechanism.\r\n\r\nAlso this PR changed some imports for ZooKeeper related APIs because we have a separate module for ZK APIs now.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Failures: \r\n[ERROR]   TestStateTransitionTimeoutWithResource.testStateTransitionTimeOut:171 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1122, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD FAILURE\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:13 h\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-04-22T16:02:23-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

It may be caused by stopping the controllers. A better approach is to pause the clusters instead.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 155, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 29.911 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 155, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  34.510 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-04-20T12:02:05-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines.

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes part of #939 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n1. Routing data update methods in ZkMetadataStoreDirectory writes routing data to ZK and refresh routing cache. However, it should not refresh routing data if writing to ZK fails. Refreshing routing should only be proceeded if writing to ZK is successful.\r\n\r\n2. The test is flaky because of removing namespace when refreshing routing data. It is caused by race condition between the read request after updating and data change callback to refresh routing (which is second refresh). Namespace should only be removed when exception is thrown.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nFix TestZkMetadataStoreDirectory\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\nBefore: TestZkMetadataStoreDirectory failed within 5 attempts.\r\nAfter: 50 attempts of running TestZkMetadataStoreDirectory passed\r\n\r\nIn helix-rest:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 155, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 40.216 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 155, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  47.437 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-04-22T17:39:58-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

[x] Issues\r\n\r\n My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n#672 \r\n\r\n- [x] Description\r\n\r\n1. Non blocking lock. We will reserve the capability to extend to a blocking lock in the future, meaning that we could provide the boolean parameter in API for either nonblocking or blocking.\r\n2. Timeout support. The client need to input the timeout when it tries to acquire the lock. After timeout, if no other client tries to get the lock, the client can still keep the lock, if other client tries to acquire the lock, and finds the previous client already timeout, the previous client will be forced to release the lock.\r\n3. Lock message support. The client can input the reason for the lock (a string) when it tries to acquire the lock, and future lock operation, when fails, will get the message for the current lock. \r\n4. Java API support.\r\n5. No notification support. When a client loses its lock after timeout or during SRE maintenance work, there is no notification sent out to it.\r\n\r\n- [x] Tests\r\n\r\n The following tests are written for this issue:\r\nTestZKHelixNonblockingLock\r\n\r\n- [x] Commits\r\n\r\n My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFix one part of #939\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n - What\r\nTestCrushAutoRebalanceNonRack is flaky. It could fail because of dropping instance failure.\r\n```\r\n2020-04-13 01:01:32,366 [main] ERROR org.apache.helix.zookeeper.zkclient.ZkClient - Failed to delete /CLUSTER_TestCrushAutoRebalanceNonRack/INSTANCES/localhost_12921/MESSAGES\r\norg.apache.helix.zookeeper.zkclient.exception.ZkException: org.apache.zookeeper.KeeperException$NotEmptyException: KeeperErrorCode = Directory not empty for /CLUSTER_TestCrushAutoRebalanceNonRack/INSTANCES/localhost_12921/MESSAGES\r\n```\r\n- Why\r\n`ZkHelixAdmin.dropInstance()` has a retry. But in the log retry is not executed. The root cause is `ZkClient.deleteRecursively()` changes the throwing exception from HelixException to ZkClientException but `ZkHelixAdmin.dropInstance()` is still catching HelixException to retry. So ZkClientException is not caught and no retry to delete the path.\r\n- How\r\nTo fix this, we need to catch `ZkClientException` instead of `HelixException`. And to make ZkHelixAdmin backward compatible, we also need to convert `ZkClientException` to `HelixException` to be re-thrown.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nEnhance existing tests to verify the scenario when `ZkClientException` is thrown from ZkClient:\r\n - TestZkHelixAdmin.testZkHelixAdmin\r\n - TestZkBaseDataAccessor.testSyncRemove\r\n\r\nEnhance below to wait for the dropping instance to be offline:\r\n - TestCrushAutoRebalanceNonRack.testLackEnoughInstances\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO]\r\n[ERROR] Failures:\r\n[ERROR]   TestJobQueueCleanUp.testJobQueueAutoCleanUp » ThreadTimeout Method org.testng....\r\n[ERROR]   TestRebalanceRunningTask.testFixedTargetTaskAndDisabledRebalanceAndNodeAdded:265 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[ERROR]   TestRecurringJobQueue.testDeletingRecurrentQueueWithHistory:296 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[INFO]\r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1119, Failures: 3, Errors: 0, Skipped: 1\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD FAILURE\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:21 h\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-04-13T17:23:52-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nSKIPPED test:\r\nTestDelayedAutoRebalanceWithDisabledInstance.testDelayedPartitionMovement\r\n\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 8, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 46.486 s - in org.apache.helix.integration.rebalancer.DelayedAutoRebalancer.TestDelayedAutoRebalanceWithDisabledInstance\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 8, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  52.180 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-04-13T17:29:15-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 5, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 21.638 s - in org.apache.helix.integration.task.TestRebalanceRunningTask\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 5, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  27.661 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-04-13T17:31:55-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 6, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 164.283 s - in org.apache.helix.integration.task.TestRecurringJobQueue\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 6, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  02:50 min\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-04-13T17:35:16-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 3, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 13.051 s - in org.apache.helix.integration.task.TestJobQueueCleanUp\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 3, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  18.771 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-04-13T17:38:40-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nImplements #947 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n- What\r\nMetadatastore directory service(MSDS) provides routing functionality for requests to multi realm zookeeper servers. Java APIs talks to MSDS to fetch routing data when they are constructed.\r\n\r\n- Why\r\nTo make sure Helix Java API is connecting to the correct MSDS endpoint, we would like to add an integration test. This test verifies that each API only connects to the configured MSDS endpoint but not other endpoints.\r\n\r\n- How\r\n 1. Create 2 MSDS servers;\r\n 2. Create 2 instances of each Helix Java APIs: one is constructed with MSDS endpoint configured in system property, the other one is constructed with a RealmAwareZkConnectionConfig that has MSDS endpoint configured.\r\n 3. The Java API instances should only talk to its configured MSDS. Check the thrown exception when the instance is talking to an incorrect MSDS.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nTestMultiZkHelixJavaApis.testDifferentMsdsEndpointConfigs\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\nNo change in main code so no impact on other tests. Running this integration test is enough.\r\n\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 8, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 11.754 s - in org.apache.helix.integration.multizk.TestMultiZkHelixJavaApis\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 8, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  17.507 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-04-10T17:52:27-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\nIn current test we initialize routing table provider after updating customized state, and there are several re-initialization of routing table provider at different places during the test to set different data sources. Although routing table provider will fetch correct results in this way, it does not represent a common way how our customers should use routing table provider. This PR fixes this problem.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR moves the initialization of routing table provider to before class so it is initialized before any updates. In addition, in this PR re-initializations of routing table provider during the test are removed. Also, added several checks into the validation method to cover some edge cases. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n(List the names of added unit/integration tests)\r\n\r\n- [ ] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(Copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\")\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #767 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nZkBucketDataAccessor supports TTL-based garbage collection of stale versions. We create a thread pool for this of size 1, but the way the thread pool is created currently may not guarantee strictly sequential execution of GC timer tasks, which may cause unexpected GC behaviors. This commit uses Executors.newSingleThreadScheduledExecutor()to create the GC thread pool with a sequential execution guarantee.\r\n\r\nNote: another way to do this is to implement a Bounded event queue-based GC, but Java already provides this queue-based model in Executors interface - we want to try our best at avoid reinventing the wheel.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nTestWagedRebalancer, TestZkBucketDataAccessor, etc.\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\nhelix-core:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[ERROR] Failures: \r\n[ERROR]   TestRebalancePipeline.testMsgTriggeredRebalance:196 expected:<MASTER> but was:<SLAVE>\r\n[ERROR]   TestEnableCompression.testEnableCompressionResource:117 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1119, Failures: 2, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD FAILURE\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:12 h\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-04-10T12:03:37-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\nRunning the two failed tests:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 6, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 39.141 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 6, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR title:\r\nFixes #943 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nIn this PR, a new logic is added which targets the scenario where user\r\ndisables and enables specific CustomizedView types in the config. In this case, since the CustomizedView path for that type is removed by the controller, the router looses its\r\nlistener. In this commit, we added root change lister and re-registers the listeners again.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\nTest Result 1 (Helix-Core): mvn test\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO]\r\n[ERROR] Failures:\r\n[ERROR]   TestJobQueueCleanUp.testJobQueueAutoCleanUp » ThreadTimeout Method org.testng....\r\n[ERROR]   TestWorkflowTermination.testWorkflowRunningTimeout:131->verifyWorkflowCleanup:257 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[INFO]\r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 923, Failures: 2, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD FAILURE\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:05 h\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-04-09T18:25:01-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nTest Result 2 (Helix-Core): mvn test -Dtest=\"TestJobQueueCleanUp,TestWorkflowTermination\"\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 8, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 47.725 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 8, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  52.258 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-04-10T09:31:45-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nTest Result (Helix-REST):\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 97, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 27.546 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 97, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  32.660 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-04-10T09:29:13-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n#940 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis is a workaround fix to ensure backward compatibility. An additional cache map is used to keep the stable partition list so as to remove the randomness in the algorithm input.\r\nNote that the right fix would be cleaner that we sort the list inside the strategy class. However, that will also change all existing cluster assignments in production.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nTestResourceControllerDataProvider.testStablePartitionListCache\r\n* Note that integration test is not quite doable unless we have a way to let JDK keySet() method return the same set with different iteration orders. Please comment if any good idea.\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n[ERROR] Failures:\r\n[ERROR]   TestRebalancePipeline.testMsgTriggeredRebalance:208 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[ERROR] org.apache.helix.integration.rebalancer.CrushRebalancers.TestCrushAutoRebalanceTopoplogyAwareDisabled.testLackEnoughLiveInstances(org.apache.helix.integration.rebalancer.CrushRebalancers.TestCrushAutoRebalanceTopoplogyAwareDisabled)\r\n[ERROR]   Run 1: TestCrushAutoRebalanceTopoplogyAwareDisabled.testLackEnoughLiveInstances:79->TestCrushAutoRebalanceNonRack.testLackEnoughLiveInstances:228->TestCrushAutoRebalanceNonRack.validateIsolation:301 expected:<2> but was:<1>\r\n[INFO]   Run 2: PASS\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO]\r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1119, Failures: 2, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD FAILURE\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time: 01:14 h\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-04-10T16:17:10-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nRerun failed test\r\n\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 13, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 37.316 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 13, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time: 43.478 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-04-10T16:32:30-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #932\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the flaky tests in `TestResourceAccessor`, namely `testPartitionHealth` and `testResourceHealth`. The tests have been failing because the external views created during the tests could be sometimes removed before the health check, causing health checks to fail. How to reproduce: add time delay before health check calls will always fail the test cases. \r\n\r\nWe believe that the reason behind external view removal is due to the controllers, and disabling the controllers on the test clusters has made the tests pass even with the time delay. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTests run: 112, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 121.159 sec - in TestSuite\r\n\r\nResults :\r\n\r\nTests run: 112, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  02:04 min\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-04-08T13:54:02-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)","created_at":"2020-04-08T21:21:48Z","updated_at":"2020-04-16T22:14:19Z","closed_at":"2020-04-09T00:34:36Z","merged_at":"2020-04-09T00:34:35Z","merge_commit_sha":"66c99644da57286ee545a999078096a362184c08","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/935/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/935/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/935/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/677ce52e7e35fbbd6f115c357fd1233616407b27","head":{"label":"NealSun96:nealsun/fix-flaky-resource-accessor-tests","ref":"nealsun/fix-flaky-resource-accessor-tests","sha":"677ce52e7e35fbbd6f115c357fd1233616407b27","user":{"login":"NealSun96","id":18000949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDAwOTQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18000949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96","html_url":"https://github.com/NealSun96","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":233725825,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzM3MjU4MjU=","name":"helix","full_name":"NealSun96/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"NealSun96","id":18000949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDAwOTQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18000949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96","html_url":"https://github.com/NealSun96","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/NealSun96/helix","description":"Mirror

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n(#942  )\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the customized view cache update/delete operation in customized view aggregation stage. Previously, we depend on routing table provider to update customized view cache, as the controller is NOT listening to customized view change, and we found there're some cases we see inconsistency between cache and zk due to the lag between routing table provider and controller. To handle cache in the customized view aggregation stage could avoid such problems.\r\n\r\nDetailed race condition:\r\nAssume the customized state config changes, and it triggers a customized view update, before the router catches the change and processes the customized view change and updates cache, there's another customized state config change happen, in the customized view aggregation stage, we compare the new change with that in the cache, which is stale, and we will make the wrong decision.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(Copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\")\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #927 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the MetadataStoreDirectory routing data cache refresh bug. In `ZkMetadataStoreDirectory`, it is now ensured that routing data cache is cleared before updating; when an exception is raised, the old data is still erased correctly. \r\n\r\nAlso, this PR fixes an edge case during `TrieRoutingData` creation. When there are zkRealms defined without a single sharding key, `TrieRoutingData` now correctly identifies the raw routing data as invalid and raise an exception. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 145, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 7, Time elapsed: 28.895 s <<< FAILURE! - in TestSuite\r\n[ERROR] testResourceHealth(org.apache.helix.rest.server.TestResourceAccessor)  Time elapsed: 0.295 s  <<< FAILURE!\r\njava.lang.AssertionError: expected:<HEALTHY> but was:<UNHEALTHY>\r\n\tat org.apache.helix.rest.server.TestResourceAccessor.testResourceHealth(TestResourceAccessor.java:289)\r\n\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Failures: \r\n[ERROR]   TestResourceAccessor.testResourceHealth:289 expected:<HEALTHY> but was:<UNHEALTHY>\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 145, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 7\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD FAILURE\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  33.443 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-04-03T13:47:22-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\nThe failed test is known flaky and is tracked by https://github.com/apache/helix/issues/932. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)","created_at":"2020-04-07T16:29:22Z","updated_at":"2020-04-08T01:03:51Z","closed_at":"2020-04-08T01:03:51Z","merged_at":"2020-04-08T01:03:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"645ec57461ae6ecd7d6e21bbc90fa998229969ea","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/933/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/933/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/933/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/6b719c25a8cfe8abdb308ea744a32900464a9acc","head":{"label":"NealSun96:nealsun/MSD-routing-data-cache-refresh-bug","ref":"nealsun/MSD-routing-data-cache-refresh-bug","sha":"6b719c25a8cfe8abdb308ea744a32900464a9acc","user":{"login":"NealSun96","id":18000949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDAwOTQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18000949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96","html_url":"https://github.com/NealSun96","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":233725825,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzM3MjU4MjU=","name":"helix","full_name":"NealSun96/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"NealSun96","id":18000949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDAwOTQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18000949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96","html_url":"https://github.com/NealSun96","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NealSun96/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/NealSun96/helix","description":"Mirror

Issues\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR title:\r\nFixes #461\r\nFixes #922\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nThis commit specifically targets the scenario where there are multiple currentstates and previous assignment existed for one partition. In this case, since paMap has only one field for the mapping, the final result of scheduling is not deterministic. In this case, tasks can be stuck in INIT -> RUNNING and RUNNING -> DROPPED on the wrong instance. This PR fixes this scenario.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\nTestTargetedTaskStateChange\r\nTestTaskSchedulingTwoCurrentStates\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\nTest Result 1: mvn test\r\nFailed tests:\r\n  TestWorkflowTermination.testWorkflowPausedTimeout:170->verifyWorkflowCleanup:257 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n\r\nTests run: 1094, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD FAILURE\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:13 h\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-03-30T17:11:26-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe failed test has passed when I ran it individually.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2020-03-31T18:19:36Z","updated_at":"2020-07-24T17:43:41Z","closed_at":"2020-04-02T16:43:16Z","merged_at":"2020-04-02T16:43:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"184a50ac173c18e0ea3d40ffb5a0f93d31aa558f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/923/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/923/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/923/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/6df37e4e48c0ee66c9d1a54790c86124d2eb3e0f","head":{"label":"alirezazamani:two_current_states_one_paMap","ref":"two_current_states_one_paMap","sha":"6df37e4e48c0ee66c9d1a54790c86124d2eb3e0f","user":{"login":"alirezazamani","id":9290963,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTA5NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9290963?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezazamani","html_url":"https://github.com/alirezazamani","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezazamani/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezazamani/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezazamani/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezazamani/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezazamani/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezazamani/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezazamani/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezazamani/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezazamani/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":197044045,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTcwNDQwNDU=","name":"helix","full_name":"alirezazamani/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"alirezazamani","id":9290963,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTA5NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9290963?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezazamani","html_url":"https://github.com/alirezazamani","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezazamani/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezazamani/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezazamani/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezazamani/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezazamani/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezazamani/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezazamani/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezazamani/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alirezazamani/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/alirezazamani/helix","description":"Mirror

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #914 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nIt was observed that we need more fine-grained control over this multiZkEnabled config because there could exists namespaces with differing modes. Because multiple namespaces may be co-deployed, we cannot simply make it a system config.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nCovered by existing tests.\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n[ERROR] Failures: \r\n[ERROR]   TestResourceAccessor.testResourceHealth:289 expected:<HEALTHY> but was:<UNHEALTHY>\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 144, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 7\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD FAILURE\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  38.519 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-03-26T15:37:48-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-surefire-plugin:3.0.0-M3:test (default-test) on project helix-rest: There are test failures.\r\n\r\n\r\nKnown failure. This will be dealt with in a different PR.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nCurrently in ClusterAccessor, get/update ClusterConfig and RESTConfig methods share some common logics, and results in duplicated code. This PR is intended to reduce the duplicated code by taking out the logic and create a common method for both ClusterConfig and RESTConfig.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nA createConfig and a updateConfig method are created to be called in specific method. For example, createClusterConfig calls createConfig and pass in a parameter indicating this is for cluster config.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\nResults :\r\n\r\nTests run: 102, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  03:00 min\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-03-24T11:02:46-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines.

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #907 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nHelix REST needs to start using a realm-aware ZkClient on multi-zk mode. Also it needs to become a listener on routing data because we don't want to restart the HelixRestServer every time we update the routing data.\r\n\r\nChangelist:\r\n1. Make ServerContext listen on routing data paths if run on multi-zk mode\r\n2. Make HelixRestServer use RealmAwareZkClient (FederatedZkClient) on multi-zk mode\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nTestRoutingDataUpdate\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\non helix-rest module:\r\n\r\n> [INFO] Results:\r\n> [INFO] \r\n> [ERROR] Failures: \r\n> [ERROR]   TestResourceAccessor.testResourceHealth:289 expected:<HEALTHY> but was:<UNHEALTHY>\r\n> [INFO] \r\n> [ERROR] Tests run: 144, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 7\r\n> [INFO] \r\n> [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n> [INFO] BUILD FAILURE\r\n> [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n> [INFO] Total time:  37.847 s\r\n> [INFO] Finished at: 2020-03-23T22:02:47-07:00\r\n> [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nTestResourceAccessor is an unrelated failure that will be fixed in future iterations.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2020-03-24T05:03:27Z","updated_at":"2020-03-26T05:20:11Z","closed_at":"2020-03-26T05:20:11Z","merged_at":"2020-03-26T05:20:11Z","merge_commit_sha":"e473cec6f85c673f7d0e41cfad31f88aaf139355","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/908/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/908/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/908/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/a8ea3ecd636fb320214a88f34f84edac7c6d19de","head":{"label":"narendly:refresh-rest","ref":"refresh-rest","sha":"a8ea3ecd636fb320214a88f34f84edac7c6d19de","user":{"login":"narendly","id":10107095,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTA3MDk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10107095?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly","html_url":"https://github.com/narendly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":126890023,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjY4OTAwMjM=","name":"helix","full_name":"narendly/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"narendly","id":10107095,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTA3MDk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10107095?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly","html_url":"https://github.com/narendly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/narendly/helix","description":"Mirror

including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n3 issues were uncovered by the second round of MetadataStoreDirectory Service manual testing:\r\n1. `SetRoutingData` does not respect the return value of the underlying function. \r\n2. The port of each instance is not considered when forwarding requests, therefore failing all the forwarded requests.\r\n3. \"/admin/v2\" is not added when forwarding requests, therefore (would be) failing the forwarded requests. \r\nFixes: return 500 when false; add mechanism to read ports from system configs (just like hostname); add mechanism to read url prefixes from system configs (just like hostname).\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 143, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 7, Time elapsed: 26.41 s <<< FAILURE! - in TestSuite\r\n[ERROR] testResourceHealth(org.apache.helix.rest.server.TestResourceAccessor)  Time elapsed: 0.266 s  <<< FAILURE!\r\njava.lang.AssertionError: expected:<HEALTHY> but was:<UNHEALTHY>\r\n\tat org.apache.helix.rest.server.TestResourceAccessor.testResourceHealth(TestResourceAccessor.java:289)\r\n\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Failures: \r\n[ERROR]   TestResourceAccessor.testResourceHealth:289 expected:<HEALTHY> but was:<UNHEALTHY>\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 143, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 7\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nResolves #891 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR updates getClusters() in ZkHelixAdmin in realm-aware mode. It is difficult to reason about getting all clusters - and this method, on single-realm mode, is also broken anyways because in the case users create nested clusters, this method will end up returning nothing. This update is backward-compatible for single-realm users.\r\n\r\nIdeally, users should use Metadata Store Directory Service to get the list of all clusters.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/apache/helix/pull/892\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)","created_at":"2020-03-13T06:45:16Z","updated_at":"2020-03-14T00:28:02Z","closed_at":"2020-03-14T00:28:02Z","merged_at":"2020-03-14T00:28:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"10b56e6505cf5c76cc9be714de15121a844afd7f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/895/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/895/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/895/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/687d39b8ec03f420baa8b733602b89a81c7846a7","head":{"label":"narendly:zkHelixAdmin","ref":"zkHelixAdmin","sha":"687d39b8ec03f420baa8b733602b89a81c7846a7","user":{"login":"narendly","id":10107095,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTA3MDk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10107095?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly","html_url":"https://github.com/narendly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":126890023,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjY4OTAwMjM=","name":"helix","full_name":"narendly/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"narendly","id":10107095,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTA3MDk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10107095?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly","html_url":"https://github.com/narendly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/narendly/helix","description":"Mirror

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #891 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nBecause Helix Controller now uses WAGED rebalancer as the default rebalancer, it tries to create an instance of ZkBucketDataAccessor. This will fail unless ZkBucketDataAccessor was also made realm-aware. We can simply use a FederatedZkClient here since BucketDataAccessor does not support ephemeral operations.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/apache/helix/pull/892 for testing.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #772 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nWhen a single resource is scaled up or down, we noticed dramatic divergence between Baseline and Best possible assignments. We concluded initially that it could be caused by some unexpected randomness in the algorithm, and we found out this potential score-tie during node evaluation. This PR fixes a potential situation where two AssignableNodes will receive the same score; the fix makes the algorithm more deterministic. \r\n\r\nAfter further experiments and discussions, we realized that the divergence might be caused by Baseline recalculation after IdealState changes. See #772. This topic will be explored further in another issue. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nTestConstraintBasedAlgorithm.testCalculateScoreDeterminism\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n```\r\nFailed tests: \r\n  TestResourceChangeDetector.testRemoveInstance:284 Â» ZkClient Failed to delete ...\r\n  TestControllerLeadershipChange.testMissingTopStateDurationMonitoring:262 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n\r\nTests run: 1088, Failures: 2, Errors: 0, Skipped: 5\r\n\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD FAILURE\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:06 h\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-03-12T13:12:33-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\n(Rerun)\r\n```\r\nTests run: 14, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 36.204 sec - in TestSuite\r\n\r\nResults :\r\n\r\nTests run: 14, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  40.600 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-03-12T13:30:22-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n(#850 )\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nThis PR update some cache functions, including some participant cache changes and customized view cache change. The main reason for participant cache change is that we do not want to access ZK outside of resource data provider, because that would break the assumption of some of our tests. For customized view cache, the remove function is added for refresh purpose. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 909, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 3,438.097 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 909, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #879\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThe changes merged in https://github.com/apache/helix/pull/858 broke `testInstancesStoppable_zoneBased`. The test didn't create external views at all, which will encounter exceptions with the new logic. \r\nThe logic added wasn't supposed to break the tests because the logic is to perform null checks before an if condition that utilizes maps. However, the tests were passing because in the \"and\" if condition, it failed at `isPartitionMap.containsKey(instanceName)` without accessing the second part of the \"and\" condition. Therefore, even though the second part could cause a null pointer failure, it was never an issue. The fix is to reorder the logic such that the conditions are performed separately with null checks right before each map access. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\nTests run: 99, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 21.142 sec - in TestSuite\r\n\r\nResults :\r\n\r\nTests run: 99, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  25.069 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-03-09T20:25:23-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X ] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n(#875 )\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nHelix has a topology defined in cluster config, e.g., \"TOPOLOGY\": \"/zone/host\", and it will be used to construct the \"domain\" field in participant config, e.g. \"\"DOMAIN\": \"zone=0,host=host1\". In Azure, Helix will provide a default topology value for the cluster, and the format is /faultDomain/hostName. In this pR, we add the construction function in Participant manager to construct the domain field based on this topology.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X ] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [X ] My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #864 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nIt was observed that if build fails (if there is a test failure), then not all of the test goals are executed. There are currently two goals: default-test (single ZK) and multi-zk. If default-test has any test failures, we won't ever see multi-zk get executed, and this is a problem because we don't get to run the test suite in a multi-zk setup.\r\n\r\nThis config change is a workaround for this - we allow failing tests to be retried up to 3 times to make them pass. If they still fail, we will consider them as flaky tests and have to fix them moving forward.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nbuild without tests\r\n\r\n```\r\nINFO] Apache Helix .......................................

Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nCurrently the update customized state method is made synchronized for concurrency control.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #841, #842, #843 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR implements `setRoutingData`, which was an endpoint that was defined but not finished. It allows users to overwrite whatever routing data there is for a namespace and replace it with a new set of data. This endpoint was designed with convenience in mind because it allows users to specify the routing data in one call instead of making multiple calls to create zkrealms and add sharding keys. This endpoint was originally designed to validate the input but now it doesn't, please refer #842 for the reasoning. \r\n\r\nRelated to this PR, we also discovered that there are problems related to the construction of `TrieRoutingData` in `MetadataStoreDirectory`. Please see #841 . \r\n\r\nLastly, we are also fixing the race conditions of writing operations in `MetadataStoreDirectory` which are discovered during the development. Please see #843. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 140, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 24.602 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 140, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  53.115 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-03-02T14:38:49-08:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nResolves #839 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nTo make Helix Java APIs realm-aware, we first make ConfigAccessor and ZkUtil realm-aware by instrumenting these APIs with a Builder and RealmAwareZkClients.\r\n\r\nThe Builder pattern is chosen because it is a scalable option when there are a lot of configurable parameters. It makes it easy to validate the given parameters as well.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nConfigAccessor is already covered by TestConfigAccessor.\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO]\r\n[ERROR] Failures:\r\n[ERROR]   TestEnableCompression.testEnableCompressionResource:108 expected:<true> but was:<false>\r\n[INFO]\r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1083, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD FAILURE\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:08 h\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-02-29T20:46:35-08:00\r\n\r\n\r\nTestCompression passes when run individually\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)","created_at":"2020-02-29T03:55:01Z","updated_at":"2020-03-03T04:48:11Z","closed_at":"2020-03-03T04:48:10Z","merged_at":"2020-03-03T04:48:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"08f5ec7ec88eb8db95cf63c89d6062a4d19c31f1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/838/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/838/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/838/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/59b39dd50cd8e786ea514156a7666f5c7e6f9507","head":{"label":"narendly:clusterSetup","ref":"clusterSetup","sha":"59b39dd50cd8e786ea514156a7666f5c7e6f9507","user":{"login":"narendly","id":10107095,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTA3MDk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10107095?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly","html_url":"https://github.com/narendly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":126890023,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjY4OTAwMjM=","name":"helix","full_name":"narendly/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"narendly","id":10107095,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTA3MDk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10107095?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly","html_url":"https://github.com/narendly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narendly/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/narendly/helix","description":"Mirror

To reduce the duplication of code, separate the related code section out and put into individual methods. \r\nCondition: current state = null, desired state = dropped, there is pending message. Current state is checked, and since it is null, it is set to the initial state OFFLINE for further handling. \r\nBefore fix: all message generation logics are skipped for this instance, this handling is to fix a previous problem where under this condition, infinite \"OFFLINE to DROPPED\" state transition messages. And we are having the problem that because we skip the message generation logics, the cancellation message for the pending message won't be generated.\r\nAfter fix: this fix separated the generation of cancellation message for pending message from other message generation logics to be a single method, and call this method when the above edge case is met.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nTestSendCancellationMessageFromOFFLINEToDROPPED\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\nResults :\r\n\r\nTests run: 1084, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:09 h\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-03-02T11:16:06-08:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #828, #832 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the following bugs:\r\n1. When the routing data is not initialized for a namespace, creating a `ZkRoutingDataReader` for that namespace causes a NoNodeException due to a `getChildren` call. Fix: initialize the base node for routing data across all zookeeper-related actors (`ZkMetadataStoreDirectory`, `ZkRoutingDataReader`, `ZkRoutingDataWriter`)\r\n2. In the `getRoutingData()` method of `ZkRoutingDataReader`, a null check is necessary before getting sharding keys from a realm node, because the realm node may be an invalid ZNRecord. Fix: add null check. \r\n3. The hostname provided from system properties does not have the protocol. `ZkRoutingDataWriter` was using the hostname directly for request forwarding. Fix: add protocol to the hostname before request forwarding. \r\n4. `ZkRoutingDataReader`'s `handleDataDeleted` is missing an unsubscribe operation which may lead to watcher leak; `handleChildChange` is missing the resubscription operation. Fix: add both.\r\n\r\nThis PR also introduced an improvement to `MetadataStoreDirectoryAccessor` endpoints. Previously, the endpoints in `MetadataStoreDirectoryAccessor` are missing proper status codes for some cases: for example for `IllegalArgumentException`, it's most fitting to return 400 Bad Request to users, but currently the exception will not be handled and cause a 500 to be returned. \r\nA change that can fix this issue while improving the status code behavior is to bind exception types with status codes. `NoSuchElementException` should be paired with 404, `IllegalArgumentException` should be paired with 400, while `IllegalStateException` (currently used when underlying ZkClients are closed) should be paired with 500. This has two major benefits:\r\n1. Code maintenance is made easier. The exception types clearly and meaningfully translate to status codes. Developers no longer need to traverse layer by layer to figure out what happened to each exception; all of them are handled at the accessor layer.\r\n2. The status codes are verbose and helpful, because they now contain the underlying exception messages that explain the exact reason behind the exceptions. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 136, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 22.201 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 136, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  52.954 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-02-27T12:06:15-08:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #820 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to fix the `InvalidRoutingDataException` error message that shows up in tests. The source of this error was due to two test cases in `TestZkMetadataStoreDirectory`, in which both of the test cases inserted \"/a/b/c/d/e\" directly into the same set of routing data. This renders the routing data invalid because one sharding key is pointing to two realms. \r\nThis was not caught at insertion because the insertion was done directly instead of through a dedicated API (because the code in question is a test case). The tests didn't fail because they relied on the raw routing data for correctness. The construction of `MetadataStoreRoutingData` failed \"correctly\" as can be seen from the error messages, however the construction failure was after raw routing data being fetched, therefore making the situation undetected. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 128, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 21.796 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 128, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  48.357 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-02-26T16:33:30-08:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #818 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nWe want all implementations of RealmAwareZkClient to do a one-time query to Metadata Store Directory Service for routing data and cache it in memory. In order to accomplish that, we have introduced HttpRoutingDataReader, which is a Singleton class that makes a REST call to read routing data and caches it in memory. This diff updates the initialization logic in RealmAwareZkClients accordingly.\r\nChangelist:\r\n1. Update all RealmAwareZkClient initialization logic\r\n2. Fix tests\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nTestDedicatedZkClient\r\nTestSharedZkClient\r\nTestFederatedZkClient\r\n\r\n- [x] The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n- metadata-store-directory-common\r\n\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 30, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 0.322 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 30, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  4.531 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-03-03T18:02:00-08:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n- zookeeper-api\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 18, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 1.57 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 18, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  7.604 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2020-03-03T18:02:21-08:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n- helix-rest\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 136, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 25.661 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 136, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] \r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines.
