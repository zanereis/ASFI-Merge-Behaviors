What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nMetadata Index feature needs to uniquely identify Hudi table column, partition\r\nand files from their names. Need an utility to generate unique hash ids for any\r\ngiven string or byte array messages\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Adding a new utility class HashID to generate 32,64,128 bits hashes for any\r\n  given message of string or byte array type. This class internally uses\r\n  MessageDigest and xxhash libraries.\r\n\r\n- Adding stateful hash holders for Hudi table columns, partition and files to\r\n  pass around for metaindex and to convert to base64encoded strings whenever\r\n  needed\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis pull request is a trivial rework / code cleanup

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nIn order to support better out-of-box clustering configs, we need to have better default values for those configs. Most of them already have a good default value, this PR changes defaut for two configs: \r\n- Clustering plan strategy class: The previously set default value made certain assumptions on the partition path like it should be day-based partition. The new default is purely file size based. \r\n- Enable commit metadata preservation: Previously, it was disabled by default. Enanling it by default will be useful for incremental query support with replace commits in the timeline.\r\n\r\nOn ease of use: \r\n\r\nNow user only need to enable clustering. That's it! Though it is advisable to set sort columns to cluster by to make use of the default clustering execution strategy. \r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title &

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nMetadata Table Bootstrap for very large tables (1200+ partitions, 10Million+ files) does not complete in a reasonable amount of time or leads to OOM on the Spark driver node even with 16GB memory.\r\nThis patch tries to fix the scale issue for bootstrapping very large datasets.\r\n \r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nFollowing improvements are implemented:\r\n1. Memory overhead reduction:\r\n  - Existing code caches FileStatus for each file in memory.\r\n  - Created a new class DirectoryInfo which is used to cache a director's file list with parts of the FileStatus (only filename and file len). This reduces the memory requirements.\r\n\r\n2. Improved parallelism:\r\n  - Existing code collects all the listing to the Driver and then creates HoodieRecord on the Driver.\r\n  - This takes a long time for large tables (11million HoodieRecords to be created)\r\n  - Created a new function in SparkRDDWriteClient specifically for bootstrap commit. In it, the HoodieRecord creation is parallelized across executors so it completes fast.\r\n\r\n3. Fixed setting to limit the number of parallel listings:\r\n  - Existing code had a bug wherein 1500 executors were hardcoded to perform listing. This leads to exception due to limit in the spark's result memory.\r\n  - Corrected the use of the config.\r\n\r\nResult:\r\nDataset has 1299 partitions and 12Million files.\r\nfile listing time=1.5mins\r\nHoodieRecord creation time=13seconds\r\ndeltacommit duration=2.6mins\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request is already covered by existing tests for Hoodie

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nIf clustering fails due to some reason, it leaves the unfinished replace commit in the timeline. During ingestion, if there are updates to a filegroup that was pending clustering and the update handling strategy is `SparkRejectUpdateStrategy`, then ingestion fails. If we use `SparkAllowUpdateStrategy` without rolling back the pending clustering then some updates may be lost. This PR fixes the issue by rolling back the pending clutering and allowing the updates to go through. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Changed the API to `handleUpdate` to return not only the records RDD but also the set of file groups receiving updates while pending clustering.\r\n  - `SparkRejectUpdateStrategy` still throws the error. `SparkAllowUpdateStrategy` will return a non-empty set.\r\n  - `BaseSparkCommitActionExecutor#clusteringHandleUpdate` will rollback pending clustering in case of non-empty set.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n  - Added a test in `TestHoodieClientOnCopyOnWriteStorage` to verify the change.\r\n  - Manually verified the change by interrupting a clustering job to produce unfinished commit and then doing an upsert.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n       \r\n - [ ] For large changes, please consider breaking it into sub-tasks under an umbrella

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the functionality of clustering and compaction in Kafka Connect Sink for Hudi.  To achieve that, the compaction and clustering logic are hooked up to Java client.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n - For compaction, the scheduling and execution are hooked up in `HoodieJavaMergeOnReadTable`, and interfaces in `HoodieCompactionHandler` are implemented in `HoodieJavaCopyOnWriteTable` to support compaction logic. `HoodieJavaMergeOnReadTableCompactor` is added for Java client as a plugin.   The validation of inflight instants is disabled for Kafka Connect.\r\n - For clustering, different clustering plan and execution strategies are added for Java client.  `JavaClusteringPlanActionExecutor` and `JavaExecuteClusteringCommitActionExecutor` are added, which are used in `HoodieJavaCopyOnWriteTable` to hook up clustering logic in Java client.\r\n - Note that compaction and clustering should not be executed inline in Hudi Kafka Connect Sink.\r\n - When ending the commit in a Hudi Kafka Connect transaction, schedules the compaction and clustering as needed.  The execution of scheduled compaction and clustering does not happen in the Sink.\r\n - Regarding the configuration:\r\n   - `hoodie.kafka.compaction.async.enable`: controls whether the async compaction is scheduled.  Default is `true`.\r\n   - `hoodie.clustering.async.enabled`: controls whether the async clustering is scheduled.  Default is `false`.\r\n - Explicitly disables metadata table using `\"hoodie.metadata.enable\": \"false\"` in `config-sink.json` since the metadata table functionality needs to be validated for Java client.\r\n - Updates README.md with the instructions of running async compaction and clustering.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nI run the end-to-end tests of Hudi Kafka Connect Sink to generate deltacommits in MOR table, which also schedules compaction and clustering.  Then running the async compaction and clustering using the following commands succeeds:\r\nCompaction:\r\n```\r\nspark-submit  \\\r\n--class org.apache.hudi.utilities.HoodieCompactor

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\n  When HoodieBackedTableMetadataWriter is instantiated for a writer client, it checks if\r\n  bootstrapping is needed for the table for any un-synced instants. When the writer initiates\r\n  a rollback action after the first commit (the one and only commit so far), the metadata table\r\n  writer instantiation assumes bootstrapping is needed for the table as it fails to find its latest\r\n  committed instant missing in the data table. And, while performing the bootstrapping it finds\r\n  a pending action in the data table timeline and so fails the operation and the errors bubbles\r\n  back to the writer client for the rollback action. The pending action for the data table is infact\r\n  the rollback action which the writer is attempting to do.Â \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  Fix is to make Metadata table writer creation aware of the currently inflight action so that it can\r\n  make some informed decision about whether bootstrapping is needed for the table and whether\r\n  any pending action on the data timeline can be ignored.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n  TestHBaseIndex::testEnsureTagLocationUsesCommitTimeline and ::testSimpleTagLocationAndUpdateWithRollback\r\n  is updated to include metadata table.\r\n\r\n  New test case TestHoodieBackedMetadata::testFirstCommitRollback has been added to verify the fix\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title &

purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nMetadata table is bootstrapped in the SparkRDDWriteClient constructor. Check for the upgrade/downgrade is performed during the operation when the HoodieTable object is created.\r\n\r\nIf the dataset is upgraded to new version, the metadata table will be deleted. The bootstrap of the metadata table in the constructor will be a waste.\r\n\r\nHence, we should bootstrap only if an upgrade / downgrade is not required on the dataset.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes double bootstrap of metadata table.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nCheck if upgrade/downgrade is required before bootstrapping metadata table.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new clustering strategy to support records staying in the same file id after clustering. Default strategy is to create new files after clustering. The new strategy is helpful for certain external index where we cannot change record location.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* Added a new clustering plan strategy which ensures that only single file group is created per clustering group while scheduling.\r\n* Added a new execution strategy which sorts based on columns irrespective of output file size using `HoodieUnboundedCreateHandle`.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n  - Added a unti test in `TestHoodieClientOnCopyOnWriteStorage` to verify the change.\r\n  - Manually verified the change by running inline clustering locally.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n       \r\n - [ ] For large changes, please consider breaking it into sub-tasks under an umbrella JIRA.\r\n","created_at":"2021-10-20T13:29:26Z","updated_at":"2021-12-23T06:45:16Z","closed_at":"2021-11-10T04:17:50Z","merged_at":"2021-11-10T04:17:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"bb6a19e7d71a91f23e17bf2fe5dcb8ecf4affde2","assignee":{"login":"satishkotha","id":2992755,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTI3NTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2992755?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishkotha","html_url":"https://github.com/satishkotha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishkotha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishkotha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishkotha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishkotha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishkotha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishkotha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishkotha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishkotha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishkotha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"satishkotha","id":2992755,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTI3NTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2992755?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishkotha","html_url":"https://github.com/satishkotha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishkotha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishkotha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishkotha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishkotha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishkotha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishkotha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishkotha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishkotha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/satishkotha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2610270804,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjEwMjcwODA0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/priority:blocker","name":"priority:blocker","color":"78FA72","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/3833/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/3833/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/3833/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/statuses/1be91973111002baefadb0ea3009a52db2795521","head":{"label":"codope:hudi-1877-reusefileid","ref":"hudi-1877-reusefileid","sha":"1be91973111002baefadb0ea3009a52db2795521","user":{"login":"codope","id":16440354,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQwMzU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16440354?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope","html_url":"https://github.com/codope","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":357429656,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTc0Mjk2NTY=","name":"hudi","full_name":"codope/hudi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"codope","id":16440354,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQwMzU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16440354?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope","html_url":"https://github.com/codope","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\n- With recent [refactoring for synchronous metadata](https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/3590) patch, there was 2 code paths where double locking is happening. This patch fixes this issue. \r\n- While adding tests, also found a bug related to multi-writer and upgrade and fixed the same as well. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- There are two code paths where deadlock happens. \r\na. When a table is being upgraded, and if multi-writer is enabled, we rollback all partial commits. This upgrade step itself happens within a lock, but the rollback also tries to acquire lock when committing the rollback\r\nb. When auto commit is enabled with inline cleaning, auto clean is triggered as part of post commit which happens within a lock. But cleaning at the end when trying to commit again tries to acquire lock. \r\nFix: Added optionality to both rollback and clean to skip locking. These two code paths will set true for skipLocking. Also, fixed to add guards to take locks only if metadata is enabled. Prior to this patch, we take locks and then check if metadata writer is available. Some minor optimization. \r\n- While testing, came across a bug with upgrade and rollback relating to multi-writer. When a table needs an upgrade, and if multi-writer is enabled, we rollback all partial commits. This also rollsback the current transaction in flight. Added a filtering to ensure we don't rollback the current transaction that just got started and is triggering the upgrade. \r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n- Added tests to TestHoodieBackedMetadata\r\n   a. testMultiWriterForDoubleLocking\r\n   b. testRollbackDuringUpgradeForDoubleLocking\r\n\r\nPoints to discuss:\r\n- I checked code paths for inline compaction and clustering and it happens just [outside of transactional lock](https://github.com/apache/hudi/blob/46f0496a0838431cd8886ca882a902d801c4dfb8/hudi-client/hudi-client-common/src/main/java/org/apache/hudi/client/AbstractHoodieWriteClient.java#L202) in AbstractHoodieWriteClient. But [cleaning happens within transactional lock ](https://github.com/apache/hudi/blob/46f0496a0838431cd8886ca882a902d801c4dfb8/hudi-client/hudi-client-common/src/main/java/org/apache/hudi/client/AbstractHoodieWriteClient.java#L193)meant for inflight commit. Is that intentional or should we also move clean outside of the lock. \r\n- Two different code paths for auto commit enabled and disabled is slowly becoming a pain point.

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nIn order to support multiple writers against a single table we need to eliminate (or at least greatly reduce) the chance that multiple writers running in parallel will create instants using the same instant ID (it is currently based on the current time down to second granularity).\r\n\r\nThe current strategy has a shockingly high rate of instant time collisions even with just two writers. In order to make collisions far less likely this PR adds millisecond granularity to the instant timestamp. It is worth noting that this does not guarantee a collision-free solution so we also include steps to reconcile state in case it does happen. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *Modified HoodieActiveTimeline.COMMIT_FORMATTER to add milliseconds*\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n* Ran and verified existing unit tests around timeline operations\r\n* Added unit tests to verify that previous expectations around instant date math still hold true\r\n* Manually tested multiple writers which created hundreds of collision-free timeline entries\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [x] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [x] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nWe can specify different values to URL_ENCODE_PARTITIONING and HIVE_STYLE_PARTITIONING_ENABLE configs for multiple write operation without any warns or errors. And some partition path enable hive-style and some not, or some enable url-encode and some not, that is so weird.\r\n\r\nSo i wanna to persist these config to hoodie.properties when the first write (write data by spark dataframe the first time or create table by spark-sql). And then, uses do not need to specify these config any more. If these configs are specified and different to the existing value in hoodie.properties, exceptions will be raised. \r\n\r\nAnd, this is also useful to solve some of the keyGenerator discrepancy issues between DataFrame writer and SQL.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *Modify AnnotationLocation checkstyle rule in checkstyle.xml*\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\nIn order to support multi-writer concurrency where one writer is the Deltastreamer, other writers must copy any checkpoint state from previous commits into their current one in order to prevent interleaved commits from crashing the deltastreamer. \r\n\r\nThe code that does this did the following (before this change):\r\n* Get all the keys for the *current* inflight commit metadata\r\n* Filter out any keys that are not specified in the metadata config (a list of keys to replace)\r\n* For keys that exist in the current metadata, pull the data for that key from the *previous* commit and replace the current commit's metadata property value with that value\r\n\r\nThis does not work because a non-deltastreamer writer (such as a spark datasource writer) will never have the checkpoint key specified in its commit metadata (`deltastreamer.checkpoint.key`) which results in a commit in the timeline that does not have checkpoint state. If the deltastreamer tries to start from that commit it will fail.\r\n\r\nThis fixes that by changing the keyset that is filtered from the current commit to the previous commit. This fixes two issues:\r\n1. Checkpoint state is copied over from a previous commit which was made by the deltastreamer\r\n2. If the deltastreamer process fails or is stopped for a prolonged period of time, the non-deltastreamer writers will continue to carry over the checkpoint state which will allow the deltastreamer to correctly start from its last known position\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n- Added new config `hoodie.write.concurrency.merge.deltastreamer.state` which users can set to true with spark writer to enable multi writer across deltastreamer and spark writer. \r\n  - *Modify `TransactionUtils::overrideWithLatestCommitMetadata` to pull the keys from the last commit instead of the current commit*\r\n  - Removed the now unused, ambiguous metadata key config (`hoodie.write.meta.key.prefixes`)\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nManually verified the change by running multiple writers against the same table\r\n* Writer One: Deltastreamer, kafka source\r\n* Writer Two:  Spark datasource, event data from existing hudi table\r\n* Verified zero errors from deltastreamer over hundreds of interleaved commits\r\n* Shut down deltastreamer for a prolonged period, then verified that I could start it back up without losing its position in kafka (checkpoint state in tact on recent commits)\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [x] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [x] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [x] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ x]

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nInetAddress.getLocalHost() can take up as much as 30+seconds if the network\r\nconfigurations are not done right.

just the 2nd commit. 1st commit is https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/3762\r\n\r\n- Adding parquet data block with inline read support. \r\n- Added a config `hoodie.table.log.block.type` to determine the log block type. If not set, we will fallback to determining log block type based on base file format. if set, we will use the config value. \r\n- Added some minimal tests to ensure adding a parquet data block and reading it using AbstractLogRecordScanner works fine. \r\n\r\nPending items:\r\n- where to store the configs for new parquet data block. we need index configs, and parquet write configs too. Don't think we can reuse existing ones its purpose is different. \r\n- Once have consensus, will have to fix the configs for the same. \r\n- Add more end to end tests to test parquet data blocks.

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\n- Added support to read HFile log blocks via inline FileSystem in metadata table.\r\n- Also added support to read for a list of keys(batch get) rather than full scan in metadata table. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n- Added two new configs to HoodieMetadataConfig. `hoodie.metadata.enable.inline.reading.log.files` and `hoodie.metadata.enable.full.scan.log.files`. \r\n- Since we are adding support for seek based read, renamed AbstractHoodieLogRecordScanner to AbstractHoodieLogRecordReader. and so have renamed HoodieMetadataMergedLogRecordReader. \r\n- Added new method to HoodieMetadataMergedLogRecordReader to support this purpose(i.e. reading records for a list of keys) w/o doing full scan. \r\n```\r\npublic List<Pair<String, Option<HoodieRecord<HoodieMetadataPayload>>>> getRecordsByKeys(List<String> keys) {\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n- Added new method to HoodieDataBlock for the new requirement. Base class does not have any impl. HoodieHFileDataBlock overrides and gives a concrete impl where in records are read via inline FileSystem with seek based approach. \r\n```\r\npublic List<IndexedRecord> getRecords(List<String> keys) throws IOException {\r\n}\r\n```\r\n- HoodieDataBlock also adheres to enableInline config even if not for batch get. Basically 3 options are possible. a: full scan w/o inline. b. full scan with inlining. c. batch get (with inline) \r\n- Have fixed BaseTableMetadata.getAllFilesInPartitions(List<String> partitions) to use batch get api rather than N single calls to getAllFilesInPartition(Path partitionPath). \r\n- have fixed metadata reader (HoodieBackedTableMetadata) to leverage the new apis based on config values. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - Added tests to TestHoodieRealtimeRecordReader to verify the change.\r\n  - Found some gaps in testing HFileWriter and Reader especially around seek based read and have added TestHoodieHFileReaderWriter to test these cases. \r\n  - Enabled inline and batch get reads to 1 test in TestHoodieBackedMetadata. \r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n       \r\n - [ ] For large changes, please consider breaking it into sub-tasks under an umbrella JIRA.\r\n","created_at":"2021-10-08T01:34:26Z","updated_at":"2021-11-25T07:59:13Z","closed_at":"2021-10-29T16:12:45Z","merged_at":"2021-10-29T16:12:45Z","merge_commit_sha":"69ee790a47a5fa90a6acd954a9330cce3ae31c3b","assignee":{"login":"vinothchandar","id":1179324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzkzMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1179324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar","html_url":"https://github.com/vinothchandar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"vinothchandar","id":1179324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzkzMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1179324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar","html_url":"https://github.com/vinothchandar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2610270804,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjEwMjcwODA0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/priority:blocker","name":"priority:blocker","color":"78FA72","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/3762/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/3762/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/3762/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/statuses/2b369a695c04138759613ab0acc03eec24484c47","head":{"label":"nsivabalan:inlineMetadataLogReader","ref":"inlineMetadataLogReader","sha":"2b369a695c04138759613ab0acc03eec24484c47","user":{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":159547623,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTk1NDc2MjM=","name":"hudi","full_name":"nsivabalan/hudi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","re

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\n- Fixing a direct fs calls. \r\n    - a. HoodieLogFileReader was using fs.getFileStatus on log file path. Fixed to avoid direct fs call\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- when reverse reading is enabled in HoodieLogFileReader, we do fs.getFileStatus().getLen to know the file length. but if we triage the call, one of the callers actually fetches the log paths from fileSlice and sets it in RealTimeSplit as List<String> for deltaLogPaths. Have added a new methods in RealTimeSplit called deltaLogFileStatus() and this particular caller will leverage the same to re-use the fileStatus and fetch the length as well. \r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis pull request is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis pull request is
