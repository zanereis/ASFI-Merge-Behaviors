What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is a sub-task of [SPARK-33138](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-33138). In order to make SQLConf.get reliable and stable, we need to make sure user can't pollute the SQLConf and SparkSession Context via calling setActiveSession and clearActiveSession.\r\n\r\nChange of the PR:\r\n\r\n* add legacy config spark.sql.legacy.allowModifyActiveSession to fallback to old behavior if user do need to call these two API.\r\n* by default, if user call these two API, it will throw exception\r\n* add extra two internal and private API setActiveSessionInternal and clearActiveSessionInternal for current internal usage\r\n* change all internal reference to new internal API except for SQLContext.setActive and SQLContext.clearActive\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nMake SQLConf.get reliable and stable.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n* Add UT in SparkSessionBuilderSuite to test the legacy config\r\n* Existing test\r\n","created_at":"2020-10-15T01:54:37Z","updated_at":"2020-11-13T08:02:20Z","closed_at":"2020-10-16T06:05:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"41566da1c86ecd93dba055d6655ad49184273d2d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30042/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30042/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30042/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/aa7bf5b50c4388e6caa24826d1bc83572af60e5a","head":{"label":"leanken-zz:leanken-SPARK-33139","ref":"leanken-SPARK-33139","sha":"aa7bf5b50c4388e6caa24826d1bc83572af60e5a","user":{"login":"leanken-zz","id":17242071,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjQyMDcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17242071?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leanken-zz","html_url":"https://github.com/leanken-zz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leanken-zz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leanken-zz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leanken-zz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leanken-zz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leanken-zz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leanken-zz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leanken-zz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leanken-zz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leanken-zz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":191892121,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTE4OTIxMjE=","name":"spark","full_name":"leanken-zz/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"leanken-zz","id":17242071,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjQyMDcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17242071?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leanken-zz","html_url":"https://github.com/leanken-zz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leanken-zz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leanken-zz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leanken-zz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leanken-zz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leanken-zz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leanken-zz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leanken-zz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leanken-zz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leanken-zz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/leanken-zz/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdds an additional check for non-fatal errors when attempting to add a new entry to the history server application listing.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nA bad rolling event log folder (missing appstatus file or no log files) would cause no applications to be loaded by the Spark history server. Figuring out why invalid event log folders are created in the first place will be addressed in separate issues, this just lets the history server skip the invalid folder and successfully load all the valid applications.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nNew

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAvoid distribute user jar from driver in yarn client mode.\r\nAdd the user's jar to `--jars`, this can be automatically uploaded to `spark.yarn.stagingDir`, usually hdfs.\r\nDownload user jar from stagingDir when executor is initialized.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhen the number of applied executors is large and the jar size is large, the executor pulls the jar from the driver, and the driver network traffic is high, and a timeout may occur. The driver and the executor of the yarn cluster may not be in the same data center.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nexist

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to fix a bug on calling `DataType.equalsIgnoreCompatibleNullability` with mistakenly swapped parameters in `V2WriteCommand.outputResolved`. The order of parameters for `DataType.equalsIgnoreCompatibleNullability` are `from` and `to`, which says that the right order of matching variables are `inAttr` and `outAttr`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSpark throws AnalysisException due to unresolved operator in v2 write, while the operator is unresolved due to a bug that parameters to call `DataType.equalsIgnoreCompatibleNullability` in `outputResolved` have been swapped.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, end users no longer suffer on unresolved operator in v2 write if they're trying to write dataframe containing non-nullable complex types against table matching complex types as nullable.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew UT

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to restrict the partial result feature only by root JSON objects. JSON datasource as well as `from_json()` will return `null` for malformed nested JSON objects.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. To not raise exception to users in the PERMISSIVE mode\r\n2. To fix a regression and to have the same behavior as Spark 2.4.x has\r\n3. Current implementation of partial result is supposed to work only for root (top-level) JSON objects, and not tested for bad nested complex JSON fields.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. Before the changes, the code below:\r\n```scala\r\n    val pokerhand_raw = Seq(\"\"\"[{\"cards\": [19], \"playerId\": 123456}]\"\"\").toDF(\"events\")\r\n    val event = new StructType().add(\"playerId\", LongType).add(\"cards\", ArrayType(new StructType().add(\"id\", LongType).add(\"rank\", StringType)))\r\n    val pokerhand_events = pokerhand_raw.select(from_json($\"events\", ArrayType(event)).as(\"event\"))\r\n    pokerhand_events.show\r\n```\r\nthrows the exception even in the default **PERMISSIVE** mode:\r\n```java\r\njava.lang.ClassCastException: java.lang.Long cannot be cast to org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.util.ArrayData\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.BaseGenericInternalRow.getArray(rows.scala:48)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.BaseGenericInternalRow.getArray$(rows.scala:48)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.GenericInternalRow.getArray(rows.scala:195)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter the changes:\r\n```\r\n+-----+\r\n|event|\r\n+-----+\r\n| null|\r\n+-----+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded a test to

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to restrict the partial result feature only by root JSON objects. JSON datasource as well as `from_json()` will return `null` for malformed nested JSON objects.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. To not raise exception to users in the PERMISSIVE mode\r\n2. To fix a regression and to have the same behavior as Spark 2.4.x has\r\n3. Current implementation of partial result is supposed to work only for root (top-level) JSON objects, and not tested for bad nested complex JSON fields.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. Before the changes, the code below:\r\n```scala\r\n    val pokerhand_raw = Seq(\"\"\"[{\"cards\": [19], \"playerId\": 123456}]\"\"\").toDF(\"events\")\r\n    val event = new StructType().add(\"playerId\", LongType).add(\"cards\", ArrayType(new StructType().add(\"id\", LongType).add(\"rank\", StringType)))\r\n    val pokerhand_events = pokerhand_raw.select(from_json($\"events\", ArrayType(event)).as(\"event\"))\r\n    pokerhand_events.show\r\n```\r\nthrows the exception even in the default **PERMISSIVE** mode:\r\n```java\r\njava.lang.ClassCastException: java.lang.Long cannot be cast to org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.util.ArrayData\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.BaseGenericInternalRow.getArray(rows.scala:48)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.BaseGenericInternalRow.getArray$(rows.scala:48)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.GenericInternalRow.getArray(rows.scala:195)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter the changes:\r\n```\r\n+-----+\r\n|event|\r\n+-----+\r\n| null|\r\n+-----+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded a test to

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nPostgres and MSSQL connection providers are not able to get custom `appEntry` because under some circumstances the driver is wrapped with `DriverWrapper`. Such case is not handled in the mentioned providers. In this PR I've added this edge case handling by passing unwrapped `Driver` from `JdbcUtils`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n`DriverWrapper` is not considered.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting + additional unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe current `Lead`/`Lag` extends `OffsetWindowFunction`. `OffsetWindowFunction` contains field `direction` and use `direction` to calculates the `boundary`.\r\n\r\nWe can use single literal expression unify the two properties.\r\nFor example:\r\n3 means `direction` is Asc and `boundary` is 3.\r\n-3 means `direction` is Desc and `boundary` is -3.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nImprove the current implement of `Lead`/`Lag`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n 'No'.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nJenkins test.\r\n","created_at":"2020-10-13T08:20:28Z","updated_at":"2020-10-16T13:34:09Z","closed_at":"2020-10-16T11:12:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6dcf9e51e9188716bd2ea98d086c9946b618fdac","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30023/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30023/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30023/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/07b3a926a5b3ad69b11425fef5fd131382bb1ab4","head":{"label":"beliefer:SPARK-33126","ref":"SPARK-33126","sha":"07b3a926a5b3ad69b11425fef5fd131382bb1ab4","user":{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":237617513,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzc2MTc1MTM=","name":"spark","full_name":"beliefer/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer/spark","description":"Apache

* Compatible with Hadoop > 3.2.0\r\n * Future proof for a while\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nUpgrade the Google Guava dependency for compatibility with Hadoop 3.2.1 and Hadoop 3.3.0. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSpark fails at runtime with NoSuchMethodExceptions when built/run in conjunction with these versions, which make use of com.google.common.base.Preconditions methods that are not present in the version of Guava currently specified for Spark.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nThis change introduces new dependencies into the build which are imported by the guava pom file.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nWe are currently running ETL production processes using Spark builds with this Guava version (based on the 3.0.1 tag).\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2020-10-13T04:42:30Z","updated_at":"2021-04-25T00:19:36Z","closed_at":"2021-04-25T00:19:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"da69c7bc7ea0ad4bf2c9558dd16349581aee0ab5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30022/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30022/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30022/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3ff577eedb70a594ff2d54fd99f0495b7e07a6df","head":{"label":"sfcoy:spark-33090-guava-upgrade","ref":"spark-33090-guava-upgrade","sha":"3ff577eedb70a594ff2d54fd99f0495b7e07a6df","user":{"login":"sfcoy","id":1232218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzIyMTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1232218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfcoy","html_url":"https://github.com/sfcoy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfcoy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfcoy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfcoy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfcoy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfcoy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfcoy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfcoy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfcoy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfcoy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":303257263,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMDMyNTcyNjM=","name":"spark","full_name":"sfcoy/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sfcoy","id":1232218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzIyMTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1232218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfcoy","html_url":"https://github.com/sfcoy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfcoy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfcoy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfcoy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfcoy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfcoy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfcoy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfcoy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfcoy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfcoy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sfcoy/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR removes the restriction in `HadoopFSUtils.parallelListLeafFiles` which only calls `listLocatedStatus` when the `FileSystem` is either `DistributedFileSystem` or `ViewFileSystem`. Instead, this checks locality flag and calls `listLocatedStatus` when that is set.\r\n\r\nConsequently, this also removes the special handling when locality info is required but the file system impl is neither above. Currently in this case we'd call `getFileBlockLocations` on each `FileStatus` obtained, and do some handling on missing files as well.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n`HadoopFsUtils.parallelListLeafFiles` currently only calls `listLocatedStatus` when the `FileSystem` impl is `DistributedFileSystem` or `ViewFileSystem`. For other types of `FileSystem`, it calls `listStatus` and then subsequently calls `getFileBlockLocations` on all the result `FileStatus`es. \r\n\r\nIn Hadoop client, `listLocatedStatus` is a well-defined API and in fact it is often overridden by specific file system implementations, such as S3A. The default `listLocatedStatus` also has similar behavior as it's done in Spark.\r\n\r\nTherefore, instead of re-implement the logic in Spark itself, it's better to rely on the `FileSystem`-specific implementation for `listLocatedStatus`, which could include its own optimizations in the code path.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThere could be some behavior change when `spark.sql.files.ignoreMissingFiles` is set and there are race conditions during listing. \r\n\r\nFor instance, assume locality info is required and some files in the listing result _were deleted right after the listing op, but before the subsequent `getFileBlockLocations` calls_ .  in the previous code. The previous implementation would return partial listing result, but the current impl will return an empty set, since the default `FileSystem.listLocatedStatus` will call `getFileBlockLocations` internally which will cause it fail as a whole.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it's also possible that new implementation returns a full list rather than a partial list in the previous impl, since we don't call `getFileBlockLocations` as a separate step now which eliminates some possibility that a file was deleted before the `getFileBlockLocations` as in the previous impl.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nRelying on existing tests.","created_at":"2020-10-12T21:31:01Z","updated_at":"2021-02-05T00:47:28Z","closed_at":"2021-02-05T00:47:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2d2ada2868f1a80cdee380dc6dcab2046d9d7ebd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30019/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30019/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30019/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3c0ad259bea09095da30863af9e614e23cfff0d6","head":{"label":"sunchao:SPARK-32381-followup-2","ref":"SPARK-32381-followup-2","sha":"3c0ad259bea09095da30863af9e614e23cfff0d6","user":{"login":"sunchao","id":506679,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506679?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao","html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":29795757,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTc5NTc1Nw==","name":"spark","full_name":"sunchao/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sunchao","id":506679,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506679?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao","html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIn Spark 2.3.0 and previous versions, Hive CTAS command will convert to use data source to write data into the table when the table is convertible. This behavior is controlled by the configs like HiveUtils.CONVERT_METASTORE_ORC and HiveUtils.CONVERT_METASTORE_PARQUET.\r\n\r\nIn 2.3.1, we drop this optimization by mistake in the PR [SPARK-22977](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/20521/files#r217254430). Since that Hive CTAS command only uses Hive Serde to write data.\r\n\r\nThis patch adds this optimization back to Hive CTAS command. This patch adds OptimizedCreateHiveTableAsSelectCommand which uses data source to write data.\r\n\r\nThis is to backport #22514 to branch-2.4.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis bug was originally reported in 2.3.1, but only fixed in 3.0. We should have it in branch-2.4 because the branch is LTS.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes. Users can use the config to use built-in data source writer instead of Hive serde in CTAS.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnit tests.","created_at":"2020-10-12T16:27:32Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:28:34Z","closed_at":"2020-10-12T20:53:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3b454eded7bb11bb8c2adba505801945abcc885f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30017/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30017/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30017/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e3ffaaf63cf467c351cac24b9f0eaa1b63f308c2","head":{"label":"viirya:SPARK-25271-2.4","ref":"SPARK-25271-2.4","sha":"e3ffaaf63cf467c351cac24b9f0eaa1b63f308c2","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nuse `lazy array` instead of `var` for auxiliary variables in binary lor\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29255, I made a mistake:\r\nthe `private var _threshold` and `_rawThreshold`  are initialized by defaut values of `threshold`, that is beacuse: \r\n1, param `threshold` is set default value at first;\r\n2, `_threshold` and `_rawThreshold` are initialized based on the default value;\r\n3, param `threshold` is updated by the value from estimator, by `copyValues` method:\r\n```\r\n      if (map.contains(param) && to.hasParam(param.name)) {\r\n        to.set(param.name, map(param))\r\n      }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can update `_threshold` and `_rawThreshold` in `setThreshold` and `setThresholds`, but we can not update them in `set`/`copyValues` so their values are kept until methods `setThreshold` and `setThresholds` are called.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\ntest in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to rebalance GitHub Action jobs to achieve `70 minutes` testing time.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n- [x] **Parallelism**: Increase the test parallelism from 2 to 3.\r\n- [x] **Scalastyle**: Disable SBT scalastyle in building for UTs because we have `lint` job separately and Jenkins PRBuilder also do the same thing.\r\n- [x] **SQL**: This has a longest job still. We can move some jobs from `sql - other tests` to `sql - slow tests` because there is a room in `sql - slow tests`.\r\n- [x] **Python**: The sum of total execution time of two Python GitHub Action jobs is 3 hour 14 minutes.

are two resolvers (bootResolvers's \"local\" and manually added \"local\") that point to the same local Ivy repo, but have different configurations, which led to excessive warnings in logs and, potentially, resolution issues.\r\nChangeset fixes that case, observable in sbt output as \r\n```\r\n[warn] Multiple resolvers having different access mechanism configured with same name 'local'.

This PR is to add the support to write Hive ORC/Parquet bucketed table with hivehash. The change is to custom `bucketIdExpression` to use `HiveHash` when the table is Hive bucketed table, and the Hive version is 1.x.y or 2.x.y. Support for Hive 3 will be added later in other PR after Hive murmur3hash being added in spark.\r\n\r\nThe changes are mostly on:\r\n* `HiveMetastoreCatalog.scala`: When converting hive table relation to data source relation, pass bucket info (`BucketSpec`) and other hive related info as `options` into `HadoopFsRelation` and `LogicalRelation`, which can be later accessed by `InsertIntoHadoopFsRelationCommand` and `FileFormatWriter`.\r\n\r\n* `FileFormatWriter.scala`: Use `HiveHash` for `bucketIdExpression` if it's writing to hive bucketed table. In addition, spark output file name should follow Hive (and Presto) bucketed file naming convention. Introduce another parameter `bucketFileNamePrefix` and it introduces subsequent change in `FileCommitProtocol` and `HadoopMapReduceCommitProtocol`.\r\n\r\n* `DataSourceScanExec.scala`: Add an extra check for `bucketedScan` that makes sure not enable bucketing when reading hive bucketed table as we propagate bucket spec from every hive relation (read and write) in `HiveMetastoreCatalog.scala`.\r\n \r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTo make spark write other-SQL-engines-compatible bucketed table. Currently spark bucketed table cannot be leveraged by other SQL engines like hive and presto, because it uses a different hash function (spark murmur3hash). With this PR, the spark-written-hive-bucketed-table can be efficiently read by presto and hive to do bucket filter pruning, join, group-by, etc. This was and is blocking several companies (confirmed from facebook, uber, etc) migrate bucketing workload from hive to spark.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, any hive bucketed table written by spark with hive 1/2, is properly bucketed and can be efficiently processed by presto and hive.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n1. Added unit test in `BucketedWriteWithHiveSupportSuite.scala`, to verify bucket file names and each row in each bucket is written properly.\r\n\r\n2. Cross engines test (take prestosql as example here): set up presto server and hive metastore locally in laptop, and run presto and spark queries locally in laptop.\r\n\r\nCreated a hive bucketed table by using presto:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE hive.di.chengsu_table (\r\n  key int,\r\n  value varchar,\r\n  part varchar\r\n)\r\nWITH (\r\n  format = 'PARQUET',\r\n  partitioned_by = ARRAY['part'],\r\n  bucketed_by = ARRAY['key'],\r\n  bucket_count = 8\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWrite hive bucketed table (part='part0') by using spark, and read the table by using presto. Verify presto bucket pruning work:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\npresto:default> SELECT * FROM hive.di.chengsu_table WHERE part='part0' AND \"$bucket\" in (2);\r\n key | value | part  \r\n-----+-------+-------\r\n   2 | 2     | part0 \r\n  10 | 10    | part0 \r\n  18 | 18    | part0 \r\n(3 rows)\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnderlying files in the partition directory:\r\n\r\n```\r\nchengsu@chengsu-mbp part=part0 % ls\r\n00002_0_part-00000-ccb3dc48-76b2-41fb-8030-7a6601a64bb3_00002.c000.snappy.parquet\r\n00005_0_part-00000-ccb3dc48-76b2-41fb-8030-7a6601a64bb3_00005.c000.snappy.parquet\r\n```\r\n\r\nWrite the hive bucketed table by using presto (NOTE: after this, one partition contains both presto and spark written files):\r\n\r\n```sql\r\npresto:default> INSERT INTO hive.di.chengsu_table\r\n             -> VALUES\r\n             ->   (0, '0', 'part0'),\r\n             ->   (1, '1', 'part0'),\r\n             ->   (2, '2', 'part0'),\r\n             ->   (1, '1', 'part1'),\r\n             ->   (2, '2', 'part1'),\r\n             ->   (3, '3', 'part1');\r\n```\r\n\r\nUse presto read the partition again, verify the bucket pruning work on mixed data written by spark and presto:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\npresto:default> SELECT * FROM hive.di.chengsu_table WHERE part='part0' AND \"$bucket\" in (2);\r\n key | value | part  \r\n-----+-------+-------\r\n   2 | 2     | part0 \r\n  10 | 10    | part0 \r\n  18 | 18    | part0 \r\n   2 | 2     | part0 \r\n```\r\n\r\nUnderlying files in partition directory:\r\n\r\n```\r\nchengsu@chengsu-mbp part=part0 % ls\r\n000000_0_20201010_200332_00028_tct3t\r\n000001_0_20201010_200332_00028_tct3t\r\n000002_0_20201010_200332_00028_tct3t\r\n00002_0_part-00000-ccb3dc48-76b2-41fb-8030-7a6601a64bb3_00002.c000.snappy.parquet\r\n00005_0_part-00000-ccb3dc48-76b2-41fb-8030-7a6601a64bb3_00005.c000.snappy.parquet\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn addition, verify join spark-written-bucketed-table and presto-written-bucketed table and the result looks correct:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\npresto:default> SELECT t1.key, t1.value, t2.key, t2.value\r\n             -> FROM hive.di.chengsu_table t1\r\n             -> JOIN hive.di.chengsu_table t2\r\n             -> ON t1.value = t2.value\r\n             -> AND t1.part = 'part0'\r\n             -> AND t2.part = 'part1';\r\n key | value | key | value \r\n-----+-------+-----+-------\r\n   2 | 2     |   2 | 2     \r\n   2 | 2     |   2 | 2     \r\n   1 | 1     |   1 | 1     \r\n   2 | 2     |   2 | 2     \r\n   2 | 2     |   2 | 2    \r\n```\r\n\r\nAggregate on spark-written-bucketed-table and the result looks correct:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\npresto:default> SELECT key, COUNT(*)\r\n             -> FROM hive.di.chengsu_table\r\n             -> WHERE part = 'part0'\r\n             -> GROUP BY key;\r\n key | _col1 \r\n-----+-------\r\n   0 |     1 \r\n   5 |     1 \r\n  13 |     1 \r\n   1 |     1 \r\n

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1, when `predictionCol` and `quantilesCol` are both set, we only need one prediction for each row: prediction is just the variable `lambda` in `predictQuantiles`;\r\n2, in the computation of variable `quantiles` in `predictQuantiles`, a pre-computed vector `val baseQuantiles = $(quantileProbabilities).map(q =>

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSpark already support `LIKE ALL` syntax, but it will throw `StackOverflowError` if there are many elements(more than 14378 elements). We should implement built-in function for LIKE ALL to fix this issue.\r\n\r\nWhy the stack overflow can happen in the current approach ?\r\nThe current approach uses reduceLeft to connect each `Like(e, p)`, this will lead the the call depth of the thread is too large, causing `StackOverflowError` problems.\r\n\r\nWhy the fix in this PR can avoid the error?\r\nThis PR support built-in function for `LIKE ALL` and avoid this issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1.Fix the `StackOverflowError` issue.\r\n2.Support built-in function `like_all`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n'No'.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nJenkins

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to remove `sbt-dependency-graph` SBT plugin.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`sbt-dependency-graph` officially doesn't support SBT 1.3.x and it's broken due to `NoSuchMethodError`. This cannot be fixed in `sbt-dependency-graph` side at SBT 1.3.x\r\n- https://github.com/sbt/sbt-dependency-graph\r\n    > Note: Under sbt >= 1.3.x some features might currently not work as expected or not at all (like dependencyLicenses).\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt dependencyTree\r\nLaunching sbt from build/sbt-launch-1.3.13.jar\r\n[info] welcome to sbt 1.3.13 (AdoptOpenJDK Java

One alternative is `coursier`, but it requires `coursier-based sbt launcher` which is more intrusive. \r\n  - https://get-coursier.io/docs/sbt-coursier.html#sbt-13x\r\n    > you'll have to use the coursier-based sbt launcher, via its custom sbt-extras launcher for example.\r\n\r\n- Another alternative is moving to `SBT 1.4.0` which uses `sbt-dependency-graph` as a built-in, but it's still new and will requires many change.\r\n\r\nSo, this PR aims to remove the broken plugin simply. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo. This is a dev-only change.\r\n\r\n###

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrent solution in build file to enable build failure on compilation warnings with exclusion of deprecation ones is not portable after SBT version 1.3.13 (build import fails with compilation error with SBT 1.4) and could be replaced with more robust and maintainable, especially since Scala 2.13.2 with similar built-in functionality.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, warnings were fixed to pass the build, with as few changes as possible:\r\nwarnings in 2.12 compilation fixed in code,\r\nwarnings in 2.13 compilation covered by configuration to be addressed separately\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nUnblocks upgrade to SBT after 1.3.13.\r\nEnhances build file maintainability.\r\nAllows fine tune of warnings

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFix `InConversion` rule by finding the common wider type of list expressions first and then the final common type for comparison between the value and the list expressions.\r\n\r\nBefore this PR the query `SELECT * FROM t WHERE c IN ('2')` where c is `Int` generated the following filter:\r\n```\r\nFilter cast(c#31 as string) IN (cast(2 as string))\r\n```\r\nAfter this PR it generates:\r\n```\r\nFilter cast(c#31 as int) IN (cast(2 as int))\r\n```\r\nthat is identical to what a `WHERE c = '2'` would do.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo make `In` behave like `=` and avoid issues described in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-33098 \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, some queries will not fail.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting UTs and I will add some new ones as

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nPropagate LibSVM options to Hadoop configs in the LibSVM datasource.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThere is a bug that when running:\r\n```scala\r\nspark.read.format(\"libsvm\").options(conf).load(path)\r\n```\r\nThe underlying file system will not receive the `conf` options.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. After the changes, for example, users should read files from Azure Data Lake successfully:\r\n```scala\r\ndef hadoopConf1() = Map[String, String](\r\n  s\"fs.adl.oauth2.access.token.provider.type\" -> \"ClientCredential\",\r\n  s\"fs.adl.oauth2.client.id\" -> dbutils.secrets.get(scope = \"...\", key = \"...\"),\r\n  s\"fs.adl.oauth2.credential\" -> dbutils.secrets.get(scope = \"...\", key = \"...\"),\r\n  s\"fs.adl.oauth2.refresh.url\" -> s\"https://login.microsoftonline.com/.../oauth2/token\")\r\nval df = spark.read.format(\"libsvm\").options(hadoopConf1).load(\"adl://....azuredatalakestore.net/foldersp1/...\")\r\n```\r\nand not get the following exception because the settings above are not propagated to the filesystem:\r\n```java\r\njava.lang.IllegalArgumentException: No value for fs.adl.oauth2.access.token.provider found in conf file.\r\n\tat ....adl.AdlFileSystem.getNonEmptyVal(AdlFileSystem.java:820)\r\n\tat ....adl.AdlFileSystem.getCustomAccessTokenProvider(AdlFileSystem.java:220)\r\n\tat ....adl.AdlFileSystem.getAccessTokenProvider(AdlFileSystem.java:257)\r\n\tat ....adl.AdlFileSystem.initialize(AdlFileSystem.java:164)\r\n\tat org.apache.hadoop.fs.FileSystem.createFileSystem(FileSystem.java:2669)\r\n``` \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded UT to `LibSVMRelationSuite`.\r\n\r\nAuthored-by: Max Gekk

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAs [SPARK-13860](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-13860) stated, TPCDS Query 39 returns wrong results using SparkSQL. The root cause is that when stddev_samp is applied to a single element set, with TPCDS answer, it return null; as in SparkSQL, it return Double.NaN which caused the wrong result.\r\n\r\nAdd an extra legacy config to fallback into the NaN logical, and return null by default to align with TPCDS standard.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSQL correctness issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes. See sql-migration-guide\r\n\r\nIn Spark 3.1, statistical aggregation function includes `std`, `stddev`, `stddev_samp`, `variance`, `var_samp`, `skewness`, `kurtosis`, `covar_samp`, `corr` will return `NULL` instead of `Double.NaN` when `DivideByZero` occurs during expression evaluation, for example, when `stddev_samp` applied on a single element set. In Spark version 3.0 and earlier, it will return `Double.NaN` in such case. To restore the behavior before Spark 3.1, you can set `spark.sql.legacy.statisticalAggregate` to `true`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUpdated

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nNow the spark-sql does not support parse the sql statements with bracketed comments.\r\nFor the sql statements:\r\n```\r\n/* SELECT 'test'; */\r\nSELECT 'test';\r\n```\r\nWould be split to two statements:\r\nThe first one: `/* SELECT 'test'`\r\nThe second one: `*/ SELECT 'test'`\r\n\r\nThen it would throw an exception because the first one is illegal.\r\nIn this PR, we ignore the content in bracketed comments while splitting the sql statements.\r\nBesides, we ignore the comment without any content.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSpark-sql might split the statements inside bracketed comments and it is not correct.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to protect the executor pod request or pending pod during executor idle timeout.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn case of dynamic allocation, Apache Spark K8s `ExecutorPodsAllocator` cancels the pod requests or pending pods too eagerly. Like the following example, `ExecutorPodsAllocator` received the new total executor adjust request rapidly in two minutes. Sometimes, it's called 3 times in a single second. It repeats `request` and `delete` on that request or pending pod frequently. This PR is reusing `spark.dynamicAllocation.executorIdleTimeout (default: 60s)` to keep the pod request or pending pod.\r\n\r\n```\r\n20/10/08 05:58:08 INFO ExecutorPodsAllocator: Set

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nMetricSystem picks up new metrics from sources that are added throughout execution. If you do measurements via dynamic proxies you might not want to redeclare all metrics that the proxies will create and you'd prefer them to get populated as they're being produced. Right now all sources are processed only onceat startup and metrics are picked up only if they have been registered statically at compile time. Behaviour I am proposing lets you not have to declare metrics in two places.\r\n\r\nThis had been previously suggested in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/18406. I have reduced the scope of the change to just dynamic metric registration.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently there's no way to access MetricRegistry that MetricsSystem uses to hold its state and as such it's not possible to reprocess a source. MetricsSystem throws if any metric had already been registered previously.\r\n\r\nn.b. the MetricRegistry is added as a constructor argument to make testing easier but could as well be accessed via reflection as a private variable.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nProposing a new set of APIs for ExecutorPlugins, to provide callbacks invoked at the start and end of each task of a job. Not very opinionated on the shape of the API, tried to be as minimal as possible for now.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nChanges described in detail on [SPARK-33088](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-33088), but mostly this boils down to:\r\n\r\n1. This feature was considered when the ExecutorPlugin API was initially introduced in #21923, but never implemented.\r\n2. The use-case which **requires** this feature is to propagate tracing information from the driver to the executor, such that calls from the same job can all be traced.\r\n  a. Tracing frameworks usually are setup in thread locals, therefore it's important for the setup to happen in the same thread which runs the tasks.\r\n  b. Executors can be for multiple jobs, therefore it's not sufficient to set tracing information at executor startup time -- it needs to happen every time a task starts or ends.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo. This PR introduces new features for future developers to use.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests on `PluginContainerSuite`.","created_at":"2020-10-08T14:14:15Z","updated_at":"2020-10-17T03:09:01Z","closed_at":"2020-10-16T03:14:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ceacf8dcc375363a34485fa1234342e5eabc3939","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29977/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29977/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29977/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8a5e43671b3ffc16a6d3630886027cde97380558","head":{"label":"fsamuel-bs:SPARK-33088","ref":"SPARK-33088","sha":"8a5e43671b3ffc16a6d3630886027cde97380558","user":{"login":"fsamuel-bs","id":2558069,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NTgwNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2558069?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsamuel-bs","html_url":"https://github.com/fsamuel-bs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsamuel-bs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsamuel-bs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsamuel-bs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsamuel-bs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsamuel-bs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsamuel-bs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsamuel-bs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsamuel-bs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsamuel-bs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":302020333,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMDIwMjAzMzM=","name":"spark","full_name":"fsamuel-bs/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fsamuel-bs","id":2558069,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NTgwNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2558069?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsamuel-bs","html_url":"https://github.com/fsamuel-bs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsamuel-bs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsamuel-bs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsamuel-bs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsamuel-bs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsamuel-bs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsamuel-bs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsamuel-bs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsamuel-bs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsamuel-bs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fsamuel-bs/spark","description":"Palantir

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a kind of a followup of SPARK-32646. New JIRA was filed to control the fixed versions properly.\r\n\r\nWhen you use `map`, it might be lazily evaluated and not executed. To avoid this,  we should better use `foreach`. See also SPARK-16694. Current codes look not causing any bug for now but it should be best to fix to avoid potential issues.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo avoid potential issues from `map` being lazy and not executed.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nRan related tests. CI in this PR should

doesn't support some ALTER TABLE at the moment. This PR supports DB2 specific ALTER TABLE.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running new integration test

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR makes `DataFrameWriterV2` to create query plans with `UnresolvedRelation` and leave the table resolution work to the analyzer.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTable resolution work should be done by the analyzer. After this PR, the behavior is more consistent between different APIs (DataFrameWriter, DataFrameWriterV2 and SQL). See the next section for behavior changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes.\r\n1. writes to a temp view of v2 relation: previously it fails with table not found exception, now it works if the v2 relation is writable. This is consistent with `DataFrameWriter` and SQL INSERT.\r\n2. writes to other temp views: previously it fails with table not found exception, now it fails with a more explicit error message, saying that writing to a temp view of non-v2-relation is not allowed.\r\n3. writes to a view: previously it fails with table not writable error, now it fails with a more explicit error message, saying that writing to a view is not allowed.\r\n4. writes to a v1 table: previously it fails with table not writable error, now it fails with a more explicit error message, saying that writing to a v1 table is not allowed. (We can allow it later, by falling back to v1 command)\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nnew

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWith following scenario when AQE is on, SQLMetrics could be incorrect.\r\n\r\n1. Stage A and B are created, and UI updated thru event onAdaptiveExecutionUpdate.\r\n2. Stage A and B are running. Subquery in stage A keep updating metrics thru event onAdaptiveSQLMetricUpdate.\r\n3. Stage B completes, while stage A's subquery is still running, updating metrics.\r\n4. Completion of stage B triggers new stage creation and UI update thru event onAdaptiveExecutionUpdate again (just like step 1).\r\n\r\nSo decided to make a trade off of keeping more duplicate SQLMetrics without deleting them when AQE with newPlan updated.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nMake SQLMetrics behavior 100% correct.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAt the moment there is no possibility to turn off JDBC authentication providers which exists on the classpath. This can be problematic because service providers are loaded with service loader. In this PR I've added `spark.sql.sources.disabledJdbcConnProviderList` configuration possibility (default: empty).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nNo possibility to turn off JDBC authentication providers. There are 2 main use-cases where it could be useful:\r\n* The built-in provider works fine for a specific database (for example MSSQL) but the user wants different authentication functionality which is not able to be done with the built-in one. Such case the user implements a new provider but when added then 2 providers will be in place to handle MSSQL authentication (the binding is class name based). Such case the built-in one must be turned off to use the new one.\r\n* The built-in provider contains a bug for a specific database. Such case full Spark patch build can be provided in normal case but this configuration opens new ways in testing and patching. Namely one can easily send a custom provider to proof/solve provider related issues (of course temporarily).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, it introduces new configuration option.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n* Existing + newly added unit tests.\r\n* Existing integration

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis improves error handling when a failure in conversion from Pandas to Arrow occurs. And fixes tests to be compatible with upcoming Arrow 2.0.0 release.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCurrent tests will fail with Arrow 2.0.0 because of a change in error message when the schema is invalid. For these cases, the current error message also includes information on disabling safe conversion config, which is mainly meant for floating point truncation and overflow. The tests have been updated to use a message that is show for past Arrow versions, and upcoming.\r\n\r\nIf the user enters an invalid schema, the error produced by pyarrow is not consistent and either `TypeError` or `ArrowInvalid`, with the latter being caught, and raised as a `RuntimeError` with the extra info.\r\n\r\nThe error handling is improved by:\r\n\r\n- narrowing the exception type to `TypeError`s, which `ArrowInvalid` is a subclass and what is raised on safe conversion failures.\r\n- The exception is only raised with additional information on disabling \"spark.sql.execution.pandas.convertToArrowArraySafely\" if it is enabled in the first place.\r\n- The original exception is chained to better show it to the user (only for Spark 3.1+ which requires Python 3)\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, the error re-raised changes from a RuntimeError to a ValueError, which better categorizes this type of error and in-line with the original Arrow error.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nExisting tests, using pyarrow 1.0.1 and 2.0.0-snapshot, and Python 2 with 0.15.1","created_at":"2020-10-07T05:57:56Z","updated_at":"2020-10-07T18:44:01Z","closed_at":"2020-10-07T09:17:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3e8618de3e746373d788fe15efae6a0b5a507ca6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29962/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29962/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29962/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5c3c195d4d260a8497c898ce2910ed143bd19e1d","head":{"label":"BryanCutler:arrow-better-handle-pandas-errors-SPARK-33073-branch-3.0","ref":"arrow-better-handle-pandas-errors-SPARK-33073-branch-3.0","sha":"5c3c195d4d260a8497c898ce2910ed143bd19e1d","user":{"login":"BryanCutler","id":4534389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzQzODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4534389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler","html_url":"https://github.com/BryanCutler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34092463,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDA5MjQ2Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"BryanCutler/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"BryanCutler","id":4534389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzQzODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4534389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler","html_url":"https://github.com/BryanCutler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/BryanCutler/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nSPARK-32926 added a build test to GitHub Action for Scala 2.13 but it's only with Maven.\r\nAs SPARK-32873 reported, some compilation error happens only with SBT so I think we need to add another build test to GitHub Action for SBT.\r\nUnfortunately, we don't have abundant resources for GitHub Actions so instead of just adding the new SBT job, let's replace the existing Maven job with the new SBT job for Scala 2.13.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo ensure build test passes even with SBT for Scala 2.13.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nGitHub Actions'

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR intends to fix corner-case bugs in the `QueryPlan#transformUpWithNewOutput` that is used to propagate updated `ExprId`s in a bottom-up way. Let's say we have a rule to simply assign new `ExprId`s in a projection list like this;\r\n```scala\r\ncase class TestRule extends Rule[LogicalPlan] {\r\n  override def apply(plan: LogicalPlan): LogicalPlan = plan.transformUpWithNewOutput {\r\n    case p @ Project(projList, _) =>\r\n      val newPlan = p.copy(projectList = projList.map { _.transform {\r\n        // Assigns a new `ExprId` for references\r\n        case a: AttributeReference => Alias(a, a.name)()\r\n      }}.asInstanceOf[Seq[NamedExpression]])\r\n\r\n      val attrMapping = p.output.zip(newPlan.output)\r\n      newPlan -> attrMapping\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThen, this rule is applied into a plan below;\r\n```scala\r\n(3) Project [a#5, b#6]\r\n+- (2) Project [a#5, b#6]\r\n   +- (1) Project [a#5, b#6]\r\n      +- LocalRelation <empty>, [a#5, b#6]\r\n```\r\nIn the first transformation, the rule assigns new `ExprId`s in `(1) Project` (e.g., a#5 AS a#7, b#6 AS b#8). In the second transformation, the rule corrects the input references of `(2) Project`  first by using attribute mapping given from `(1) Project` (a#5->a#7 and b#6->b#8) and then assigns new `ExprId`s (e.g., a#7 AS a#9, b#8 AS b#10). But, in the third transformation, the rule fails because it tries to correct the references of `(3) Project` by using incorrect attribute mapping (a#7->a#9 and b#8->b#10) even though the correct one is a#5->a#9 and b#6->b#10. To fix this issue, this PR modified the code to update the attribute mapping entries that are obsoleted by generated entries in a given rule.\r\n\r\nThis is the backport of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29911.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nbugfix.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdded tests in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1. Add new method to the `JdbcDialect` class - `classifyException()`. It converts dialect specific exception to Spark's `AnalysisException` or its sub-classes.\r\n2. Replace H2 exception  `org.h2.jdbc.JdbcSQLException` in `JDBCTableCatalogSuite` by `AnalysisException`.\r\n3. Add `H2Dialect`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently JDBC v2 Table Catalog implementation throws dialect specific exception and ignores exceptions defined in the `TableCatalog` interface. This PR adds new method for converting dialect specific exception, and assumes that follow up PRs will implement `classifyException()`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running existing test suites `JDBCTableCatalogSuite` and `JDBCV2Suite`.","created_at":"2020-10-06T08:33:24Z","updated_at":"2020-12-11T20:28:24Z","closed_at":"2020-10-08T05:28:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"131cf5acff6352c294803a2635986a381ce8079d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29952/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29952/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29952/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ac55879e80bbb964c1563466a8171f7a8fb2720d","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:jdbcv2-classify-exception","ref":"jdbcv2-classify-exception","sha":"ac55879e80bbb964c1563466a8171f7a8fb2720d","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis improves error handling when a failure in conversion from Pandas to Arrow occurs. And fixes tests to be compatible with upcoming Arrow 2.0.0 release.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCurrent tests will fail with Arrow 2.0.0 because of a change in error message when the schema is invalid. For these cases, the current error message also includes information on disabling safe conversion config, which is mainly meant for floating point truncation and overflow. The tests have been updated to use a message that is show for past Arrow versions, and upcoming.\r\n\r\nIf the user enters an invalid schema, the error produced by pyarrow is not consistent and either `TypeError` or `ArrowInvalid`, with the latter being caught, and raised as a `RuntimeError` with the extra info.\r\n\r\nThe error handling is improved by:\r\n\r\n- narrowing the exception type to `TypeError`s, which `ArrowInvalid` is a subclass and what is raised on safe conversion failures.\r\n- The exception is only raised with additional information on disabling \"spark.sql.execution.pandas.convertToArrowArraySafely\" if it is enabled in the first place.\r\n- The original exception is chained to better show it to the user.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, the error re-raised changes from a RuntimeError to a ValueError, which better categorizes this type of error and in-line with the original Arrow error.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to avoid collapsing adjacent `Project` in query optimizer if the combined `Project` will duplicate too many common expressions. One SQL config `spark.sql.optimizer.maxCommonExprsInCollapseProject` is added to set up the maximum allowed number of common expressions.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIn some edge cases, collapsing adjacent `Project` hurts performance, instead of improving it. We observed such behavior in our customer Spark jobs where one expensive expression was repeatedly duplicated many times. It is hard to have a optimizer rule that could decide whether to collapse two `Project`s because we don't know the cost of each expression. Currently we can provide a SQL config so users can set it up to change optimizer's behavior regarding collapsing adjacent `Project`s.\r\n\r\nNote that normally in whole-stage codegen Project operator will de-duplicate expressions internally, but in edge cases Spark cannot do whole-stage codegen and fallback to interpreted mode. In such cases, users can use this config to avoid duplicate expressions.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes. Users can change optimizer's behavior regarding collapsing `Project`s by setting SQL config.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a backport of #26831.\r\n\r\nNow spark use `ObjectInspectorCopyOption.JAVA` as oi option which will convert any string to UTF-8 string. When write non UTF-8 code data, then `EFBFBD` will appear.\r\nWe should use `ObjectInspectorCopyOption.DEFAULT` to support pass the bytes.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nHere is the way to reproduce:\r\n1. make a file contains 16 radix 'AABBCC' which is not the UTF-8 code.\r\n2. create table test1 (c string) location '$file_path';\r\n3. select hex(c) from test1; // AABBCC\r\n4. craete table test2 (c string) as select c from test1;\r\n5. select hex(c) from test2; // EFBFBDEFBFBDEFBFBD\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CI.","created_at":"2020-10-05T22:31:39Z","updated_at":"2020-10-06T13:23:02Z","closed_at":"2020-10-06T03:13:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f2d85443f20af0e5575482141681b78c5f42ee81","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29948/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29948/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29948/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0c31eeb894594c1e17f418618a643feb50ac2487","head":{"label":"anuragmantri:SPARK-30201-2.4","ref":"SPARK-30201-2.4","sha":"0c31eeb894594c1e17f418618a643feb50ac2487","user":{"login":"anuragmantri","id":13743212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzQzMjEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13743212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuragmantri","html_url":"https://github.com/anuragmantri","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuragmantri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuragmantri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuragmantri/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuragmantri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuragmantri/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuragmantri/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuragmantri/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuragmantri/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuragmantri/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":301523325,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMDE1MjMzMjU=","name":"spark","full_name":"anuragmantri/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"anuragmantri","id":13743212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzQzMjEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13743212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuragmantri","html_url":"https://github.com/anuragmantri","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuragmantri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuragmantri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuragmantri/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuragmantri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuragmantri/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuragmantri/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuragmantri/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuragmantri/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuragmantri/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/anuragmantri/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdds a SQL function `raise_error` which underlies the refactored `assert_true` function. `assert_true` now also (optionally) accepts a custom error message field.\r\n`raise_error` is exposed in SQL, Python, Scala, and R.\r\n`assert_true` was previously only exposed in SQL; it is now also exposed in Python, Scala, and R.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nImproves usability of `assert_true` by clarifying error messaging, and adds the useful helper function `raise_error`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes:\r\n- Adds `raise_error` function to the SQL, Python, Scala, and R APIs.\r\n- Adds `assert_true` function to the SQL, Python and R APIs.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdds unit tests in SQL, Python, Scala, and R for `assert_true` and `raise_error`.","created_at":"2020-10-05T21:34:26Z","updated_at":"2020-10-08T10:28:49Z","closed_at":"2020-10-08T03:05:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b476e5d5387c3c2316b3e6f64ab8033308e3d855","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29947/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29947/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29947/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5b93fd49313152356a3fd2baf6c21123170c4037","head":{"label":"karenfeng:spark-32793","ref":"spark-32793","sha":"5b93fd49313152356a3fd2baf6c21123170c4037","user":{"login":"karenfeng","id":4754931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NTQ5MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4754931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/karenfeng","html_url":"https://github.com/karenfeng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karenfeng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karenfeng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karenfeng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karenfeng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karenfeng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karenfeng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karenfeng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karenfeng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karenfeng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":263201423,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjMyMDE0MjM=","name":"spark-1","full_name":"karenfeng/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"karenfeng","id":4754931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NTQ5MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4754931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/karenfeng","html_url":"https://github.com/karenfeng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karenfeng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karenfeng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karenfeng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karenfeng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karenfeng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karenfeng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karenfeng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karenfeng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karenfeng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/karenfeng/spark-1","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to skip test reporting (\"Report test results\") if there are no JUnit XML files are found.\r\n\r\nCurrently, we're running and skipping the tests dynamically. For example,\r\n- if there are only changes in SparkR at the underlying commit, it only runs the SparkR tests, and skip the other tests and generate JUnit XML files for SparkR test cases.\r\n- if there are only changes in `docs` at the underlying commit, the build skips all tests except linters and do not generate any JUnit XML files.\r\n\r\nWhen test reporting (\"Report test results\") job is triggered after the main build (\"Build and test\r\n\") is finished, and there are no JUnit XML files found, it reports the case as a failure. See https://github.com/apache/spark/runs/1196184007 as an example.\r\n\r\nThis PR works around it by simply skipping the testing report when there are no JUnit XML files are found.\r\nPlease see https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29906#issuecomment-702525542 for more details.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo avoid false alarm for test results.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, dev-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested in my fork.\r\n\r\nPositive
