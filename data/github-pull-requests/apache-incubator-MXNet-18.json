Description ##\r\nGluon.probability is part of MXNet 2.0's new features (https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/16167, https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/17240)\r\n\r\nIt is a module under  `mx.gluon.probability` namespace.\r\n\r\n### Module details\r\n\r\nThis module is made up of three parts:\r\n\r\n- Distribution object\r\n\r\n- Bijector/Transformation\r\n\r\n- StochasticBlock\r\n\r\n#### Distribution object\r\n\r\nDistribution objects are light-weight object providing useful statistical function of a distribution.\r\n\r\n#### Bijector/Transformation\r\n\r\nClass representing an invertible or non-invertible transformation.\r\n\r\n#### StochasticBlock\r\n\r\nBlocks with loss accumlated during forward.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Demo\r\n\r\nA few toy demos can be found in https://github.com/xidulu/mystery_demo, demos still need further refinement, but I believe they can demonstrate some basic functionality of this module.\r\n\r\n\r\n##### Transformations with learnable parameters\r\nGAN/RealNVP demonstrates how to build a deep generative model with learnable tranformations.\r\nhttps://github.com/xidulu/mystery_demo/blob/master/GAN.ipynb\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/xidulu/mystery_demo/blob/master/real_nvp.ipynb\r\n\r\n\r\n##### Semi-supervised

(i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed

PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

Description ##\r\nThis PR adds the option to compute the gradient of Embedding and Take with safe accumulation,\r\ni.e. when dtype is FP16, accumulation can be done in FP32.\r\nIt fixes the underflow problem that was causing issue [https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/17703](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/17703)\r\nThis was happening when number of indices is very large, and vocabulary/data has small size.\r\nFor activating it, the user can set: MXNET_SAFE_ACCUMULATION=1\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for both Take and Embedding\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- [x] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\nSAFE_ACCUMULATION was added in the following operators\r\n- [x] _backward_Embedding - cpu (requires modification within mshadow)\r\n- [x]  _backward_Embedding - gpu\r\n- [x]  _backward_take - cpu, for any axis (requires modification within mshadow for axis=0)\r\n- [x]  _backward_take - gpu, for any axis (requires modification within mshadow for axis=0)\r\n## Comments ##\r\n\r\nPerformance review. Experiments on V100 GPU 16GB. \r\n4096 indices, vocab_size 30522, EmbeddingDim 768.\r\nTime ms (Average 10000 iters):\r\nEmbedding: FP32 0.915 | FP16 0.672 | FP12_safe_accumulation 0.646\r\nTake-axis0: FP32 2.92 | FP16 2.831 | FP12_safe_accumulation 2.842\r\nTake-axis1: FP32 3.241 | FP16 3.179 | FP12_safe_accumulation 3.151\r\nI do not observe any significant performance effect when activating SAFE_ACCUMULATION\r\n\r\n- We probably should set by default SAFE_ACCUMULATION=1 when using **Automatic Mixed Precision** to avoid issues

Description ##\r\nAs described in #16757 , a list of operators have their FInferType functions were throwing an exception if the input type is not defined (dtype=-1).\r\n\r\nThis was preventing us from running a partial or backward type inference where some not (yet) defined input dtypes would trigger an exception.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes it by making the FInferType functions do backward

`none`.","created_at":"2020-05-21T11:20:42Z","updated_at":"2020-08-23T19:59:06Z","closed_at":"2020-06-10T17:41:51Z","merged_at":"2020-06-10T17:41:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"26f44b71d8de84bbc88af496ae0aeb7ce535312d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/milestones/5","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet/milestone/5","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/milestones/5/labels","id":5800994,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNTgwMDk5NA==","number":5,"title":"v1.8.0","description":"Tracker

Description ##\r\nFix activations.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If

Description ##\r\nSymbol's `optimize_for` was failing when some parameters are missing in `args` or `aux` due to:\r\n- enforcing both in the Python front-end and back-end\r\n- no way to specify attributes of input \r\n- partial shape inference failing (also related to #18378 and  #18348 fixes)\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- Add `skip_infer` option to `symbol.optimize_for`, which skips the pre-partition attributes inference. Can be used for backends that does not need this (e.g. TensorRT).\r\n- Add optional `shape_dict`, `type_dict` and `stype_dict` to `optimize_for` to specify input data attributes for the pre-partition attributes inference passes. These can be used when some input and/or parameters are missing in `args`, e.g. input data (similarly to what is done in the `bind` functions).\r\n- Changes both Python and C++ functions to allow partial inference.\r\n\r\nCC @samskalicky

Description ##\r\nAs described in #16757 , a list of operators `FInferType` functions were throwing an exception if the input type is not defined (dtype=`-1`).\r\n\r\nThis was preventing us from running a partial type inference where some not (yet) defined input `dtype`s would trigger an exception.\r\n\r\nThe expected behavior is that `FInferType` returns false when the type cannot be inferred correctly, a boolean value that the executor inference pass uses to wet the `Graph` attribute `dtype_num_unknown_nodes`.\r\nThis attribute is then used by the executor or any graph modules (e.g. Partition API) to determine the correctness, or know if a new inference pass is required.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes it by making the `FInferType` functions return `false` when the input dtype is `-1`.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2020-05-15T09:23:43Z","updated_at":"2020-05-21T11:09:39Z","closed_at":"2020-05-21T11:09:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b0cfe808c2fd0ed508a44ffa75a9c2e706334659","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/18332/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/18332/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/18332/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/a4a27e71b63dac0a7cea4b0a393f8700143419e8","head":{"label":"Kh4L:fix_partial_infer_ops","ref":"fix_partial_infer_ops","sha":"a4a27e71b63dac0a7cea4b0a393f8700143419e8","user":{"login":"Kh4L","id":3193578,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxOTM1Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3193578?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kh4L","html_url":"https://github.com/Kh4L","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kh4L/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kh4L/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kh4L/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kh4L/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kh4L/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kh4L/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kh4L/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kh4L/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kh4L/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":185939764,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODU5Mzk3NjQ=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"Kh4L/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Kh4L","id":3193578,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxOTM1Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3193578?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kh4L","html_url":"https://github.com/Kh4L","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kh4L/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kh4L/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kh4L/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kh4L/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kh4L/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kh4L/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kh4L/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kh4L/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kh4L/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Kh4L/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nFixes #15533\r\n\r\nNotable change needed to happen to LARS optimizer, since it actually requires the lack of momentum correction, so I had to emulate it in the unaggregated case. I also moved and renamed contrib/preloaded_*_sgd -> lars_*_sgd operators (moved out of contrib because non-contrib functionality depends on them).\r\n\r\n@wkcn @zhreshold @szhengac  FYI\r\n\r\n##

coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- Tests have increased tolerance - the reason of this is that DNNL sometimes have significantly different value of single element in

Description ##\r\nAttempt to resolve issue mentioned in #16743\r\nIt is done by casting the inputs into mx_np or np.\r\nCurrent conversion rules:\r\n| Expression | a type | b type | out type|\r\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\r\n| `a += b` | onp | mx_np | onp |\r\n| `a += b` | mx_np | onp | mx_np |\r\n| `c = a + b` | onp | mx_np | onp |\r\n| `c = a + b` | mx_np | onp | mx_np |\r\n\r\nHowever, the example code in the issue still can't run due to type issue.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport mxnet as mx\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nmx.npx.set_np()\r\na = np.array(1) // the type in np is int64\r\na += mx.np.array(1) // the type in mx_np is float32\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with

coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2020-05-12T02:56:50Z","updated_at":"2020-05-24T16:15:10Z","closed_at":"2020-05-24T16:14:59Z","merged_at":"2020-05-24T16:14:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"9c2c5d45a6c838bd8348ce43a6168cf77d5c7125","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/18286/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/18286/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/18286/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/22524ea48cbfecd2431735956b1aacdc7ced2810","head":{"label":"Yiyan66:issue_mean","ref":"issue_mean","sha":"22524ea48cbfecd2431735956b1aacdc7ced2810","user":{"login":"Yiyan66","id":57363390,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MzYzMzkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57363390?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yiyan66","html_url":"https://github.com/Yiyan66","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yiyan66/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yiyan66/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yiyan66/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yiyan66/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yiyan66/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yiyan66/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yiyan66/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yiyan66/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yiyan66/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":221351337,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjEzNTEzMzc=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"Yiyan66/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Yiyan66","id":57363390,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MzYzMzkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57363390?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yiyan66","html_url":"https://github.com/Yiyan66","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yiyan66/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yiyan66/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yiyan66/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yiyan66/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yiyan66/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yiyan66/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yiyan66/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yiyan66/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yiyan66/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Yiyan66/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the

lines.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Disable linter checks where they are giving false positives\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\n\r\nThis is a backport of  #18199 for MXNet 1.x that doesn't break compatibility with existing models. \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Add a switch that switches between the old and the new implementation.\r\n- [x] Update the the unit test to test both implementations.\r\n- [x] Document the operator's switch.\r\n- [x] Document the switch in the Gluon block.\r\n- [x] Add a warning in the Gluon interface.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- Since `GroupNorm` will be moved to `npx` in MXNet 2.0, introducing a (dummy) `v2` parameter in MXNet 2.0 is not necessary, since backward compatibility will be broken anyways.\r\n- Should this be included with MXNet

Description ##\r\nMaking GPU kernel for argsort use int32_t. Existing implementation already uses optimized thrust library. Slowdown is only due to index_t -> int64_t when building with Large Tensor Support(LTS). Also, LTS is only supported for CPU for now. Changes are have been made in such a way that if MXNet support int64_t for GPU later the changes required would be minimal.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove

Description ##\r\nThis PR fixes #16231 ,  the fix is to delegate an event handler to parent node `ul` to prevent all its child nodes`<a/>` from triggering default click action (direct to target url, which cause the page to jump to the top). \r\n\r\nTo verify the change: \r\nGo to `get started` page and see \"Mxnet version\" drop down, scroll down a little bit and hover on the version drop down. After selecting any of the version, the page should stay at where is was (compare to unexpectedly jump to top of the page). \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove
