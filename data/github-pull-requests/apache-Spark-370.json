What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently,  `nullValue` option does not work for some types, `BooleanType`, `TimestampType`, `DateType` and `StringType`. So, currently there is no way to read null for those types. This PR adds the support just like the other types.\n\nAlso, CSV data source is not being tested with `HadoopFsRelationTest` as a `HadoopFsRelation`. `HadoopFsRelationTest` includes 50 more tests (eg. partitioned table tests).\n\nThis PR adds two variables, `extraReadOptions` and `extraWriteOptions` in `HadoopFsRelationTest` so that the child class gives some options for reading and writing. In order to get the tests in `HadoopFsRelationTest` passed, CSV data source needs to give options `header` and `inferSchema` as `true` for reading and `header` as `true` for writing.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnittests in `CSVHadoopFsRelationTest`, `CSVTypeCastSuite` and edited tests in `CSVSuite`\n","created_at":"2016-05-05T05:55:29Z","updated_at":"2018-01-02T03:40:22Z","closed_at":"2016-07-09T14:56:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"20b616188e1ff45bbc5d4819351a2f596fe62765","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12921/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12921/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12921/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/75f1cb8d7c7e89103b1ac0607512837693f7f699","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-15143-15144","ref":"SPARK-15143-15144","sha":"75f1cb8d7c7e89103b1ac0607512837693f7f699","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

think upgrading to 9 is necessary. I am using latest 9.2 since 9.3 requires Java 8+.\n\n`javax.servlet` and `derby` were also upgraded since Jetty 9.2 needs corresponding version.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nManual test and

spark-class.\n","created_at":"2016-05-04T21:43:53Z","updated_at":"2016-06-17T20:48:59Z","closed_at":"2016-05-10T17:36:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2bd579fde091563bd547c1fd66fac3ffef9eb75f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12910/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12910/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12910/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/552a48f09d627c6739e2c802a2821417be981c6f","head":{"label":"vanzin:SPARK-13670","ref":"SPARK-13670","sha":"552a48f09d627c6739e2c802a2821417be981c6f","user":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18302272,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODMwMjI3Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"vanzin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nA Generate with the `outer` flag enabled should always return one or more rows for every input row. The optimizer currently violates this by rewriting `outer` Generates that do not contain columns of the child plan into an unjoined generate, for example:\n\n``` sql\nselect e from a lateral view outer explode(a.b) as e\n```\n\nThe result of this is that `outer` Generate does not produce output at all when the Generators' input expression is empty. This PR fixes this.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded test case to

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently  empty quoted strings in the input CSV file are incorrectly recognized as null value.  This patch adds fix to recognizes quoted empty strings(eg; 1, \"\")  in the data are recognized by default as empty string values.  \n\nNew CSV  option emptyValue is added to allows users  to specify the value to write to the output CSV file for empty string, and also the value in in an input file  that should be interpreted as empty string in addition to the empty quoted string.\n\nDATA

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nBecause this test extracts data from `DStream.generatedRDDs` before stopping, it may get data before checkpointing. Then after recovering from the checkpoint, `recoveredOffsetRanges` may contain something not in `offsetRangesBeforeStop`, which will fail the test. Adding `Thread.sleep(1000)` before `ssc.stop()` will reproduce this failure.\n\nThis PR just moves the logic of `offsetRangesBeforeStop` (also renamed to `offsetRangesAfterStop`) after `ssc.stop()` to fix the flaky test.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nJenkins unit tests.\n","created_at":"2016-05-04T18:37:08Z","updated_at":"2016-06-22T13:12:07Z","closed_at":"2016-05-10T20:28:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"adaeb9e73cf5779740fbc18c3dfd1725a6eab966","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12903/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12903/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12903/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/91115b87a98485eca6bd4a8e62b27ccbfc145e41","head":{"label":"zsxwing:SPARK-6005","ref":"SPARK-6005","sha":"91115b87a98485eca6bd4a8e62b27ccbfc145e41","user":{"login":"zsxwing","id":1000778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDA3Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1000778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing","html_url":"https://github.com/zsxwing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"0fd3a4748416233f034ec137d95f0a4c8712d396","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWe will eliminate the pair of `DeserializeToObject` and `SerializeFromObject` in optimizer and add extra `Project`. However, when `DeserializeToObject`'s `outputObjectType` is `ObjectType` and its `cls` can't be processed by unsafe project, the projection will be failed.\n\nAs the extra `Project` is used to preserve output expr id, if the `DeserializeToObject` is at the top, we can avoid this extra `Project`.\n## How was this patch

PR adds a param to `ALS`/`ALSModel` to set the strategy used when encountering unknown users or items at prediction time in `transform`. This can occur in 2 scenarios: (a) production scoring, and (b) cross-validation & evaluation.\n\nThe current behavior returns `NaN` if a user/item is unknown. In scenario (b), this can easily occur when using `CrossValidator` or `TrainValidationSplit` since some users/items may only occur in the test set and not in the training set. In this case, the evaluator returns `NaN` for all metrics, making model selection impossible.\n\nThe new param, `coldStartStrategy`, defaults to `nan` (the current behavior). The other option supported initially is `drop`, which drops all rows with `NaN` predictions. This flag allows users to use `ALS` in cross-validation settings. It is made an `expertParam`. The param is made a string so that the set of strategies can be extended in future (some options are discussed in [SPARK-14489](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-14489)).\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nNew unit tests, and manual \"before and after\" tests for Scala & Python using MovieLens `ml-latest-small` as example data. Here, using `CrossValidator` or `TrainValidationSplit` with the default param setting results in metrics that are all `NaN`, while setting `coldStartStrategy` to `drop` results in valid metrics.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWaiting #11956 to be merged.\n\nThis PR generates Java code to get a value of each compressed column from CachedBatch when DataFrame.cache() is called. This is done in whole stage code generation.\n\nWhen DataFrame.cache() is called, data is stored as column-oriented storage (columnar cache) in CachedBatch. This PR avoid conversion from column-oriented storage to row-oriented storage. This PR handles several primitive types (boolean/byte/short/int/long) that may be stored into a column witha compressed data format. \n\nThis PR consists of two parts.\n1. Pass data in CachedBatch to generated code by using `decompress()` method. CachedBatch consists of multiple ByteBuffer arrays. A ByteBuffer may have compressed data. If the array is compressed, decompress it and pass it to generated code. If the array is not compressed, it is just passed to generated code.\n2. Generate code both for row-oriented storage and column-oriented storage only if\n   - InMemoryColumnarTableScan exists in a plan sub-tree. A decision is performed by checking an given iterator is ColumnaIterator at runtime\n   - Sort or join does not exist in a plan sub-tree. \n\nThis PR generates Java code for columnar cache only if types in all columns, which are accessed in operations, are primitive\n\nThis PR improves performance of aggregate sum by 2.0x - 5.2x. This benchmark is available at [here](https://github.com/kiszk/spark/blob/SPARK-14098/sql/core/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/DataFrameCacheBenchmark.scala)\n\nPerformance results:\n\n```\nJava

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently when we create an alias against a TypedColumn from user-defined Aggregator(for example: agg(aggSum.toColumn as \"a\")), spark is using the alias' function from Column( as), the alias function will return a column contains a TypedAggregateExpression, which is unresolved because the inputDeserializer is not defined. Later the aggregator function (agg) will inject the inputDeserializer back to the TypedAggregateExpression, but only if the aggregate columns are TypedColumn, in the above case, the TypedAggregateExpression will remain unresolved because it is under column and caused the \nproblem reported by this jira [15051](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-15051?jql=project%20%3D%20SPARK).\n\nThis PR propose to create an alias function for TypedColumn,  it will return a TypedColumn. It is using the similar code path  as Column's alia function. \n\nFor the spark build in aggregate function, like max, it is working with alias, for example\n\nval df1 = Seq(1 -> \"a\", 2 -> \"b\", 3 -> \"b\").toDF(\"i\", \"j\")\ncheckAnswer(df1.agg(max(\"j\") as \"b\"), Row(3) :: Nil)\n\nThanks for comments.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\n(Please explain how this patch was tested. E.g. unit tests, integration tests, manual tests)\n\nAdd test cases in DatasetAggregatorSuite.scala\nrun the sql related queries against this

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWe currently have a single suite that is very large, making it difficult to maintain and play with specific primitives. This patch reorganizes the file by creating multiple benchmark suites in a single package.\n\nMost of the changes are straightforward move of code. On top of the code moving, I did:\n1. Use SparkSession instead of SQLContext.\n2. Turned most benchmark scenarios into a their own test cases, rather than having multiple scenarios in a single test case, which takes forever to run.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nThis is a test only change.\n","created_at":"2016-05-04T08:18:48Z","updated_at":"2016-05-04T19:37:04Z","closed_at":"2016-05-04T18:01:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4dbcdf41c48a18678c96341def4ac9fce5f6e785","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12891/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12891/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12891/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b65505b7e6e9098a3b06478252f7095d57405d31","head":{"label":"rxin:SPARK-15115","ref":"SPARK-15115","sha":"b65505b7e6e9098a3b06478252f7095d57405d31","user":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17192644,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE5MjY0NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"rxin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rxin/spark","description":"Mirror

The problem is, if we create `SparkContext` first and then call `SparkSession.builder.enableHiveSupport().getOrCreate()`, we will reuse the existing `SparkContext` and the hive flag won't be set.\n##

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis patch changes our micro-benchmark util to allow setting different iteration numbers for different test cases. For some of our benchmarks, turning off whole-stage codegen can make the runtime 20X slower, making it very difficult to run a large number of times without substantially shortening the input cardinality.\n\nWith this change, I set the default num iterations to 2 for whole stage codegen off, and 5 for whole stage codegen on. I also updated some results.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nN/A - this is a test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nFile Stream Sink writes the list of written files in a metadata log. StreamFileCatalog reads the list of the files for processing. However StreamFileCatalog does not infer partitioning like HDFSFileCatalog.\n\nThis PR enables that by refactoring HDFSFileCatalog to create an abstract class PartitioningAwareFileCatalog, that has all the functionality to infer partitions from a list of leaf files. \n- HDFSFileCatalog has been renamed to ListingFileCatalog and it extends PartitioningAwareFileCatalog by providing a list of leaf files from recursive directory scanning. \n- StreamFileCatalog has been renamed to MetadataLogFileCatalog and it extends PartitioningAwareFileCatalog by providing a list of leaf files from the metadata log.\n- The above two classes has been moved into their own files as they are not interfaces that should be in fileSourceInterfaces.scala.\n## How was this patch tested?\n- FileStreamSinkSuite was update to see if partitioning gets inferred, and on reading whether the partitions get pruned correctly based on the query. \n- Other unit tests are unchanged and pass as

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWe currently use the Hive implementations for the collect_list/collect_set aggregate functions. This has a few major drawbacks: the use of HiveUDAF (which has quite a bit of overhead) and the lack of support for struct datatypes. This PR adds native implementation of these functions to Spark.\n\nThe size of the collected list/set may vary, this means we cannot use the fast, Tungsten, aggregation path to perform the aggregation, and that we fallback to the slower sort based path. Another big issue with these operators is that when the size of the collected list/set grows too large, we can start experiencing large GC pauzes and OOMEs.\n\nThis `collect*` aggregates implemented in this PR rely on the sort based aggregate path for correctness. They maintain their own internal buffer which holds the rows for one group at a time. The sortbased aggregation path is triggered by disabling `partialAggregation` for these aggregates (which is kinda funny); this technique is also employed in `org.apache.spark.sql.hiveHiveUDAFFunction`.\n\nI have done some performance testing:\n\n``` scala\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.{Dataset, Row}\n\nsql(\"create function collect_list2 as 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.udf.generic.GenericUDAFCollectList'\")\n\nval df = range(0, 10000000).select($\"id\", (rand(213123L) * 100000).cast(\"int\").as(\"grp\"))\ndf.select(countDistinct($\"grp\")).show\n\ndef benchmark(name: String, plan: Dataset[Row], maxItr: Int = 5): Unit = {\n   // Do not measure planning.\n   plan1.queryExecution.executedPlan\n\n   // Execute the plan a number of times and average the result.\n   val start = System.nanoTime\n   var i = 0\n   while (i < maxItr) {\n     plan.rdd.foreach(row => Unit)\n     i += 1\n   }\n   val time = (System.nanoTime - start) / (maxItr * 1000000L)\n   println(s\"[$name] $maxItr iterations completed in an average time of $time ms.\")\n}\n\nval plan1 = df.groupBy($\"grp\").agg(collect_list($\"id\"))\nval plan2 = df.groupBy($\"grp\").agg(callUDF(\"collect_list2\", $\"id\"))\n\nbenchmark(\"Spark collect_list\", plan1)\n...\n> [Spark collect_list] 5 iterations completed in an average time of 3371 ms.\n\nbenchmark(\"Hive collect_list\", plan2)\n...\n> [Hive collect_list] 5 iterations completed in an average time of 9109 ms.\n```\n\nPerformance is improved by a factor 2-3.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded tests to

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently, various `FileFormat` data sources share approximately the same code for partition value appending. This PR tries to eliminate this duplication.\n\nA new method `buildReaderWithPartitionValues()` is added to `FileFormat` with a default implementation that appends partition values to `InternalRow`s produced by the reader function returned by `buildReader()`.\n\nSpecial data sources like Parquet, which implements partition value appending inside `buildReader()` because of the vectorized reader, and the Text data source, which doesn't support partitioning, override `buildReaderWithPartitionValues()` and simply delegate to `buildReader()`.\n\nThis PR brings two benefits:\n1. Apparently, it de-duplicates partition value appending logic\n2. Now the reader function returned by `buildReader()` is only required to produce `InternalRow`s rather than `UnsafeRow`s if the data source doesn't override `buildReaderWithPartitionValues()`.\n   \n   Because the safe-to-unsafe conversion is also performed while appending partition values. This makes 3rd-party data sources (e.g. spark-avro) easier to implement since they no longer need to access private APIs involving `UnsafeRow`.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting tests should do the work.\n","created_at":"2016-05-03T11:10:31Z","updated_at":"2016-05-04T16:32:24Z","closed_at":"2016-05-04T06:18:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"89d4f5f0ef149ca6f7b701a8b29e3ec06ef00557","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12866/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12866/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12866/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1bce7db0c67fd4031377f16ce0e7be7ddbfd4da3","head":{"label":"liancheng:spark-14237-simplify-partition-values-appending","ref":"spark-14237-simplify-partition-values-appending","sha":"1bce7db0c67fd4031377f16ce0e7be7ddbfd4da3","user":{"login":"liancheng","id":230655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng","html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17232535,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzMjUzNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"liancheng/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"liancheng","id":230655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng","html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently, `INSERT INTO` with `GROUP BY` query tries to make at least 200 files (default value of `spark.sql.shuffle.partition`), which results in lots of empty files.\n\nThis PR makes it avoid creating empty files during overwriting into Hive table and in internal data sources  with group by query.\n\nThis checks whether the given partition has data in it or not and creates/writes file only when it actually has data.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnittests in `InsertIntoHiveTableSuite` and `HadoopFsRelationTest`. \n\nCloses #8411\n","created_at":"2016-05-03T01:29:16Z","updated_at":"2018-01-02T03:40:18Z","closed_at":"2016-05-17T18:20:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1d8fb7914e6eaa6c5a7f5ba3d56a74ebdf1afd45","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12855/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12855/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12855/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5f780a7ba60b2f0518897a9a369d27455cab47cb","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:pr/8411","ref":"pr/8411","sha":"5f780a7ba60b2f0518897a9a369d27455cab47cb","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nFlumePollingStreamSuite contains two tests which run for a minute each. This seems excessively slow and we should speed it up if possible.\n\nIn this PR, instead of creating `StreamingContext` directly from `conf`, here an underlying `SparkContext` is created before all and it is used to create  each`StreamingContext`. \n\nRunning time is reduced by avoiding multiple `SparkContext` creations and destroys.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nTested on my local machine

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCompared with the current Spark parser, there are two extra syntax are supported in Hive for sampling\n- In `On` clauses, `rand()` is used for indicating sampling on the entire row instead of an individual column. For example, \n  \n  ``` SQL\n  SELECT * FROM source TABLESAMPLE(BUCKET 3 OUT OF 32 ON rand()) s;\n  ```\n- Users can specify the total length to be read. For example, \n  \n  ``` SQL\n  SELECT * FROM source TABLESAMPLE(100M) s;\n  ```\n\nBelow is the link for references:\n   https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+Sampling\n\nThis PR is to parse and capture these two extra syntax, and issue a better error message.\n#### How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded test cases to verify the thrown exceptions\n","created_at":"2016-05-02T07:45:36Z","updated_at":"2016-05-04T01:40:54Z","closed_at":"2016-05-03T21:22:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fd18daff3b59681ad390545bcbdd24e5cfa2d0ef","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12838/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12838/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12838/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5b8a8488faa40d2a983562194009caff99520729","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:bucketOnRand","ref":"bucketOnRand","sha":"5b8a8488faa40d2a983562194009caff99520729","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

[SPARK-3190] and https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/2106 described, VertexRDDs  with more than 4 billion elements are counted incorrectly due to integer overflow when summing partition sizes. \nAnd the PR above expected to fix the issue by converting partition sizes to Longs before summing them. But when the number of vertices in specific partition exceed Integer.MAX_VALUE also can repreduce this issue.\nThe fundamental cause of this problem is the variable “size” is defined as type Int in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis patch creates a builder pattern for creating SparkSession. The new code is unused and mostly deadcode. I'm putting it up here for feedback.\n\nThere are a few TODOs that can be done as follow-up pull requests:\n- [ ] Update tests to use this\n- [ ] Update examples to use this\n- [ ] Clean up SQLContext code w.r.t. this one (i.e. SparkSession shouldn't call into SQLContext.getOrCreate; it should be the other way around)\n- [ ] Remove SparkSession.withHiveSupport\n- [ ] Disable the old constructor (by making it private) so the only way to start a SparkSession is through this builder pattern\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nPart of the future pull request is to clean this up and switch existing tests to use this.\n","created_at":"2016-05-02T03:49:01Z","updated_at":"2016-05-04T03:39:34Z","closed_at":"2016-05-02T22:29:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7fa309be390827d84f04aee1c8f77c6f84a9195a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12830/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12830/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12830/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0005a3deb8292c93b4e699abd922f12ad2606c45","head":{"label":"rxin:sparksession-builder","ref":"sparksession-builder","sha":"0005a3deb8292c93b4e699abd922f12ad2606c45","user":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17192644,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE5MjY0NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"rxin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rxin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWhen we load a dataset, if we set the path to `/path/a=1`, we will not take `a` as the partitioning column. However, if we set the path to `/path/a=1/file.parquet`, we take `a` as the partitioning column and it shows up in the schema. \n\nThis PR is to fix the behavior inconsistency issue.\n\nThe base path contains a set of paths that are considered as the base dirs of the input datasets. The partitioning discovery logic will make sure it will stop when it reaches any base path.\n\nBy default, the paths of the dataset provided by users will be base paths. Below are three typical cases,\n**Case 1**`sqlContext.read.parquet(\"/path/something=true/\")`: the base path will be\n`/path/something=true/`, and the returned DataFrame will not contain a column of `something`.\n**Case 2**`sqlContext.read.parquet(\"/path/something=true/a.parquet\")`: the base path will be\nstill `/path/something=true/`, and the returned DataFrame will also not contain a column of\n`something`.\n**Case 3**`sqlContext.read.parquet(\"/path/\")`: the base path will be `/path/`, and the returned\nDataFrame will have the column of `something`.\n\nUsers also can override the basePath by setting `basePath` in the options to pass the new base\npath to the data source. For example, \n`sqlContext.read.option(\"basePath\", \"/path/\").parquet(\"/path/something=true/\")`,\nand the returned DataFrame will have the column of `something`.\n\nThe related PRs: \n-
