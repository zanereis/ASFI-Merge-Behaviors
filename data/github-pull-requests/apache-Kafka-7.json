PR implements the second part of KIP-996 and KAFKA-16164 (tasks KAFKA-16607, KAFKA-17642, KAFKA-17643, KAFKA-17675) which encompass the response handling of PreVotes, addition of new ProspectiveState, update to metrics, and addition of Raft simulation tests. \r\n\r\nThe first part of KIP-996 is covered by KAFKA-17641: Update Vote RPC with PreVote field #17807\r\n\r\nThe details can be found in KIP-996 but a summary of the changes follows:\r\n- Voters now transition to ProspectiveState first before CandidateState to prevent unnecessary epoch bumps. Voters in ProspectiveState send PreVotes which are Vote requests with PreVote=true.\r\n- Follower grants PreVotes if it has not yet fetched successfully from leader. Leader denies all PreVotes. Unattached, Prospective, Candidate, and Resigned will grant PreVotes if the requesting replica's log is at least as long as theirs. Granted PreVotes are not persisted like standard votes. It is possible for a voter to grant several PreVotes.\r\n- The only state which is allowed to transition directly to CandidateState is ProspectiveState. This happens on reception of majority of granted PreVotes. \r\n- Prospective will transition to Follower after election loss/timeout if it was already aware of last known leader, or at any point if it discovers the leader (same epoch or higher)\r\n- Prospective will transition to Unattached after election loss/timeout if it does not discover leader endpoints\r\n- After electionTimeout, Resigned now always transitions to Unattached with epoch + 1.\r\n- Prospective grants standard votes if it has not already granted a standard vote (no votedKey), has no leaderId, and the recipient's log is current enough\r\n- Candidate no longer backs off after election timeout. (It still backs off after election loss)\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2024-12-18T00:02:14Z","updated_at":"2025-01-17T14:38:04Z","closed_at":"2025-01-17T14:38:04Z","merged_at":"2025-01-17T14:38:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"4583b033f03043e53d4c2a867ffe6188d143935d","assignee":{"login":"jsancio","id":794394,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDM5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/794394?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio","html_url":"https://github.com/jsancio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"jsancio","id":794394,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDM5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/794394?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio","html_url":"https://github.com/jsancio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":838330122,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MzgzMzAxMjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/core","name":"core","color":"ed5a86","default":false,"description":"Kafka

request to implement KIP-1111, aims to add a configuration that prevents a Kafka Streams application from starting if any of its internal topics have auto-generated names, thereby enforcing explicit naming for all internal topics and enhancing the stability of the application’s topology.\r\n\r\n- Repartition Topics:\r\n\r\nAll repartition topics are created in the KStreamImpl.createRepartitionedSource(...) static method. This method either receives a name explicitly provided by the user or null and then builds the final repartition topic name.\r\n\r\n- Changelog Topics and State Store Names:\r\n\r\nThere are several scenarios where these are created:\r\n  In the MaterializedInternal constructor.\r\n  During KStream/KStream joins.\r\n  During KStream/KTable joins with grace periods.\r\n  With key-value buffers are

in this change:\r\n1. Remove deprecated protocol api versions from json files.\r\n3. Remove fields that are no longer used from json files (affects ListOffsets, OffsetCommit, DescribeConfigs).\r\n4. Remove record down-conversion support from KafkaApis.\r\n5. No longer return `Errors.UNSUPPORTED_COMPRESSION_TYPE` on the fetch path[1].\r\n6. Deprecate `TopicConfig. MESSAGE_DOWNCONVERSION_ENABLE_CONFIG` and made the relevant\r\nconfigs (`message.downconversion.enable` and `log.message.downcoversion.enable`) no-ops since\r\ndown-conversion is no longer supported. It was an oversight not to deprecate this via KIP-724.\r\n7. Fix `shouldRetainsBufferReference` to handle null request schemas for a given version.\r\n8. Simplify producer logic since it only supports the v2 record format now.\r\n9. Fix tests so they don't exercise protocol api versions that have been removed.\r\n10. Add upgrade note.\r\n\r\nTesting:\r\n1. System tests have a lot of failures, but those tests fail for trunk too and I didn't see any issues specific to this change - it's hard to be sure given the number of failing tests, but let's not block on that given the other testing that has been done (see below).\r\n3. Java producers and consumers with version 0.9-0.10.1 don't have api versions support and hence they fail in an ungraceful manner: the broker disconnects and the clients reconnect until the relevant timeout is triggered.\r\n4. Same thing seems to happen for the console producer 0.10.2 although it's unclear why since api versions should be supported. I will look into this separately, it's unlikely to be related to this PR.\r\n5. Console consumer 0.10.2 fails with the expected error and a reasonable message[2].\r\n6. Console producer and consumer 0.11.0 works fine, newer versions should naturally also work fine.\r\n7. kcat 1.5.0 (based on librdkafka 1.1.0) produce and consume fail with a reasonable message[3][4].\r\n8. kcat 1.6.0-1.7.0 (based on librdkafka 1.5.0 and 1.7.0 respectively) consume fails with a reasonable message[5].\r\n9. kcat 1.6.0-1.7.0 produce works fine.\r\n10. kcat 1.7.1  (based on librdkafka 1.8.2) works fine for consumer and produce.\r\n11. confluent-go-client (librdkafka based) 1.8.2 works fine for consumer and produce.\r\n12. I will test more clients, but I don't think we need to block the PR on that.\r\n\r\nNote that this also completes part of KIP-724: produce v2 and lower as well as fetch v3 and lower are no longer supported.\r\n\r\nFuture PRs will remove conditional code that is no longer needed (some of that has been done in KafkaApis,\r\nbut only what was required due to the schema changes). We can probably do that in master only as it does\r\nnot change behavior.\r\n\r\nNote that I did not touch `ignorable` fields even though some of them could have been\r\nchanged. The reasoning is that this could result in incompatible changes for clients\r\nthat use new protocol versions without setting such fields _if_ we don't manually\r\nvalidate their presence. I will file a JIRA ticket to look into this carefully for each\r\ncase (i.e. if we do validate their presence for the appropriate versions, we can\r\nset them to ignorable=false in the json file).\r\n\r\n[1] We would return this error if a fetch < v10 was used and the compression topic config was set\r\nto zstd, but we would not do the same for the case where zstd was compressed at the producer\r\nlevel (the most common case). Since there is no efficient way to do the check for the common\r\ncase, I made it consistent for both by having no checks.\r\n[2] ```org.apache.kafka.common.errors.UnsupportedVersionException: The broker is too new to support JOIN_GROUP version 1```\r\n[3]```METADATA|rdkafka#producer-1| [thrd:main]: localhost:9092/bootstrap: Metadata request failed: connected: Local: Required feature not supported by broker (0ms): Permanent```\r\n[4]```METADATA|rdkafka#consumer-1| [thrd:main]: localhost:9092/bootstrap: Metadata request failed: connected: Local: Required feature not supported by broker

records from the offset topic has several corner\r\ncases, that we need to take care of. In particular, due to\r\ncompaction it can happen that we only see the tombstone\r\nrecord of a member or the group, but not the original record\r\nof the group. Similarly, if the group metadata record is\r\nupdated after the last update to the current assignment\r\nrecord of a member, the records will be replayed out of order,\r\nthat is, we first replay the current assignment of the member,\r\nand then create the group.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we need to change the code to always create groups\r\nwhen replaying any kind of records (instead of failing, as before).\r\nAlso, tombstones of non-existing groups are ignored.\r\n\r\nThis change also adds unit tests for all replay methods for streams\r\nrecords.\r\n\r\nWe also piggyback some changes to streamsGroupHeartbeat:\r\n - the structure of the method is cleaned up a bit\r\n - request validation is extended\r\n - unit test for request validation is extendend\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist

have observed the below errors in some cluster:\r\n\r\nUncaught exception in scheduled task 'handleTxnCompletion-902667' exception.message:Trying to complete a transactional offset commit for producerId *** and groupId *** even though the offset commit record itself hasn't been appended to the log.\r\n\r\nWhen a transaction is completed, the transaction coordinator sends a WriteTxnMarkers request to all the partitions involved in the transaction to write the markers to them. When the broker receives it, it writes the markers and if markers are written to the __consumer_offsets partitions, it informs the group coordinator that it can materialize the pending transactional offsets in its main cache. The group coordinator does this asynchronously since Apache Kafka 2.0, see this patch.\r\n\r\nThe above error appends when the asynchronous operation is executed by the scheduler and the operation finds that there are pending transactional offsets that were not written yet. How come?\r\n\r\nThere is actually an issue is the steps described above. The group coordinator does not wait until the asynchronous operation completes to return to the api layer. Hence the WriteTxnMarkers response may be send back to the transaction coordinator before the async operation is actually completed. Hence it is possible that the next transactional produce to be started also before the operation is completed too. This could explain why the group coordinator has pending transactional offsets that are not written yet.\r\n\r\nThere is a similar issue when the transaction is aborted. However on this path, we don't have any checks to verify whether all the pending transactional offsets have been written or not so we don't see any errors in our logs. Due to the same race condition, it is possible to actually remove the wrong pending transactional offsets.\r\n\r\nPS: The new group coordinator is not impacted by this bug.\r\n\r\nReviewers: Justine

has many issues in using kraft.\r\n\r\n1. it passes `unclean.leader.election.enable` as server config but it is not configured on controller node. We should set that config to topic while creating topic.\r\n\r\n2. ~~it assumes `topic` is distributed on [0, 1]. If the order is not correct, the test can't pass. We should create the topic manually to ensure the distribution.~~ The re-election is significantly small to the producer timeout, so I think we can ignore this here.\r\n\r\n3. ~~in kraft mode, the time to trigger unclean election is 5 mins. it is too long to wait. We should configure controller to reduce the number.~~ `unclean.leader.election.interval.ms` is merely a periodic task that scans for topic partitions without a leader and, based on the value of `unclean.leader.election.enable`(topic's || cluster's), determines whether to perform unclean leader elections for those partitions.\r\n","created_at":"2024-12-13T19:31:18Z","updated_at":"2025-01-09T17:02:35Z","closed_at":"2025-01-09T17:02:34Z","merged_at":"2025-01-09T17:02:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"a116753cc820d42e4b4dc5b248caed0f05c379d9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":838330122,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MzgzMzAxMjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/core","name":"core","color":"ed5a86","default":false,"description":"Kafka

have observed the below errors in some cluster:\r\n\r\n```\r\nUncaught exception in scheduled task 'handleTxnCompletion-902667' exception.message:Trying to complete a transactional offset commit for producerId *** and groupId *** even though the offset commit record itself hasn't been appended to the log.\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen a transaction is completed, the transaction coordinator sends a WriteTxnMarkers request to all the partitions involved in the transaction to write the markers to them. When the broker receives it, it writes the markers and if markers are written to the __consumer_offsets partitions, it informs the group coordinator that it can materialize the pending transactional offsets in its main cache. The group coordinator does this asynchronously since Apache Kafka 2.0, see this [patch](https://github.com/apache/kafka/commit/c53e274d3128bc92f0e8b6a79c407cf764f16f7b).\r\n\r\nThe above error appends when the asynchronous operation is executed by the scheduler and the operation finds that there are pending transactional offsets that were not written yet. How come?\r\n\r\nThere is actually an issue is the steps described above. The group coordinator does not wait until the asynchronous operation completes to return to the api layer. Hence the WriteTxnMarkers response may be send back to the transaction coordinator before the async operation is actually completed. Hence it is possible that the next transactional produce to be started also before the operation is completed too. This could explain why the group coordinator has pending transactional offsets that are not written yet.\r\n\r\nThere is a similar issue when the transaction is aborted. However on this path, we don't have any checks to verify whether all the pending transactional offsets have been written or not so we don't see any errors in our logs. Due to the same race condition, it is possible to actually remove the wrong pending transactional offsets.\r\n\r\nPS: The new group coordinator is not impacted by this bug.\r\n\r\n### Committer

admin client starts up, it'll get the metadata of the cluster. And when the admin client sends request directly to the controller (via --bootstrap-controller), it'll send the request to the active controller. But if there is a leadership change in the controller after the metadata request and before the target request sent, the request will fail immediately with NOT_CONTROLLER error or NOT_LEADER_OR_FOLLOWER error. It's because the requests that need metadata log change must need to do on the active controller. Instead of failing immediately, the admin client should catch the error and retry the metadata update to send the request again. Note, in some application, the admin client could exist for a long time to send multiple requests when needed, this case could happen more often.\r\n\r\nTake `describeMetadataQuorum` for example, we'll use `LeastLoadedBrokerOrActiveKController`([here](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/ad79b4afa779a2a577358787096b4fe016e2d67e/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/clients/admin/KafkaAdminClient.java#L4604)) to get the active controller via describeCluster/Metadata API, then send `describeMetadataQuorum` to the active controller. You can see, it's possible that the active controller changed right after `describeCluster/Metadata` call and before `describeMetadataQuorum` call, and even worse if the application creates an long running adminClient to handle any calls in the lifecycle. And you can see how we handle the `describeMetadataQuorum` response [here](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/ad79b4afa779a2a577358787096b4fe016e2d67e/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/clients/admin/KafkaAdminClient.java#L4654). We don't handle `NOT_CONTROLLER` nor `NOT_LEADER_OR_FOLLOWER` errors. The error response will look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nDescribeQuorumResponseData(errorCode=0, errorMessage='', topics=[TopicData(topicName='__cluster_metadata', partitions=[PartitionData(partitionIndex=0, errorCode=6, errorMessage='For requests intended only for the leader, this error indicates that the broker is not the current leader. For requests intended for any replica, this error indicates that the broker is not a replica of the topic partition.', leaderId=0, leaderEpoch=0, highWatermark=0, currentVoters=[], observers=[])])], nodes=[])\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince the NOT_LEADER_OR_FOLLOWER and NOT_CONTROLLER are both retriable errors, when receiving them, the admin client will keep retrying until request time out or metadata expired in config metadata.max.age.ms (default is 5 mins).\r\n\r\nComparably, when we invoke [createTopic](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/ad79b4afa779a2a577358787096b4fe016e2d67e/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/clients/admin/KafkaAdminClient.java#L1848), deleteTopic, alterPartitionReassignment, ... we'll invoke `handleNotControllerError` to handle controller change, because we know when brokers receive these calls, they will forward to the active controller, but when there's controller leadership change, we need to re-fetch the metadata and retry. \r\n\r\nPlease note that when talking directly to the controller, we might get `NOT_LEADER_OR_FOLLOWER`( ex: [here](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/ad79b4afa779a2a577358787096b4fe016e2d67e/raft/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/raft/KafkaRaftClient.java#L1848)) because in the controller quorum's perspective, this controller is not a leader. That's why I added this in `handleNotControllerError`:\r\n`metadataManager.usingBootstrapControllers() && response.errorCounts().containsKey(Errors.NOT_LEADER_OR_FOLLOWER))`\r\n\r\nI think this is just a miss when we were implementing [KIP-919: Allow AdminClient to Talk Directly with the KRaft Controller Quorum](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-919%3A+Allow+AdminClient+to+Talk+Directly+with+the+KRaft+Controller+Quorum+and+add+Controller+Registration). And that's why in this PR, I handled `NOT_CONTROLLER` and `NOT_LEADER_OR_FOLLOWER` not just for `describeMetadataQuorum`, but also for the requests that talk to controller directly, and the request must need the active controller to handle (ex: controller will modify the metadata log,  requesting raft update,...). The APIs are:\r\n   1. createAcls\r\n   2. deleteAcls\r\n   3. alterConfigs\r\n   4. describeMetadataQuorum\r\n   5. addRaftVoter\r\n   6. removeRaftVoter\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded

We have implemented the share state batch combining logic in `PersisterStateBatchCombiner` and it can be broken into 2 parts - batch pruning (based on start offset) and overlapping batch combination.\r\n* While batch pruning is a simple `O(n)` operation, combination is `O(nlogn)` with additional overhead of `TreeSet`.\r\n* It can be observed that the read and write RPC caller will only receive batches from the coordinator when they issue a read state call. Additionally, writes are very frequent compared to reads which happen only on share partition initialization.\r\n* In light of above points, we can trade memory for better running time.\r\n* In this PR we have done some tuning to the combine logic which is as follows:\r\n  * Allow `PersisterStateBatchCombiner` to combine batches with only pruning (using a boolean argument as flag).\r\n  * For share update calls (much more frequent than share snapshot - default 500 per snapshot), batch combining happens with prune only.\r\n  * For share snapshot calls combining happens with deep merging.\r\n  * For read calls combining happens with deep merging.\r\n  * For replay calls for share update, merging is prune only while for snapshot, no merging is required\r\n  * There is a corner case when we receive a write RPC for the first time for a new share partition. In this we have chosen to go with prune only merging.\r\n* So, in light of these our compute is distributed such that frequent operations are fast while infrequent ones bear the burden of heavy lifting while minor pruning is done in all operations to optimize for memory. Overall we are saved from Frequent `TreeSet` initialization for sure.\r\n\r\n### Observed benefits (over 1 million records)\r\n* Without the change each write RPC averages ~13.44ms.\r\n* After change the avg time is ~13ms.\r\n* It might seem like a small win but considering that write RPCs will run in 1000s, the numbers will add up.","created_at":"2024-12-12T07:44:12Z","updated_at":"2024-12-12T09:12:51Z","closed_at":"2024-12-12T09:12:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"071c861b6c290fb45261980184d4f7a5c7376a09","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":6979675393,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABoAVlAQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/KIP-932","name":"KIP-932","color":"DA462F","default":false,"description":"Queues

[KAFKA-18073](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-18073)\r\n\r\nIf any operation on a record (e.g., convert record fails due to connectivity issue to Schema Registry, transform record fails) results in a retriable exception that exceeds its retry configuration (default is no retries) then even with errors.tolerance set to None (the default) we will still drop the record. This causes silent & unexpected data loss by default for any Kafka Connect source or sink connector. We should prevent this and fail loudly and not drop records if a retriable exception fails.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\nIn order to fix this for source/sink connectors, we fix the logic in RetryWithToleranceOperator operator. Specifically, if a RetriableException can no longer be retried, we either return null (skip) or raise an exception based on the error tolerance.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nIn AbstractWorkerSourceTaskTest, add several new tests for the different logical branches depending on errorrs.tolerance & whether convert or transform succeed/fail. We provide a way to avoid mocking the transformationChain so that the underlying retryWithToleranceOperator is used. Although this expands the scope of the logic tested, it is intentional & beneficial, as these mocks prevented this critical bug from being discovered earlier.\r\n\r\nAlso add similar tests in the worker sink task tests.\r\n\r\nAlso add tests in RetryWithToleranceOperatorTest for some additional cases of none vs. all. Refactor some unclear naming.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2024-12-11T18:42:53Z","updated_at":"2025-01-09T18:13:12Z","closed_at":"2025-01-09T18:13:11Z","merged_at":"2025-01-09T18:13:11Z","merge_commit_sha":"b35c29401acb12c7a2b8a450c5164cddf82361c6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":851037639,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTEwMzc2Mzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/connect","name":"connect","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":""},{"id":7522931565,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABwGbTbQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/ci-approved","name":"ci-approved","color":"ffffff","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/18146/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/18146/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/18146/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/700be75488e47761d3f17b57f62dd243733aa662","head":{"label":"twthorn:KAFKA-18073","ref":"KAFKA-18073","sha":"700be75488e47761d3f17b57f62dd243733aa662","user":{"login":"twthorn","id":8137651,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMzc2NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8137651?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/twthorn","html_url":"https://github.com/twthorn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twthorn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twthorn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twthorn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twthorn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twthorn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twthorn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twthorn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twthorn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twthorn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":892844147,"node_id":"R_kgDONTe4cw","name":"kafka","full_name":"twthorn/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"twthorn","id":8137651,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMzc2NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8137651?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/twthorn","html_url":"https://github.com/twthorn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twthorn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twthorn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twthorn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twthorn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twthorn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twthorn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twthorn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twthorn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twthorn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/twthorn/kafka","description":"Mirror
