What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR is to fix the `UnsupportedOperationException` described in [PR#32705](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/32705).\r\nWhen AQE and DPP are turned on at the same time, because the `BroadcastExchange` included in the DPP filter is not added through `EnsureRequirement` rule, Therefore, when AQE optimizes the DPP filter, there is no way to add `BroadcastExchange` through the `EnsureRequirement` rule in `reOptimize` method, which eventually leads to the loss of `BroadcastExchange` in the final physical plan. This PR adds `BroadcastExchange` node in the `reOptimize` method if the current plan is DPP filter.\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nbug fix\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR adds rules to `checkstyle.xml` and `scalastyle-config.xml` to avoid introducing `Objects.toStringHelper` a Guava's API which is no longer present in newer Guava.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nSPARK-30272 (#26911) replaced `Objects.toStringHelper` which is an APIs Guava 14 provides with `commons.lang3` API because `Objects.toStringHelper` is no longer present in newer Guava.\r\nBut toStringHelper was introduced into Spark again and replaced them in SPARK-35420 (#32567).\r\nI think it's better to have a style rule to avoid such repetition.\r\n\r\nSPARK-30272 replaced some APIs aside from `Objects.toStringHelper` but `Objects.toStringHelper` seems to affect Spark for now so I add rules only for it.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nI confirmed that `lint-java` and `lint-scala` detect the usage of `toStringHelper` and let the lint check fail.\r\n```\r\n$ dev/lint-java\r\nexec: curl --silent --show-error -L https://downloads.lightbend.com/scala/2.12.14/scala-2.12.14.tgz\r\nUsing `mvn` from path: /opt/maven/3.6.3//bin/mvn\r\nCheckstyle checks failed at following occurrences:\r\n[ERROR] src/main/java/org/apache/spark/network/protocol/OneWayMessage.java:[78] (regexp) RegexpSinglelineJava: Avoid using Object.toStringHelper.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nBefore creating executor pods, wait until the driver pod is ready.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe driver's headless service can be resolved by DNS only after the driver pod is ready. If the executor tries to connect to the headless service before driver pod is ready, it will hit UnkownHostException and get into error state but will not be restarted. **This case usually happens when the driver pod has sidecar containers but hasn't finished their creation when executors start**. So basically there is a race condition.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisiting tests.\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n","created_at":"2021-06-02T06:41:19Z","updated_at":"2022-02-18T06:46:55Z","closed_at":"2021-06-02T07:11:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"07f81dc63acbe34b896cf92611882340f2acdaed","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605057,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/KUBERNETES","name":"KUBERNETES","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32739/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32739/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/32739/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/612ba0e0018378204bd5eebeec8fe77c29659f72","head":{"label":"cchriswu:master","ref":"master","sha":"612ba0e0018378204bd5eebeec8fe77c29659f72","user":{"login":"cchriswu","id":34018436,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDE4NDM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34018436?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cchriswu","html_url":"https://github.com/cchriswu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cchriswu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cchriswu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cchriswu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cchriswu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cchriswu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cchriswu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cchriswu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cchriswu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cchriswu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"54e9999d39823c4fc236f328fe55e46607515cd0","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

The issue here is we check only the first row's Vector type. If the first row is dense and rest all the row's are sparse, we compute PCA based on dense path. Similarly, if only first row in Sparse and rest all the rows are dense, we compute based on Sparse computation path.\r\n\r\nFollowing datasets will produce different results with PCA, even though the data is same, except first row type is sparse.\r\n```\r\nval data1 = Array(\r\n  Vectors.sparse(5, Seq((1, 1.0), (3, 7.0))),\r\n  Vectors.dense(2.0, 0.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0),\r\n  Vectors.dense(4.0, 0.0, 0.0, 6.0, 7.0)\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n+-----------------------------------------------------------+\r\n|pcaFeatures                                                |\r\n+-----------------------------------------------------------+\r\n|[1.6485728230883807,-4.013282700516296,-5.524543751369388] |\r\n|[-4.645104331781534,-1.1167972663619026,-5.524543751369387]|\r\n|[-6.428880535676489,-5.337951427775355,-5.524543751369389] |\r\n+-----------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\n```\r\n```\r\nval data1 = Array(\r\n  Vectors.dense(0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 7.0, 0.0 ),\r\n  Vectors.dense(2.0, 0.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0),\r\n  Vectors.dense(4.0, 0.0, 0.0, 6.0, 7.0)\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n+------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n|pcaFeatures                                                 |\r\n+------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n|[1.6485728230883814,-4.0132827005162985,-1.0091435193998504]|\r\n|[-4.645104331781533,-1.1167972663619048,-1.0091435193998501]|\r\n|[-6.428880535676488,-5.337951427775359,-1.009143519399851]  |\r\n+------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8.

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nHighlyCompressedMapStatus supports record accurately the size of skewed shuffle block which small than spark.shuffle.accurateBlockThreshold.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nHighlyCompressedMapStatus currently cannot record accurately the size of shuffle blocks which much greater than other block but small than `spark.shuffle.accurateBlockThreshold`, which is likely to lead OOM when fetch shuffle blocks. We have to tune some extra properties like `spark.reducer.maxReqsInFlight` to prevent it, so it is better to fix it in HighlyCompressedMapStatus.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, a new config `spark.shuffle.accurateSkewedBlockThreshold` added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nPreviously, the following two commits allow driver-owned on-demand PVC reuse.\r\n- SPARK-35182 Support driver-owned on-demand PVC\r\n- SPARK-35416 Support PersistentVolumeClaim Reuse\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to recover the shuffle data on those remounted PVCs. The lifecycle of PVCs are tied to the one of Spark jobs. Since this is K8s specific feature, `ShuffleDataIO` plugin is used.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nAlthough Pod is killed, we can remount PVCs and recover some data from it.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the newly added test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes move missing JDBC data source options from Python, Scala and Java into a single page.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSo far, the documentation for JDBC data source options is separated into different pages for each language API documents. However, this makes managing many options inconvenient, so it is efficient to manage all options in a single page and provide a link to that page in the API of each language.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, the documents will be shown below after this change:\r\n\r\n- \"JDBC To Other Databases\" page\r\n<img width=\"803\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-06-02 at 11

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, we do not have a suitable definition of the `user` concept in Spark. We only have a `sparkUser` app widely but do not support identify or retrieve the user information from a session in STS or a runtime query execution.\r\n\r\n`current_user()` is very popular and supported by plenty of other modern or old school databases, and also ANSI compliant.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR add `current_user()`  as a SQL function. And, they are the same.  In this PR, we add these functions w/o ambiguity.\r\n1. For a normal single-threaded Spark application, clearly the `sparkUser` is always equivalent to `current_user()` .\r\n2. For a multi-threaded Spark application, e.g. Spark thrift server, we use a `ThreadLocal` variable to store the client-side user(after authenticated) before running the query and retrieve it in the parser.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`current_user()` is very popular and supported by plenty of other modern or old school databases, and also ANSI compliant.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nyes, added  `current_user()`  as a SQL function\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nnew tests in thrift server and

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR adds a unit test to show a bug in the latest janino version which fails to compile valid Java code. Unfortunately, I can't share the exact query that can trigger this bug (includes some custom expressions), but this pattern is not very uncommon and I believe can be triggered by some real queries.\r\n\r\nA follow-up is needed before the 3.2 release, to either fix this bug in janino, or revert the janino version upgrade, or work around it in Spark.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nmake it easy for people to debug janino, as I'm not a janino expert.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to support special datetime values introduced by #25708 and by #25716 only in typed literals, and don't recognize them in parsing strings to dates/timestamps. The following string values are supported only in typed timestamp literals:\r\n- `epoch [zoneId]` - `1970-01-01 00:00:00+00 (Unix system time zero)`\r\n- `today [zoneId]` - midnight today.\r\n- `yesterday [zoneId]` - midnight yesterday\r\n- `tomorrow [zoneId]` - midnight tomorrow\r\n- `now` - current query start time.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> SELECT timestamp 'tomorrow';\r\n2019-09-07 00:00:00\r\n```\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the following special date values are supported only in typed date literals:\r\n- `epoch [zoneId]` - `1970-01-01`\r\n- `today [zoneId]` - the current date in the time zone specified by `spark.sql.session.timeZone`.\r\n- `yesterday [zoneId]` - the current date -1\r\n- `tomorrow [zoneId]` - the current date + 1\r\n- `now` - the date of running the current query. It has the same notion as `today`.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> SELECT date 'tomorrow' - date 'yesterday';\r\n2\r\n``` \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn the current implementation, Spark supports the special date/timestamp value in any input strings casted to dates/timestamps that leads to the following problems:\r\n- If executors have different system time, the result is inconsistent, and random. Column values depend on where the conversions were performed.\r\n- The special values play the role of distributed non-deterministic functions though users might think of the values as constants. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes but the probability should be small.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running existing test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.SQLQueryTestSuite -- -z interval.sql\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.SQLQueryTestSuite -- -z date.sql\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.SQLQueryTestSuite -- -z timestamp.sql\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nHandle Currying Product while serializing TreeNode to JSON. While processing [Product](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/v3.1.2/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/trees/TreeNode.scala#L820), we may get an assert error for cases like Currying Product because of the mismatch of sizes between field name and field values.\r\nFallback to use reflection to get all the values for constructor parameters when we  meet such cases.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAvoid throwing error while serializing TreeNode to JSON, try to output as much information as possible.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew UT case

are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo recover the status update of GitHub Actions in PRs.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, dev-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThere are several pr to fix compilation warnings  related to `procedure syntax` like SPARK-29291， SPARK-33352 and SPARK-35526, in order to prevent the recurrence of similar problems, this pr add a compile arg to convert `procedure syntax` related compilation warnings to compilation errors in Scala 2.13.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nPrevent the recurrence of compilation warnings related to `procedure syntax is deprecated`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n`procedure syntax` is no longer allowed in Spark code with Scala 2.13, for constructors methods definition should be `this(...) = { }` not `this(...) { }`, for without  `return type` methods definition should be `def methodName(...): Unit = {}` not `def methodName(...) {}`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- Pass the GitHub Action Scala 2.13 job\r\n\r\n- Manual test：\r\n\r\nDo some code change

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to support R 4.1.0+ in SparkR. Currently the tests are being failed as below:\r\n\r\n```\r\n══ Failed ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\r\n── 1.

Failure (test_utils.R:80:3): cleanClosure on R functions ─────────────────\r\n`actual` not equal to `g`.\r\nnames for current but not for target\r\nLength mismatch: comparison on first 0 components\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt fixes three as below:\r\n\r\n- Avoid a sort on DataFrame which isn't legitimate: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/32709#discussion_r642458108\r\n- Treat the empty timezone and local timezone as equivalent in SparkR: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/32709#discussion_r642464454\r\n- Disable `check.environment` in the cleaned closure comparison (enabled by default from R 4.1+, https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/NEWS.html), and keep the test as is https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/32709#discussion_r642510089\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nHigher R versions have bug fixes and improvements. More importantly R users tend to use highest R versions.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, SparkR will work together with R 4.1.0+\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

the process of the company's business promotion, the function of k8s hostNetwork is used. But it is found that spark does not support enable hostNetwork in the configuration.\r\nFound that this function will still be commonly used, so I decided to add a perceptible parameter to enable hostNetwork in spark way.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nyes, add new config spark.kubernetes.executor.hostNetwork.enable\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nadd

It misses some nodes in almost all the TPCDS queries.\r\nIn this PR, we are collecting all the plan nodes including the subqueries and computing  the statistics for each node, if it doesn't exists in stats cache,\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n**Before Fix**\r\nFor eg: Query1,  Project node doesn't have statistics\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23054875/120123442-868feb00-c1cc-11eb-9af9-3a87bf2117d2.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nQuery15, Aggregate node doesn't have statistics\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23054875/120123296-a4108500-c1cb-11eb-89df-7fddd651572e.png)\r\n\r\n**After Fix:**

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis is a minor change to update how `StateStoreRestoreExec` computes its number of output rows.

Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2.

For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n`FileStreamSink` produces a metadata directory which logs output files per micro-batch. When we read from the output path, Spark will look at the metadata and ignore other files not in the log.\r\n\r\nNormally it works well. But for some use-cases, we may need to ignore the metadata when reading the output path. For example, when we change the streaming query and must to run it with new checkpoint directory, we cannot use previous metadata. If we create a new metadata too, when we read the output path later in Spark, Spark only reads the files listed in the new metadata. The files written before we use new checkpoint and metadata are ignored by Spark.\r\n\r\nAlthough seems we can output to different output directory every time, but it is bad idea as we will produce many directories unnecessarily.\r\n\r\nWe need a config for ignoring the metadata of `FileStreamSink` when reading the output path.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded a config for ignoring metadata of FileStreamSink when reading the output.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nOptimizes the retrieval of approximate quantiles for an array of percentiles.\r\n* Adds an overload for QuantileSummaries.query that accepts an array of percentiles and optimizes the computation to do a single pass over the sketch and avoid redundant computation.\r\n* Modifies the ApproximatePercentiles operator to call into the new method.\r\n\r\nAll formatting changes are the result of running ./dev/scalafmt\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe existing implementation does repeated calls per input percentile resulting in redundant computation.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded unit tests for the new method.

For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIn the cases of nested subexpressions, whole-stage codegen's subexpression elimination will do redundant subexpression evaluation. We should reduce it. For example, if we have two sub-exprs:\r\n\r\n1. `simpleUDF($\"id\")`\r\n2. `functions.length(simpleUDF($\"id\"))`\r\n\r\nWe should only evaluate `simpleUDF($\"id\")` once, i.e.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nsubExpr1 = simpleUDF($\"id\");\r\nsubExpr2 = functions.length(subExpr1);\r\n```\r\n\r\nSnippets of generated codes:\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```java\r\n/* 040 */   private int project_subExpr_1(long project_expr_0_0) {                                                                                                           \r\n/* 041 */     boolean project_isNull_6 = false;

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n- Introduce BooleanExtensionOps in order to make boolean operators `and` and `or` data-type-based.\r\n- Improve error messages for operators `and` and `or`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nBoolean operators __and__, __or__, __rand__, and __ror__ should be data-type-based\r\n\r\nBooleanExtensionDtypes processes these boolean operators differently from bool, so BooleanExtensionOps is introduced.\r\n\r\nThese boolean operators themselves are also bitwise operators, which should be able to apply to other data types classes later. However, this is not the goal of this PR.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. Error messages for operators `and` and `or` are improved.\r\nBefore:\r\n```\r\n>>> psser = ps.Series([1, \"x\", \"y\"], dtype=\"category\")\r\n>>> psser | True\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n...\r\npyspark.sql.utils.AnalysisException: cannot resolve '(`0` OR true)' due to data type mismatch: differing types in '(`0` OR true)' (tinyint and boolean).;\r\n'Project [unresolvedalias(CASE WHEN (isnull(0#9) OR isnull((0#9 OR true))) THEN false ELSE (0#9 OR true) END, Some(org.apache.spark.sql.Column$$Lambda$1442/1725491640@6fb8afba))]\r\n+- Project [__index_level_0__#8L, 0#9, monotonically_increasing_id() AS __natural_order__#12L]\r\n   +- LogicalRDD [__index_level_0__#8L, 0#9], false\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n```\r\n>>> psser = ps.Series([1, \"x\", \"y\"], dtype=\"category\")\r\n>>> psser | True\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n...\r\nTypeError: Bitwise or can not be applied to categoricals.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIt will not generate `tmpOutputFile`, `tmpErrOutputFile` and `sessionDirs` since [SPARK-35286](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-35286). So we can remove `HiveClientImpl.closeState` to avoid these exceptions:\r\n```\r\njava.lang.NoSuchMethodError: org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.session.SessionState.getTmpErrOutputFile()Ljava/io/File\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n1. Avoid incompatible exceptions.\r\n2. Remove useless code.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- Pass the GitHub Action\r\n- Manual

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nChange the type of `DATASET_ID_TAG` from `Long` to `HashSet[Long]` to allow the logical plan to match multiple datasets.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nDuring the transformation from one Dataset to another Dataset, the DATASET_ID_TAG of logical plan won't change if the plan itself doesn't change:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/b5241c97b17a1139a4ff719bfce7f68aef094d95/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/Dataset.scala#L234-L237\r\n\r\nHowever, dataset id always changes even if the logical plan doesn't change:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/b5241c97b17a1139a4ff719bfce7f68aef094d95/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/Dataset.scala#L207-L208\r\n\r\nAnd this can lead to the mismatch between dataset's id and col's __dataset_id. E.g.,\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n  test(\"SPARK-28344: fail ambiguous self join - Dataset.colRegex as column ref\") {\r\n    // The test can fail if we change it to:\r\n    // val df1 = spark.range(3).toDF()\r\n    // val df2 = df1.filter($\"id\" > 0).toDF()\r\n    val df1 = spark.range(3)\r\n    val df2 = df1.filter($\"id\" > 0)\r\n\r\n    withSQLConf(\r\n      SQLConf.FAIL_AMBIGUOUS_SELF_JOIN_ENABLED.key -> \"true\",\r\n      SQLConf.CROSS_JOINS_ENABLED.key -> \"true\") {\r\n      assertAmbiguousSelfJoin(df1.join(df2, df1.colRegex(\"id\") > df2.colRegex(\"id\")))\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded unit tests.","created_at":"2021-05-28T07:28:14Z","updated_at":"2021-05-28T19:50:56Z","closed_at":"2021-05-28T13:05:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b218e5b9d71cbd671f1503e2a824c5aa0e40ba26","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32692/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32692/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/32692/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/00d411d7fc5322bd0a1af948e767e895e8ac0bda","head":{"label":"Ngone51:spark-35454-3.1","ref":"spark-35454-3.1","sha":"00d411d7fc5322bd0a1af948e767e895e8ac0bda","user":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":114185286,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTQxODUyODY=","name":"spark","full_name":"Ngone51/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to fix and reenable `test_stats_on_non_numeric_columns_should_be_discarded_if_numeric_only_is_true` that was disabled when we upgrade Python 3.9 in CI at https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/32657.\r\n\r\nSeems like this is because of the latest NumPy's behaviour change, see also `https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/16273#discussion_r641264085`.\r\n\r\npandas inherits this behaviour but it doesn't make sense when `numeric_only` is set to `True` in pandas. I will track and follow the status of the issue between pandas and NumPy.\r\n\r\nFor the time being, I propose to exclude boolean case alone in percentile/quartile test case\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo keep the test coverage.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, test-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI roughly locally tested.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdd a new method `isMaterialized` in `QueryStageExec`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently, we use `resultOption().get.isDefined` to check if a query stage has materialized. The code is not readable at a glance. It's better to use a new method like `isMaterialized` to define it.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR refactors `SubqueryExpression` class. It removes the children field from SubqueryExpression's constructor and adds `outerAttrs` and `joinCond`. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, the children field of a subquery expression is used to store both collected outer references in the subquery plan and join conditions after correlated predicates are pulled up.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n`SELECT (SELECT max(c1) FROM t1 WHERE t1.c1 = t2.c1) FROM t2`\r\n\r\nDuring the analysis phase, outer references in the subquery are stored in the children field: `scalar-subquery [t2.c1]`, but after the optimizer rule `PullupCorrelatedPredicates`, the children field will be used to store the join conditions, which contain both the inner and the outer references: `scalar-subquery [t1.c1 = t2.c1]`. This is why the references of SubqueryExpression excludes the inner plan's output:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/29ed1a2de42e7a663f764192fce157a9f23029b3/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/expressions/subquery.scala#L68-L69\r\n\r\nThis can be confusing and error-prone. The references for a subquery expression should always be defined as outer attribute references.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests.\r\n","created_at":"2021-05-27T21:58:13Z","updated_at":"2024-01-19T01:22:28Z","closed_at":"2021-05-31T04:57:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"da2b66ea37abe61b01a5ce3f58cfe8f5f4f06936","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32687/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32687/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/32687/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/eab933a1ae2907f3c75000c44079abdaa09b447f","head":{"label":"allisonwang-db:refactor-subquery-expr","ref":"refactor-subquery-expr","sha":"eab933a1ae2907f3c75000c44079abdaa09b447f","user":{"login":"allisonwang-db","id":66282705,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MjgyNzA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66282705?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db","html_url":"https://github.com/allisonwang-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":271915022,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzE5MTUwMjI=","name":"spark","full_name":"allisonwang-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"allisonwang-db","id":66282705,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MjgyNzA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66282705?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db","html_url":"https://github.com/allisonwang-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/allisonwang-db/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSpark conv function is from MySQL and it's better to follow the MySQL behavior. MySQL returns the max unsigned long if the input string is too big, and Spark should follow it.\r\n\r\nHowever, seems Spark has different behavior in two cases:\r\n\r\nMySQL allows leading spaces but Spark does not.\r\nIf the input string is way too long, Spark fails with ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException\r\n\r\nThis patch now help conv follow behavior in those two cases\r\nconv allows leading spaces\r\nconv will return the max unsigned long when the input string is way too long \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nfixing it to match the behavior of conv function to the (almost) only

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a followup from https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/32547#discussion_r639916474, where for LEFT ANTI join, we do not need to depend on `loaded` variable, as in `codegenAnti` we only load `streamedAfter` no more than once (i.e. assign column values from streamed row which are not used in join condition).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAvoid unnecessary processing in code-gen (though it's just `boolean $loaded = false;`, and `if (!$loaded) { $loaded = true; }`).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nExisting unite tests in

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdd a new data source V2 API: `LocalScan`. It is a special Scan that will happen on Driver locally instead of Executors.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe new API improves the flexibility of the DSV2 API. It allows developers to implement connectors for data sources of small data sizes. \r\nFor example, we can build a data source for Spark History applications from Spark History Server RESTFUL API. The result set is small and fetching all the results from the Spark driver is good enough. Making it a data source allows us to operate SQL queries with filters or table joins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nUnit

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nWe are adding a check for not evicting cached blocks from memory when enough memory is not available for placing a block from a decommissioned block manager.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nBlocks are migrated from a decommissioned block manager for utilizing already done computations. If we drop a cached block from memory to cache another block, we unnecessarily perform memory operations without saving any computation.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdded

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nBefore this pr, when we execute maven test command to test `mllib` and `kafka-0-10` module independently, there are some Java UTs failed, the key error messages are as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\njava.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: scala/collection/parallel/TaskSupport\r\n```\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\njava.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: scala/collection/parallel/immutable/ParVector\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe UTs need `scala-parallel-collections_2.13`,  but it not in classpath when we run `mvn test -pl mllib -Pscala-2.13` and `mvn test -pl external/kafka-0-10 -Pscala-2.13`.\r\n\r\nSo the main change of this pr is add `scala-2.13` profile to `mllib/pom.xml` and `external/kafka-0-10/pom.xml`, the `scala-2.13` profile include dependency on `scala-parallel-collections_2.13`, then these two modules can maven test independently.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nEnsure mllib and kafka-0-10 module can be maven test independently in Scala 2.13\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- Pass the GitHub Action Scala 2.13 job\r\n- Manual test：\r\n\r\n1.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes renaming the existing \"Koalas Accessor\" to \"Pandas API on Spark Accessor\".\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nBecause we don't use name \"Koalas\" anymore, rather use \"Pandas API on Spark\".\r\n\r\nSo, the related code bases are all need to be changed.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, the usage of pandas API on Spark accessor is changed from `df.koalas.[...]`. to `df.pandas_on_spark.[...]`.\r\n\r\n**Note:** `df.koalas.[...]` is still available but with deprecated warnings.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested in local and checked one by one.","created_at":"2021-05-26T07:33:59Z","updated_at":"2021-06-01T01:33:24Z","closed_at":"2021-06-01T01:33:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"61c12151df7f77b2a1dcd3456eaefa32fbc43664","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32674/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32674/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/32674/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ecea1edec15f47189e06a4836c3c248879b433a1","head":{"label":"itholic:SPARK-35453","ref":"SPARK-35453","sha":"ecea1edec15f47189e06a4836c3c248879b433a1","user":{"login":"itholic","id":44108233,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTA4MjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44108233?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic","html_url":"https://github.com/itholic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"af1dba7ca501fd9372b158793119163e3fcd1f24","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR fixes `HiveExternalCatalogVersionsSuite`.\r\nWith this change, only <major>.<minor> version is set to `spark.sql.hive.metastore.version`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nI'm personally checking whether all the tests pass with Java 11 for the current `master` and I found `HiveExternalCatalogVersionsSuite` fails.\r\nThe reason is that Spark 3.0.2 and 3.1.1 doesn't accept `2.3.8` as a hive metastore version.\r\n\r\n`HiveExternalCatalogVersionsSuite` downloads Spark releases from https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/spark/ and run test for each release. The Spark releases are `3.0.2` and `3.1.1` for the current `master` for now.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/e47e615c0ede9692fd3aa1098155e92e4fb50b7f/sql/hive/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/hive/HiveExternalCatalogVersionsSuite.scala#L239-L259\r\n\r\nWith Java 11, the suite run with a hive metastore version which corresponds to the builtin Hive version and it's `2.3.8` for the current `master`.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/20750a3f9e13a2f02860859f87bbc38a18cba85e/sql/hive/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/hive/HiveExternalCatalogVersionsSuite.scala#L62-L66\r\n\r\nBut `branch-3.0` and `branch-3.1` doesn't accept `2.3.8`, the suite with Java 11 fails.\r\n\r\nAnother solution would be backporting SPARK-34271 (#31371) but after [a discussion](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/32668#issuecomment-848435170), we prefer to fix the test, \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nExisting tests with

these compilation warnings.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nEliminate compilation warnings in Scala 2.13 and this change should be compatible with Scala 2.12\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass the Jenkins or GitHub

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR backports SPARK-34271 (#31371).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nI'm personally checking whether all the tests pass with Java 11 for thecurrent `master` and I found `HiveExternalCatalogVersionsSuite` fails.\r\nThe reason is that Spark 3.0.2 and 3.1.1 doesn't accept `2.3.8` as a hive metastore version.\r\n\r\n`HiveExternalCatalogVersionsSuite` downloads Spark releases from https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/spark/ and run test for each release. The Spark releases are `3.0.2` and `3.1.1` for the current `master` for now.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/e47e615c0ede9692fd3aa1098155e92e4fb50b7f/sql/hive/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/hive/HiveExternalCatalogVersionsSuite.scala#L239-L259\r\n\r\nWith Java 11, the suite run with a hive metastore version which corresponds to the builtin Hive version and it's `2.3.8` for the current `master`.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/20750a3f9e13a2f02860859f87bbc38a18cba85e/sql/hive/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/hive/HiveExternalCatalogVersionsSuite.scala#L62-L66\r\n\r\nBut `branch-3.0` and `branch-3.1` doesn't accept `2.3.8`, the suite with Java 11 fails.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nExisting tests with

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes move text data source options from Python, Scala and Java into a single page.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSo far, the documentation for text data source options is separated into different pages for each language API documents. However, this makes managing many options inconvenient, so it is efficient to manage all options in a single page and provide a link to that page in the API of each language.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, the documents will be shown below after this change:\r\n\r\n- \"Text Files\" page\r\n<img width=\"823\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-05-26 at 3 20 11 PM\"

So we will be missing row count and col stats after that. Many TPCDS queries has substring in their group by expressions, like Query8, Query23a etc.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCBO cannot estimate rowcount if the groupby clause of a query involves the expression substring. For example, we can not estimate the row count of the following query, \r\n\r\n**Eg: Query**\r\nTPCDS Q8\r\n\r\n**Before:**\r\n(From TPCDS Q8 plan)\r\nNo rowcount\r\n```\r\n\r\n +- Aggregate [ca_zip#0], [ca_zip#0], **Statistics(sizeInBytes=160.2 MiB)**\r\n       +- Project [substr(ca_zip#94, 1, 5) AS ca_zip#0], Statistics(sizeInBytes=160.2 MiB, rowCount=6.00E+6)\r\n```\r\n**After:**\r\n\r\nRowcount exists\r\n\r\n```\r\n+- Aggregate [ca_zip#0], [ca_zip#0], **Statistics(sizeInBytes=241.6 KiB, rowCount=9.90E+3)**\r\n       +- Project [substr(ca_zip#94, 1, 5) AS ca_zip#0], Statistics(sizeInBytes=143.1 MiB, rowCount=6.00E+6)\r\n\r\n```\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded UTs, manual testing\r\n\r\nImapct on TPCDS Query8:\r\nSF=1000, 8 node cluster with ExecMemory 28GB, ExecCores 4, ExecInstances 15.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<meta name=\"ProgId\"

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes move CSV data source options from Python, Scala and Java into a single page.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSo far, the documentation for CSV data source options is separated into different pages for each language API documents. However, this makes managing many options inconvenient, so it is efficient to manage all options in a single page and provide a link to that page in the API of each language.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, the documents will be shown below after this change:\r\n\r\n- \"CSV Files\" page\r\n<img width=\"970\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-05-27 at 12 35 36 PM\"

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis patch introduces a new option to specify the minimum number of offsets to read per trigger i.e. minOffsetsPerTrigger and maxTriggerDelay to avoid the infinite wait for the trigger.\r\n\r\nThis new option will allow skipping trigger/batch when the number of records available in Kafka is low. This is a very useful feature in cases where we have a sudden burst of data at certain intervals in a day and data volume is low for the rest of the day. \r\n'maxTriggerDelay' option will help to avoid cases of infinite delay in scheduling trigger and the trigger will happen irrespective of records available if the maxTriggerDelay time exceeds the last trigger. It would be an optional parameter with a default value of 15 mins. This option will be only applicable if minOffsetsPerTrigger is set.\r\n\r\nminOffsetsPerTrigger option would be optional of course, but once specified it would take precedence over maxOffestsPerTrigger which will be honored only after minOffsetsPerTrigger is satisfied.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThere are many scenarios where there is a sudden burst of data at certain intervals in a day and data volume is low for the rest of the day. Tunning such jobs is difficult as decreasing trigger processing time increasing the number of batches and hence cluster resource usage and adds to small file issues. Increasing trigger processing time adds consumer lag. This patch tries to address this issue.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThis patch was tested by adding test cases as well as manually on a cluster where the job was running for a full one day with a data burst happening once a day.\r\nHere is the picture of databurst and hence consumer lag:\r\n<img width=\"1198\" alt=\"Screenshot

4.5 mins (which is the specified trigger time): \r\n<img width=\"1154\" alt=\"Burst Time\"

and running once every 9 to 13.5 mins\r\n<img width=\"1154\" alt=\"Non Burst Time\"

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR adds a feature for removing pulled container image after every docker integration test finish.\r\nThis feature is enabled by the new propoerty `spark.tes.docker.removePulledImage`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFor idempotent.\r\nI'm trying to add docker integration tests to GA in SPARK-35483 (#32631) but I noticed that `jdbc.OracleIntegrationSuite` consistently fails(https://github.com/sarutak/spark/runs/2646707235?check_suite_focus=true).\r\nI investigated the reason and I found it's short of the storage capacity of the host on GA.\r\n```\r\n ORACLE PASSWORD FOR SYS AND SYSTEM: oracle\r\nThe location '/opt/oracle' specified for database files has insufficient space.\r\nDatabase creation needs at least '4.5GB' disk space.\r\nSpecify a different database file destination that has enough space in the configuration file '/etc/sysconfig/oracle-xe-18c.conf'.\r\nmv: cannot stat '/opt/oracle/product/18c/dbhomeXE/dbs/spfileXE.ora': No such file or directory\r\nmv: cannot stat '/opt/oracle/product/18c/dbhomeXE/dbs/orapwXE': No such file or directory\r\nORACLE_HOME = [/home/oracle] ? ORACLE_BASE environment variable is not being set since this\r\ninformation is not available for the current user ID .\r\nYou can set ORACLE_BASE manually if it is required.\r\nResetting ORACLE_BASE to its previous value or ORACLE_HOME\r\nThe Oracle base remains unchanged with value /opt/oracle\r\n#####################################\r\n########### E R R O R ###############\r\nDATABASE SETUP WAS NOT SUCCESSFUL!\r\nPlease check output for further info!\r\n########### E R R O R ###############\r\n#####################################\r\nThe following output is now a tail of the alert.log:\r\ntail: cannot open '/opt/oracle/diag/rdbms/*/*/trace/alert*.log' for reading: No such file or directory\r\ntail: no files remaining\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this feature, pulled container image is removed and keep the capacity for `jdbc.OracleIntegrationSuite` in GA.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nI confirmed the following things.\r\n\r\n* A container image which is absent in the local repository is removed after test finished if `spark.test.container.removePulledImage` is `true`.\r\n* A container image which is present in the local repository is not removed after the finished even if `spark.test.container.removePulledImage` is `true`.\r\n* A container image is not removed regardless of presence of the container image in the local repository even if `spark.test.container.removePulledImage` is

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR fixes a bug with subexpression elimination for CaseWhen statements. https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/30245 added support for creating subexpressions that are present in all branches of conditional statements. However, for a statement to be in \"all branches\" of a CaseWhen statement, it must also be in the elseValue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFix a bug where a subexpression can be created and run for branches of a conditional that don't pass. This can cause issues especially with a UDF in a branch that gets executed assuming the condition is true.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, fixes a potential bug where a UDF could be eagerly executed even though it might expect to have already passed some form of validation. For example:\r\n```\r\nval col = when($\"id\" < 0, myUdf($\"id\"))\r\nspark.range(1).select(when(col > 0, col)).show()\r\n```\r\n\r\n`myUdf($\"id\")` is considered a subexpression and eagerly evaluated, because it is pulled out as a common expression from both executions of the when clause, but if `id >= 0` it should never actually be run.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nUpdated existing test with new

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to use a proper built-in exceptions instead of the plain `Exception` in Python.\r\n\r\nWhile I am here, I fixed another minor issue at `DataFrams.schema` together:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n- except AttributeError as e:\r\n-     raise Exception(\r\n-         \"Unable to parse datatype from schema. %s\" % e)            \r\n+ except Exception as e:\r\n+     raise ValueError(\r\n+         \"Unable to parse datatype from schema. %s\" % e) from e\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow it catches all exceptions during schema parsing, chains the exception with `ValueError`. Previously it only caught `AttributeError` that does not catch all cases.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFor users to expect the proper exceptions.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYeah, the exception classes became different but should be compatible because previous exception was plain `Exception` which other exceptions inherit.\r\n\r\n### How

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr aims to update from Scala 2.13.5 to Scala 2.13.7 for Apache Spark 3.3. The main change of this pr as follows:\r\n\r\n1. For fix `weaker access privileges in overriding`, remove the access modifier different from the parent class declared in `SparkContext`, `DiskBlockObjectWriter`, `EpochTracker` and `SparkSessionExtensionSuite`\r\n\r\n2. Add explicit `()` to return `Unit` type for `DateTimeFormatter.validatePatternString` and `TimestampFormatter.validatePatternString` to avoid `type mismatch`\r\n\r\n3. Add 3 new compile args to `pom.xml` and `SparkBuild.scala` to suppress some compilation warnings that are converted to compilation error\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nScala 2.13.7 is a maintenance release for 2.13 line and the release notes as follows:\r\n\r\n- [https://github.com/scala/scala/releases/tag/v2.13.6](https://github.com/scala/scala/releases/tag/v2.13.6)\r\n-

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUse `SpecificInternalRow` instead of `GenericInternalRow` to avoid boxing / unboxing cost.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nSince it doesn't know the input row schema, `GenericInternalRow` potentially need to apply boxing for input arguments. It's better to use `SpecificInternalRow` instead since we know input data types.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nExisting
