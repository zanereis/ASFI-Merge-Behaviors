(not required for trivial changes)\r\n- [x] If a ticket exists: Does your pull request title follow the pattern \"THRIFT-NNNN: describe my issue\"?\r\n- [x] Did you squash your changes to a single commit?  (not required, but preferred)\r\n- [x] Did you do your best to avoid breaking changes?

current thrift build does not work well with the clang frontend for the Visual Studio compiler (often called \"ClangCl\" or \"clang-cl\"). This is because ClangCl identifies to cmake as \"MSVC\" but also as \"clang\". ClangCl differs from \"normal\" clang in a few minor points. The most relevant is that it does not handle the setting `-Wall` too well, because in ClangCl `-Wall` includes a few very obscure warnings like \"compatibility with c++98\" (which thrift does not have). This leads to hundreds of thousands of warnings, making the build practically unusable.\r\n\r\nThe solution is quite simple: Change the order of compilers in cmake, so MSVC is detected *before* Clang.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Did you create an [Apache Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/THRIFT/issues/) ticket?  (not required for trivial changes)\r\n- [ ] If a ticket exists: Does your pull request title follow the pattern \"THRIFT-NNNN: describe my issue\"?\r\n- [x] Did you squash your changes to a single commit?  (not required, but preferred)\r\n- [x] Did you do your best to avoid breaking changes?  If one was needed, did you label the Jira ticket with \"Breaking-Change\"?\r\n- [x] If your change does not involve any code, include `[skip ci]` anywhere in the commit message to free up build resources.","created_at":"2020-11-19T10:46:04Z","updated_at":"2021-01-18T07:19:16Z","closed_at":"2021-01-18T07:19:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a8620804760026842c67fe10285516aa89f791d0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/pulls/2280/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/pulls/2280/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/2280/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/statuses/cabef9325a3b93dd5a4041df2245c504aa692e2f","head":{"label":"BioDataAnalysis:bda_fix_clangcl_build","ref":"bda_fix_clangcl_build","sha":"cabef9325a3b93dd5a4041df2245c504aa692e2f","user":{"login":"BioDataAnalysis","id":14963143,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjE0OTYzMTQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14963143?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis","html_url":"https://github.com/BioDataAnalysis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":87579154,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4NzU3OTE1NA==","name":"thrift","full_name":"BioDataAnalysis/thrift","private":false,"owner":{"login":"BioDataAnalysis","id":14963143,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjE0OTYzMTQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14963143?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis","html_url":"https://github.com/BioDataAnalysis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/BioDataAnalysis/thrift","description":"Mirror

initializing structs\r\n* Use elided lifetimes for `Formatter`\r\n* Remove `extern crate`\r\n* Update all `Cargo.toml` files (except `lib/rs`) to remove direct references to `ordered-float` crate (use Thrift redefinition)\r\n* Update all `Cargo.toml` files (except `lib/rs`) to use updated, and a consistent set of crates\r\n\r\n## Specific changes (generator)\r\n\r\n* Remove unnecessary `()` return

team has been running a fork of php thrift (super old) and we had an issue parsing never terminates when body is empty.

However, I feel that explicitly throwing an error when there is no more data available in curl transport is beneficial in the case if caller has bugs. Let me know what you folks think.

Explain the changes in the pull request below: -->\r\nUsing Xcode 12 on macOS 10.15, any implicit function declarations are now errors rather than warnings. Some of the implicit function declarations present in thrift 0.13.0 were already addressed in 0d6a2d3. This PR fixes the ones remaining:\r\n* usage of `thrift_protocol_decorator_write_message_begin()` from thrift_multiplexed_protocol.c: https://github.com/apache/thrift/blob/b1a5cd6542f4591563d39ed2021be9fc4690528f/lib/c_glib/src/thrift/c_glib/protocol/thrift_multiplexed_protocol.c#L60\r\n* usage of `thrift_ssl_socket_authorize()` before its definition in thrift_ssl_socket.c: https://github.com/apache/thrift/blob/c5b9d9e69e80f8243c34d763d7b8af1c3dacbc00/lib/c_glib/src/thrift/c_glib/transport/thrift_ssl_socket.c#L432\r\n\r\nThis PR declares each of those functions in already-included header files to avoid the implicit function declarations.\r\n\r\n<!-- We recommend you review the checklist/tips before submitting a pull request. -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] ~~Did you create an [Apache Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/THRIFT/issues/) ticket?

(not required, but preferred)\r\n- [x] Did you do your best to avoid breaking changes?  ~~If one was needed, did you label the Jira ticket with \"Breaking-Change\"?~~\r\n- [ ] ~~If your change does not involve any code, include `[skip ci]` anywhere in the commit message to free up build resources.~~\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  The Contributing Guide at:\r\n

code that sets a domain socket path in `TServerSocket.cpp` and `TSocket.cpp` is currently slightly more complex than required (at least that is my understanding). Also it seems to contain a potential out-of-bounds-access.\r\n\r\nI simplified the code in the following way:\r\n - Ensure that the `sockaddr_un struct` is fully set to zero before using it\r\n   - This removes the necessity to deal with zero-termination of the path. It also removes the need for the `len` variable\r\n - Do not use `path_.size() + 1` length when `memcpy` the path from `path_` to the `sockaddr_un struct`\r\n   - This may be an out-of-bounds-access in the current code, depending on whether `path_` actually contains an additional zero-terminating character (which is unlikely)\r\n\r\n- [ ] Did you create an [Apache Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/THRIFT/issues/) ticket?

PR adds a minor change to C++ domain sockets.

the C++ server does not ensure that `listening_` is `true` in `isOpen()`. I think this is incorrect because in multi-threaded environments, the socket may not be open or listening yet. Also, `listening_` should only be set to `true` when the socket is fully set up and listening.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a minor change: it respects `listening_` for `isOpen()`, and sets `listening_` to `true` only at the end of spcket initialization. In heavy stress tests, we found this makes the server method `isOpen()` more reliable.\r\n\r\nThanks for consideration.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Did you create an [Apache Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/THRIFT/issues/) ticket?

(not required, but preferred)\r\n- [x] Did you do your best to avoid breaking changes?  If one was needed, did you label the Jira ticket with \"Breaking-Change\"?\r\n- [ ] If your change does not involve any code, include `[skip ci]` anywhere in the commit message to free up build resources.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  The Contributing Guide at:\r\n  https://github.com/apache/thrift/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n  has more details and tips for committing

patch: https://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/1572\r\n\r\nKeep Alive connection aren't currently possible in THttpClient since flush method closes and reopens the connection every time. Adding a fix to stop closing the connection. The earlier patch failed since it doesn't clear the response which leads to  ResponseNotReady errors and invalid buffer state. As per http client lib suggestion (https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.client.html) the previous response should be read and cleared before making next call. Added a block to read and clear the response while flushing.

py\r\n\r\nThis is inspired by changes to the Go library (THRIFT-5214) and, by proxy, [this blog post][1]. The idea is that if the other end of the socket has closed their end of the connection, we can figure that out by doing a non-blocking read on our socket before we waste time serializing and sending a message just to find out the socket is closed when we try to read the response.\r\n\r\nI've done some [benchmarking](https://gist.github.com/spladug/91483032d410714e1d416467a476a1ad) on the addition and found it performs reasonably: costing about 2 microseconds per `isOpen()` call.\r\n\r\nI've tested on Python 2.7, 3.7, and 3.8 on Linux. I've tested on Python 3.8 on Windows.\r\n\r\nWe have been running this in production at reddit for several high-throughput services for several days. There was no noticeable impact on latencies but there is a very significant drop in RPC error rates.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.blog/2020-05-20-three-bugs-in-the-go-mysql-driver/\r\n\r\n<!-- Explain the changes in the pull request below: -->\r\n  \r\n\r\n<!-- We recommend you review the checklist/tips before submitting a pull request. -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Did you create an [Apache Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/THRIFT/issues/) ticket?
