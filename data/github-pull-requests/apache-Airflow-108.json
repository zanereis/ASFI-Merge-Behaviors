custom deletion for dag runs to speed up when a DagRun has a lot of related task instances\r\n\r\n**Context:**\r\nThe solution is overwriting of custom delete and delete_all methods for the DagRun model to speed up their deletion when DagRun has a lot of task instances. The default ORM cascade deletion is performing very slowly when task instances are more than 10k because ORM is fetching all task instances from DB and then deleting them one by one.\r\nThe solution can handle the deletion of DagRun with  > 100k  task instances easily.\r\n\r\nCloses:

we had a requirement to use `test_` prefix for modules for all\r\nour tests, however this means that we could have missed some of the\r\ntests from pytest collection when they were placed in a module without\r\nthe `test_` prefix. This happened already: see https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/30311 and https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/30306\r\n\r\nThe previous attempts to remove it failed, because cassandra tests\r\nseemed to be incompatible with pytest collection when we allowed all\r\nPython files, also there were a few names that caused the pytest\r\ncollection to fail with selecting all Python files for collection.\r\n\r\nThe move is accompanied by converting pytest configuration to\r\npyproject.toml.\r\n\r\nAfter long investigation, it turned out that the cause of cassandra\r\nfailures was pytest assert rewrite with collided with Cython-related\r\ntype_codes.py definition of types.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/datastax/python-driver/pull/1142 for PR\r\nthat is aimed to fix it on cassandra side, in the meantime we\r\nare manually patching the type_codes.py file from Cassandra by adding\r\nPYTEST_DONT_REWRITE to its docstring when building the CI image for\r\ntesting.\r\n\r\nAnother error was using run_module method which also suffers from\r\nassert rewriting incompatibilities but this could be fixed by using\r\nrun_path instead. https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9007\r\n\r\nYet another assert-rewrite problem was that ``test_airflow_context``\r\nalso failed with ``--assert=rewrite`` turned on when python_files\r\nwere not filtered. No solution was found on how we can disable\r\nthe rewrite (apparently it happens for yaml.py file but adding\r\nPYTEST_DONT_REWRITE to yaml.py and related files did not help,\r\nso we had to extract the test to separate test type)\r\n\r\nAlso test in docker_tests/kubernetes_tests should be run with working\r\ndirectory being in their folders in order to apply pyproject.toml from\r\ntheir directores (without specifying asyncio mode).\r\n\r\nThe following changes are applied:\r\n\r\n* conversion of pytest configuration from pytest.ini to\r\n  pyproject.toml (for main project, docker_tests and breeze)\r\n\r\n* addedd pyproject.toml to breeze, docker_tests, kubernetes_tests\r\n  to reflect they need different configuration for pytest (lack\r\n  of pytest-asyncio for example)\r\n\r\n* adding automated patching of Cassandra type_codes.py with\r\n  PYTEST_DONT_REWRITE docstring marker\r\n\r\n* add pyproject.toml to docker context in order to include it in\r\n  sources of airflow in the image\r\n\r\n* changed working directory for k8s suite of breeze commands to be\r\n  kubernetes_tests\r\n\r\n* remove pytest.ini from docker compose mounting and automated removal\r\n  in entrypoin in case old image is used\r\n\r\n* rename few breeze function to not start with \"test_\" so that they\r\n  are not collected as test methods\r\n\r\n* remove few test dags from collecton by pytest by name\r\n\r\n* replace run_module with run_path usage in EKS test and test_[www](http://www/).\r\n\r\n* CI workflow is updated to use docker_tests as working directory\r\n  for those tests\r\n\r\n* perf dags were moved out of the tests/test_utils dir to dev\r\n  directory.\r\n\r\n* PlainAsserts test type was added and the ``test_airflow_context``\r\n  test is run in this separate test type when running parallel\r\n  tests by default.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

tests on self-hosted runners run in parallel mode, but some of the tests take longer than others (Providers and WWW tests are the longest ones - they take around 6 minutes to complete each).\r\n\r\nPrioritizing those tests to be run at the begining should speed up overal test execution (from around 17 minutes to around 14 minutes) because it allows to effectively use parallelism of the self-hosted runners bette - the Provider and WWW test will not be \"dangling\" as one of the last test to execute and run using single CPU.\r\n\r\nThis PR also manages better docker-compose networks and escapes test names so that they are better presented in the output of the tests.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

a follow-up after decoupling of the job logic from the BaseJob\r\nORM object (#30255), the `run` method of BaseJob should also be\r\ndecoupled from it (allowing BaseJobPydantic to be passed) as well\r\nas split into three steps, in order to allow db-less mode.\r\n\r\nThe \"prepare\" and \"complete\" steps of the `run` method are modifying\r\nBaseJob ORM-mapped object, so they should be

The \"execute\" method however does not need the\r\ndatabase however and should be run locally.\r\n\r\nThis is not yet full AIP-44 conversion, this is a prerequisite to do\r\nso - and AIP-44 conversion will be done as a follow-up after this one.\r\n\r\nCloses: #30295\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

all tests for providers were executed as single test type, even if only subset of provider tests were executed. However when tests for all providers are executed (for example when main tests are run or when you change some important files and add new dependencies) \"Providers\" test run all the tests for all providers sequentially which makes them longest running test type by far.\r\n\r\nThis has the side effect that often for those cases Providers test type is running alone where all the other test types had already completed. This means that parallelism of the CI instances is not used to a full extent.\r\n\r\nThis change leverages the current \"parallel\" framework of breeze that runs tests and rather than running single \"Providers[...]\" test type, it breakes the Provider test type into separate test type for each provider (if all providers are tested, this means that there are 70+ provider tests/docker composes running - not all in parallel, but up to CPU number ones are run in parallel via pooling mechanism).\r\n\r\nThis required a number of small changes, that resulted not only faster runs in CI and better use of multi-CPU instances, but also it allows much easier to utilise parallelism of local machines of develiopers to run complete set of Airflow tests using as many CPUS as they have allocated to their docker engine.\r\n\r\nThe changes include:\r\n\r\n* splitting the Provider type into as many providers are being tested (\"Providers[nnn]\")\r\n* escaping test type to avoid rich treating the provider names as not-defined markup and allows to display status in coloured form\r\n* pruning of docker-compose networks before, after and during the tests in order to avoid network exhaustion - each test type has its own docker-compose created network\r\n* avoiding unnecessary environment checks before each test in case of parallel test execution (produced unnecessary output)\r\n* amazon and google providers are always put at the beginning of the list if they are in the list - they are by far the longest so by starting them early we give them a chance to not be the last running test type, using parallelism / multiple CPUS more efficiently\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/30255 introduced \"JobRunner\" concept and decoupled the job logic\r\nfrom the ORM polymorphic *Job objects. The change was implemented\r\nin the way to minimise the review effort needed, so it avoided renaming\r\nthe modules for the runners (from `_job` to `_job_runner`).\r\n\r\nAlso BaseJob lost its \"polymorphism\" properties so the package, and class name \r\ncan be renamed to simply job.\r\n\r\nThis PR completes the JobRunner concept introduction by applying the\r\nrenames.\r\n\r\nCloses: https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/30296\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

There is an alternative solution described in Redshift unload [doc](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_UNLOAD.html), which is duplicating the single quotes:\r\n> If your query contains quotation marks (for example to enclose literal values), put the literal between two sets of single quotation marks—you must also enclose the query between single quotation marks:\r\n('select * from

think the doc is misleading on this specific metric, it says this is the time it takes to parse ALL dag files, but it's not the case. There are some reasons for why a dag could be excluded from a run:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/42db6ab4327da1a4bfd215194aee37a3d36c92d3/airflow/dag_processing/manager.py#L1179-L1182\r\nand it makes this metric very disconcerting to look at in some circumstances, because the number of files varies, so the numbers may be inconsistent.\r\n\r\nThere is a metric for the number of files processed, but it is not mentioned in the doc. I think the `total_parse_time` should always be looked at in conjunction with `file_path_queue_size`.

DagProcessorJob integration implemented in #28799 was not complete. It missed a few crucial changes:\r\n\r\n* importing DagProcessorJob in airflow/models/__init__.py - not importing it there caused `airflow jobs check` to fail, when querying DagProcessorJob in the BaseJob query, because the DagProcessorJob was not registered by the time the query was run (so polimorphic ORM model retrieval was not aware of DagProcessorJob model.\r\n\r\n* airflow jobs check command did not have DagProcessorJob added as valid job type, so it was impossible to monitor for it\r\n\r\n* also the processor manager did not set heartbeats periodically, so the Job for the DagFileProcessor was considered as not alive pretty quickly even if standalone dag-processor was running.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes all three problems.\r\n\r\nFixes: #30251\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

lot of users setup `Variable.get` calls for a bunch of configuration options in their DAGs with reasonable defaults, just to be able to set them dynamically if needed.\r\nBecause those variables are not set, we have to look in the custom backend (usually an http request), the env variables (that particular step is not a pb), and the Metastore (DB call) each time.\r\nVariables are often gotten at the top of the dag files, so those calls are made for every DAG parsing pass, slowing down the whole process.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, accessing remote secret managers is rarely free, and having a call made for each variable every time a dag file is parsed can yield high (and unexpected) API charges for cloud computing users.\r\n[AWS secret manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/pricing/): $0.05 per 10,000 API calls\r\n[GCP secret manager](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager/pricing): $0.03 per 10,000 operations\r\n[Azure key vault](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/pricing/details/key-vault/): $0.03/10,000 transactions\r\n\r\nAn alternative could be to setup a cache in those specific secret backends, but then it multiplies the work required. And since the custom backend is always the first thing that's been looked at, the behavior would be the same.\r\n\r\nI'm proposing a component-level cache, disabled by default (with a default TTL of 15 minutes), which seems like a good compromise between reducing the number of calls and still keeping some reactivity to changes.\r\nIt's configured to be active only when parsing dags (i.e. in the scehduler(s) or dag processor).\r\nThis would be marked as an experimental feature, given the potential side effects that may break some setups.\r\n\r\nSince most of the Variable getting is happening in isolated processes during DAG parsing, I'm using a [Manager](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing.Manager) to have a synchronized cache, handled under the hood in its own process.\r\nI tried to keep the impact on the codebase as low as possible. It only requires an init call before the DAG parsing processes are forked, to make sure the cache has been initialized in the parent process, and will be accessible from the children via the copied memory.\r\n\r\nFor now, there is no bound to the cache size, and no cleaning. If it is estimated that this can be a problem, we can setup a cleaning step, for instance just before DAG parsing, where I inserted the init() call.","created_at":"2023-03-23T17:01:51Z","updated_at":"2023-08-10T16:00:46Z","closed_at":"2023-08-10T13:05:11Z","merged_at":"2023-08-10T13:05:11Z","merge_commit_sha":"dc8ad0caf4da663daf39305070813d0801ebc147","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"dstandish","id":15932138,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTMyMTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15932138?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish","html_url":"https://github.com/dstandish","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstandish/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"jedcunningham","id":66968678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2OTY4Njc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66968678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham","html_url":"https://github.com/jedcunningham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1536638852,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTM2NjM4ODUy","url":"https://

BaseJob ORM model was extended and Polymorphism has been used to tie different execution logic to different job types. This has proven to be difficult to handle during AIP-44 implementation (internal API) because LocalTaskJob, DagProcessorJob and TriggererJob are all going to not use the ORM BaseJob model, but they should use BaseJobPydantic instead. In order to make it possible, we introduce a new type of object BaseJobRunner and make BaseJob use the runners instead.\r\n\r\nThis way, the BaseJobRunners are used for the logic of each of the job, where single, non-polimorphic BaseJob is used to keep the records in the database - as a follow up it will allow to completely decouple the job database operations and move it to internal_api component when db-lesss mode is enabled.\r\n\r\nCloses: #30294 \r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

For example, [AzureDataFactoryRunPipelineOperator](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/providers/microsoft/azure/operators/data_factory.py#L75) uses the [deferrable](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/providers/microsoft/azure/operators/data_factory.py#L109) parameter to toggle deferred execution while we need to use another sensor for [AzureDataFactoryPipelineRunStatusSensor](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/providers/microsoft/azure/sensors/data_factory.py#L37) (i.e., [AzureDataFactoryPipelineRunStatusAsyncSensor](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/providers/microsoft/azure/sensors/data_factory.py#LL88C7-L88C51)) to achieve the same thing.\r\n\r\n### What's changed?\r\nIn this pull request, I move the deferred logic from [AzureDataFactoryPipelineRunStatusAsyncSensor](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/providers/microsoft/azure/sensors/data_factory.py#L108) to [AzureDataFactoryPipelineRunStatusSensor](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/providers/microsoft/azure/sensors/data_factory.py#L56)  so that we can keep the consistency and reduce maintenance effort. Instead of removing [AzureDataFactoryPipelineRunStatusAsyncSensor](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/providers/microsoft/azure/sensors/data_factory.py#LL88C7-L88C51), I add a deprecation warning in case there're users using it.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

According to the documentation:\r\n\r\n> If optional argument tz is None or not specified, the timestamp is converted to the platform’s local date and time, and the returned [datetime](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime) object is naive.\r\n\r\nThe resulting datetime is then made aware using `timezone.make_aware` using the user configured timezone, which is not guarantee to be the same as the platform's timezone. If that's not the case, we can end up with modified time in the future and trigger an infinite parsing loop.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to use `datetime.utcfromtimestamp` to convert the timestamp, to force the resulting datetime in UTC, and explicitly specify the UTC timezone to `make_aware`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

#30094 introduced info log on how long serialization takes, and coupled with the fact that serialization register() function is called by just importing the serde module it caused a potential of breaking airflow CLI method that produce formatted output (with `--output` flag with json format).\r\n\r\nThose methods block warnings and logs, but only after initial CLI parsing is complete and the right CLI method is selected (with @suppress_logs_and_warnings). However in case serde module is imported before, default \"info\" log level might cause the log to be printed before it has been blocked.\r\n\r\nThe log level seemed to be left here by mistake (it's not a good practice to log anything at import time), so changing it to debug seems appropriate.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

For example, [BigQueryCheckOperator](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/providers/google/cloud/operators/bigquery.py#L200) uses the [deferrable](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/providers/google/cloud/operators/bigquery.py#L200) parameter to toggle deferred execution while we need to use another sensor for [BigQueryTableExistenceSensor](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/providers/google/cloud/sensors/bigquery.py#L37) (i.e., [BigQueryTableExistenceAsyncSensor](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/providers/google/cloud/sensors/bigquery.py#L182)) to achieve the same thing.\r\n\r\n### What's changed?\r\nIn this pull request, I move the deferred logic from [BigQueryTableExistenceAsyncSensor](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/providers/google/cloud/sensors/bigquery.py#L219) to [BigQueryTablePartitionExistenceSensor](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/providers/google/cloud/sensors/bigquery.py#L106) so that we can keep the consistency and reduce maintenance effort. Instead of removing [BigQueryTableExistenceAsyncSensor](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/providers/google/cloud/sensors/bigquery.py#L182), I add a deprecation warning in case

For example, [BigQueryCheckOperator](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/providers/google/cloud/operators/bigquery.py#L200) uses the [deferrable](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/providers/google/cloud/operators/bigquery.py#L200) parameter to toggle deferred execution while we need to use another sensor for [BigQueryTablePartitionExistenceSensor](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/providers/google/cloud/sensors/bigquery.py#L106) (i.e., [BigQueryTablePartitionExistenceAsyncSensor](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/providers/google/cloud/sensors/bigquery.py#L252)) to achieve the same thing.\r\n\r\n### What's changed?\r\nIn this pull request, I move the deferred logic from [BigQueryTablePartitionExistenceAsyncSensor](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/providers/google/cloud/sensors/bigquery.py#L281) to [BigQueryTablePartitionExistenceSensor](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/providers/google/cloud/sensors/bigquery.py#L106) so that we can keep the consistency and reduce maintenance effort. Instead of removing [BigQueryTablePartitionExistenceAsyncSensor](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/providers/google/cloud/sensors/bigquery.py#L252), I add a deprecation warning in case users're using it.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

For example, [DbtCloudRunJobOperator](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/providers/dbt/cloud/operators/dbt.py#L46) uses the [deferrable](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/providers/dbt/cloud/operators/dbt.py#L100) parameter to toggle deferred execution while we need to use another sensor for [DbtCloudJobRunSensor](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/providers/dbt/cloud/sensors/dbt.py#L31) (i.e., [DbtCloudJobRunAsyncSensor](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/providers/dbt/cloud/sensors/dbt.py#L72)) to achieve the same thing.\r\n\r\n### What's changed?\r\nIn this pull request, I move the deferred logic from [DbtCloudJobRunAsyncSensor](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/providers/dbt/cloud/sensors/dbt.py#L72) to [DbtCloudJobRunSensor](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/providers/dbt/cloud/sensors/dbt.py#L31)  so that we can keep the consistency and reduce maintenance effort. Instead of removing [DbtCloudJobRunSensor](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/providers/dbt/cloud/sensors/dbt.py#L72), I add a deprecation warning in case there're users using it.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.rst#pull-request-guidelines)** for more

reverts commit 6e2bdcfebe3e6dd43854f6e62e4e326079c6df79.\r\n\r\nThe change was done hastily when we released rc1 of 2.5.1 but it turned out to be a red-herring and something that was not really caused by Airflow's dependencies. The importlib_metadata should still be only added as dependency for Python < 3.9 as Python 3.9 does not need it. Also installing importlib_metadata manually (or by other dependencies) even in 6.1 version does not result in automated triggering of the issue - if someone happens to install importlib_metadata in Python 3.9 simply uninstalling it should solve the problem.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

`example_ec2` system test was failing because the image Id of the instance being created was not compatible with the instance type (`t2.micro`). The reason this occurred was we were not placing any conditions on the image that we selected - we just selected the most recent image. This lead to a situation where the most recent image was not compatible with the instance type. \r\n\r\nThe solution proposed in this PR is to change the instance type to T4g, which are powered by Arm-based AWS Graviton2 processors. Also, when getting the latest AMI Id, we now filter by selecting images compatible with `arm64`. This ensures that we get a compatible image every time.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

on this discussion: https://github.com/apache/airflow/discussions/30128\r\n\r\nAdds flag to immediately throw exception when the same dependencies is defined more than once in a DAG.\r\n\r\nThis is useful for catching logical errors in large DAGs e.g. where 1000s of dependencies are defined or where utility functions create tasks and dependencies.\r\n\r\nThe current warning is often not visible to a DAG author and also doesn't specify where in the DAG the warning is coming from so is hard to use as a check to ensure DAG quality. Open to reworking the approach here, it was just my first idea for this.\r\n\r\nLet me know if I missed anything, I ran pre-commit and relevant tests locally with Breeze, but I'm not sure I got all Airflow dev checks working and this would be my first PR that affects something so core to Airflow.","created_at":"2023-03-19T18:50:54Z","updated_at":"2023-03-22T00:02:16Z","closed_at":"2023-03-22T00:02:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"064b6f5bd9ccbbd653ebc15844ec2dfd24bf641b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/30189/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/30189/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/30189/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/8a87efc5dcf9edc96833e7a6031d42bcee5ba7b6","head":{"label":"notatallshaw:unique-dependencies","ref":"unique-dependencies","sha":"8a87efc5dcf9edc96833e7a6031d42bcee5ba7b6","user":{"login":"notatallshaw","id":8070352,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzAzNTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8070352?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/notatallshaw","html_url":"https://github.com/notatallshaw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notatallshaw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notatallshaw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notatallshaw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notatallshaw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notatallshaw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notatallshaw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notatallshaw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notatallshaw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notatallshaw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:main","ref":"main","sha":"732fcd789ddecd5251d391a8d9b72f130bafb046","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_

refactoring of the internal API background test, it was found that the SIGKILL termination of gunicorn in case it was not responding to SIGTERM (introduced in #11734) has never been working properly. The code assumed that gunicorn_master_process was of the subprocess.Popen type and used .poll() method to check if the process is still running and it would issue sigkill in such case.\r\n\r\nHowever the Process we have there is a psutil.Process and it has no poll() method - instead we can use is_running() method, which has the added advantage that is_running() is also checking if the pid has not been reused by another process after terminating the original gunicorn.\r\n\r\nThe result of it was this error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nAttributeError: 'Process' object has no attribute 'poll'\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

test_cli_internal_api_background test has been flakey for some time, however it's been difficult to debug and locally reproduce the problem especially on MacOS because it used pgrep newer syntax that is not supported on MacOS.\r\n\r\nThis change improves the test by using psutil instead, it also improves the diagnostics to explain more what's going on and to display more information immediately (earlier the test had separately stdout and stderr making it difficult to understand what is the sequence of events.\r\n\r\nAlso intention of the test is better explained by adding helpful messages and adding colors and rich ability to format the output and color it to make it more straightforward to diagnose the issues.\r\n\r\nThe same was applied to the original webserver background test\r\nwhich the implmentation was based on.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

is follow-up after #30127 and #30144 about handling async (deferrable) operators for amazon provider.\r\n\r\nRather than making aiobotocre directly a devel extra dependency, we create a separate \"aiobotocore\" extra that allows for greater flexibility on how we handle the aiobotocore support. It allows for two approach:\r\n\r\n1) (current) if we decide that by default we keep boto/botocore\r\n   compatible with aiobotocore in our constraints/image then\r\n   aiobotocore should be added to devel and it should be included\r\n   as preselected extra in Dockerfile. This will lead to\r\n   having aibotocore and compatible boto/botocore in both constraints\r\n   and the PROD image.\r\n\r\n2) (possible) if we decide that we prefer to keep to the latest\r\n   version of boto/botocore in constraints/image, then we could\r\n   remove aiobotocore from both constraints and PROD image. We should\r\n   also in this case swap the \"LatestBoto\" CI job introduced in\r\n   #30144 to be \"WithAiobotocore\" job - by installing aiobotocore\r\n   and downgrading boto/botocore in the job.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

the Breeze OpenTelemetry integration and adds a banner to the UI indicating it is currently experimental.\r\n\r\n(Final?) PR to add some groundwork to allow OTel support.  Follow-up to https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/29521 \r\n\r\nAfter getting a working working PoC, the Breeze integration needed a tweak to work correctly.  Changes have been tested against a working* proof-of-concept which can be found [here](https://github.com/ferruzzi/airflow/tree/ferruzzi/otel/poc) for now if anyone wants to try them out.\r\n\r\n*So far only a subset of metrics are working in that POC, but the ones that ARE working are working end to end.\r\n\r\nMajor changes:\r\n- Corrects the OpenTelemetry Collector port to 8889 instead of 8888\r\n- Adds OTel values to the Airflow Config \r\n- Adds the required new Environment Variables tot he integration's docker-compose file to set those config values \r\n- If Otel is enabled, adds a banner to the UI showing that OTel support is currently experimental \r\n- Edits to scripts/ci/docker-compose/otel-collector-config.yml to get it working as expected and trim some fat\r\n\r\nMinor Changes:\r\n- Rephrasing some docs\r\n- Cleans up some unnecessary port forwarding in the integration's docker-compose file\r\n- Cleans up some extensions in the OTel collector config file that ended up being unnecessary","created_at":"2023-03-16T23:51:25Z","updated_at":"2023-10-27T15:58:47Z","closed_at":"2023-03-17T20:43:33Z","merged_at":"2023-03-17T20:43:33Z","merge_commit_sha":"698773b6477166694263750a0d9283b49f60d9a8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ryanahamilton","id":3267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanahamilton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"bbovenzi","id":4600967,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MDA5Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4600967?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi","html_url":"https://github.com/bbovenzi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545584474,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTg0NDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:webserver","name":"area:webserver","color":"a9db3f","default":false,"description":"Webserver

PROD image cache is not as crucial as CI image cache but it can still improve time of building the image. We had a bug in our CI actions that cache pushing only worked for default Python version.\r\n\r\nThis means that most PRs were ok, but the PRs that run full set of tests run a bit slower as PROD image was building for a longer time.\r\n\r\nAdding --run-in-parallel flag should bring cache back for PROD image for all Python versions.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!
