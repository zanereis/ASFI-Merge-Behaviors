Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [x] What the pull request does\r\n   - [x] Why it does it\r\n   - [x] How it does it\r\n   - [x] Why this approach\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

- [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

HERE\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

[ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

pull request prepares the coders subpackage for Python 3 support. This pull request is the first of a series in which all subpackages will be updated using the same approach.\r\nThis approach has been documented [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xDG0MWVlDKDPu_IW9gtMvxi2S9I0GB0VDTkPhjXT0nE/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=104989467967390032603) and the WIP pull request can be found at #4990.\r\n\r\nThe used approach can be summarized as follows:\r\n\r\n- The future package provides tools to forward-port our code, while the six package focuses more on backporting. Whenever possible, we will therefore use the future package instead of the six package.\r\nThe future package provides backported Python 3 builtins, which can be used to write Python 3 style code with python 2 compatibility.\r\n\r\n- One of the biggest problems in porting python 2 code to python 3, is the changed handling of strings and bytes.\r\n\r\n  - The future package provides backported Python 3 `str` and `bytes` types. While these can be convenient to write Python 2/3 compatible code in end products, we don’t believe they are the right choice for Beam.\r\nThese backported types are new classes, subclassed from existing Python 2 builtins (e.g. `from future.builtins import int` imports the class `future.builtins.newint.newint`, which is a subclass op the Python 2 `long` type).\r\nWhile these new classes behave like the Python 3 types, they don’t give the same results when used in type checks, which are constantly used in beam (e.g. typecoders, typechecks, …)\r\n\r\n  - Instead, we propose to rewrite everything using the default `str` and `bytes` types. On Python 2, the `bytes` type is an alias for `str`. On Python 3, `str` is equivalent to Python 2 `unicode`.\r\nA consistent behaviour between Python 2/3 can be reached by using the `bytes` type whenever `str` behaviour is desired on Python 2 and `bytes` behaviour is desired on Python 3 (= bytes data).\r\nThe `unicode` type can be used whenever `unicode` behaviour is desired on Python 2 and `str` behaviour is desired on Python 3 (= text data). The `unicode` type is not available in Python 3, which can be solved by adding\r\n    ```\r\n    Try:\r\n      unicode           # pylint: disable=unicode-builtin\r\n    except NameError:\r\n      unicode = str\r\n    ```\r\n    at the top of the module.\r\n\r\n  - All string literals which represent `bytes`, should be marked as `b’’`. String literals representing `unicode` in test modules should not be marked u’’. These will automatically be interpreted as `unicode` literals in Python 3, but we still want to test for unmarked Python 2 code.\r\nDo not use the `from __future__ import unicode_literals` import since [its changes are too implicit and introduces a risk of subtle regressions on python 2](http://python-future.org/unicode_literals.html). \r\n\r\n- The used approach for the long / int types is equivalent to the `unicode` / `str` approach outlined above.\r\nThe `long` type is not available in Python 3, since `int` now has `long` behaviour. This can be solved by adding\r\n    ```\r\n    Try:\r\n      long          # pylint: disable=long-builtin\r\n    except NameError:\r\n      long = int\r\n    ```\r\n    at the top of the module.\r\n\r\n- Regression should be avoided as much as possible between the application of step 2 and step 3. This document proposes to take following measures to keep the probability of regression as low as possible:\r\n  - Add the following import to the top of every module:\r\n`from __future__ import absolute_import`\r\nWe can also add following imports to the top of every measure. This will ensures that no new code can be added using for instance the old python 2 division and adds consistency across modules. We would like to hear the community’s opinion on this.\r\n    ```\r\n    from __future__ import division\r\n    from __future__ import print_function\r\n    ```\r\n  - A new tox environment has been added which runs pylint --py3k to check for python 3 compatibility.\r\n\r\n- `range()` and `iteritems()` were not imported in from future.builtins in coder_impl.py to avoid performance regression in Cython compiled code.\r\n\r\n@aaltay @charlesccychen

sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

a basic run gradle task to Nexmark so it can be run with the DirectRunner (aka the default classpath).

Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-04-06T20:51:35Z","updated_at":"2018-04-09T16:34:45Z","closed_at":"2018-04-09T16:34:45Z","merged_at":"2018-04-09T16:34:45Z","merge_commit_sha":"cf1ff444dd5b569557f924c3af34a769095faee7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"aaltay","id":696638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NjYzOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/696638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay","html_url":"https://github.com/aaltay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/5047/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/5047/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/5047/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/5df4dc122ef80a669b4de9bf60a25645cc0b0b87","head":{"label":"lukecwik:gradle4","ref":"gradle4","sha":"5df4dc122ef80a669b4de9bf60a25645cc0b0b87","user":{"login":"lukecwik","id":10078956,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDc4OTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10078956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik","html_url":"https://github.com/lukecwik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52895685,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1Mjg5NTY4NQ==","name":"incubator-beam","full_name":"lukecwik/incubator-beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lukecwik","id":10078956,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDc4OTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10078956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik","html_url":"https://github.com/lukecwik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lukecwik/incubator-beam","description":"Mirror

can have different names depending on the runner (stage, step, user, system name...). Depending on the needs of different components (operations, logging, metrics, statesampling) these step names are passed around without a specific order.\r\n\r\nThis change starts by creating name context classes and passing them into operations.\r\n\r\nSome design decisions:\r\n- `metrics_name()` and `logging_name()` return the step names used for each of those particular functionalities. They're a bit odd to have, but they come from the fact that our name-usage is already somewhat odd. Having them allows us to remove runner-specific code in the `create_operation` functions.\r\n- I have not added `stage_name` to the name context, but it may be warranted: is stage name a concept in portable Beam? If so, I'll make sure to add `stage_name` to NameContext.\r\n\r\nNext steps are:\r\n\r\n- Migrating operations away from using their operation names, and removing them from the object definition in `operations.pxd`, and clean all the operation creating logic.\r\n- Ensuring that the `MapTask` object has a list of `NameContext`s instead of three lists with the different step names.\r\n\r\nr:

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-04-06T18:26:58Z","updated_at":"2018-04-06T19:26:22Z","closed_at":"2018-04-06T19:26:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e881500479a341f6ac797851a62de28ecdcd28fa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"aaltay","id":696638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NjYzOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/696638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay","html_url":"https://github.com/aaltay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaltay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/5042/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/5042/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/5042/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/0344bc014fd251e978bb69e5f9f4859a86eaf16c","head":{"label":"lukecwik:gradle5","ref":"gradle5","sha":"0344bc014fd251e978bb69e5f9f4859a86eaf16c","user":{"login":"lukecwik","id":10078956,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDc4OTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10078956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik","html_url":"https://github.com/lukecwik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52895685,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1Mjg5NTY4NQ==","name":"incubator-beam","full_name":"lukecwik/incubator-beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lukecwik","id":10078956,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDc4OTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10078956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik","html_url":"https://github.com/lukecwik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lukecwik/incubator-beam","description":"Mirror

issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.

issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-04-04T13:22:52Z","updated_at":"2018-04-24T08:03:46Z","closed_at":"2018-04-10T14:11:33Z","merged_at":"2018-04-10T14:11:33Z","merge_commit_sha":"506fb323dc465bcd48bff7f1ab82c9df308a243b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/5019/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/5019/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/5019/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/6df0adde868a559f947865391266f30bdaeac899","head":{"label":"aromanenko-dev:BEAM-2852-nexmark-kafka-source-sink","ref":"BEAM-2852-nexmark-kafka-source-sink","sha":"6df0adde868a559f947865391266f30bdaeac899","user":{"login":"aromanenko-dev","id":33895511,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzODk1NTEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33895511?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aromanenko-dev","html_url":"https://github.com/aromanenko-dev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aromanenko-dev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aromanenko-dev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aromanenko-dev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aromanenko-dev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aromanenko-dev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aromanenko-dev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aromanenko-dev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aromanenko-dev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aromanenko-dev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":111895688,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTE4OTU2ODg=","name":"beam","full_name":"aromanenko-dev/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"aromanenko-dev","id":33895511,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzODk1NTEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33895511?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aromanenko-dev","html_url":"https://github.com/aromanenko-dev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aromanenko-dev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aromanenko-dev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aromanenko-dev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aromanenko-dev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aromanenko-dev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aromanenko-dev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aromanenko-dev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aromanenko-dev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aromanenko-dev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/aromanenko-dev/beam","description":"Apache

issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-04-04T01:09:52Z","updated_at":"2018-04-09T22:35:50Z","closed_at":"2018-04-09T22:35:43Z","merged_at":"2018-04-09T22:35:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"7fbaebfad9f5b985a33f4c48ea2dba1dcdbdc610","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/5017/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/5017/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/5017/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/c78b15560e02e4f45af00597c1bca57960b6b843","head":{"label":"robertwb:type-inference","ref":"type-inference","sha":"c78b15560e02e4f45af00597c1bca57960b6b843","user":{"login":"robertwb","id":486017,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NjAxNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/486017?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb","html_url":"https://github.com/robertwb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":54749372,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NDc0OTM3Mg==","name":"incubator-beam","full_name":"robertwb/incubator-beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"robertwb","id":486017,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NjAxNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/486017?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb","html_url":"https://github.com/robertwb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/robertwb/incubator-beam","description":"Mirror

HERE\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-04-03T23:57:43Z","updated_at":"2018-05-18T23:06:15Z","closed_at":"2018-04-04T15:32:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"926a433fe40b42520cf52c291fe6328b789163d2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/5014/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/5014/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/5014/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/623113f6ab1ef940e5e8bd118a66dc7b081e2d80","head":{"label":"yifanzou:BEAM-3256/Add_archetype_testing/generation_to_existing_GradleBuild_PreCommit","ref":"BEAM-3256/Add_archetype_testing/generation_to_existing_GradleBuild_PreCommit","sha":"623113f6ab1ef940e5e8bd118a66dc7b081e2d80","user":{"login":"yifanzou","id":35050780,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MDUwNzgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35050780?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yifanzou","html_url":"https://github.com/yifanzou","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yifanzou/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yifanzou/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yifanzou/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yifanzou/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yifanzou/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yifanzou/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yifanzou/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yifanzou/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yifanzou/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":116185557,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTYxODU1NTc=","name":"beam","full_name":"yifanzou/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yifanzou","id":35050780,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MDUwNzgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35050780?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yifanzou","html_url":"https://github.com/yifanzou","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yifanzou/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yifanzou/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yifanzou/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yifanzou/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yifanzou/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yifanzou/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yifanzou/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yifanzou/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yifanzou/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yifanzou/beam","description":"Apache

It just executes the Gradle :runners:flink:validatesRunner task.\r\n\r\nNOTE: I still need to create a seed job and test this on Jenkins. I will post a comment confirming that this has been tested once I do so.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [x] What the pull request does\r\n   - [x] Why it does it\r\n   - [x] How it does it\r\n   - [x] Why this approach\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-04-03T23:23:34Z","updated_at":"2018-04-04T16:03:21Z","closed_at":"2018-04-04T16:03:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"581ceb376eabc1960c906dc0b33cdafbfcf78bea","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/5012/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/5012/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/5012/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/f5b3445342f75cd0074fc8230534340b9b25a246","head":{"label":"youngoli:beam3250","ref":"beam3250","sha":"f5b3445342f75cd0074fc8230534340b9b25a246","user":{"login":"youngoli","id":1740865,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDA4NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1740865?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngoli","html_url":"https://github.com/youngoli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngoli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngoli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngoli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngoli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngoli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngoli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngoli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngoli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngoli/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":103320121,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDMzMjAxMjE=","name":"beam","full_name":"youngoli/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"youngoli","id":1740865,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDA4NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1740865?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngoli","html_url":"https://github.com/youngoli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngoli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngoli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngoli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngoli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngoli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngoli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngoli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngoli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngoli/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/youngoli/beam","description":"Mirror

HERE\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-04-03T20:39:23Z","updated_at":"2018-04-03T21:25:40Z","closed_at":"2018-04-03T20:56:47Z","merged_at":"2018-04-03T20:56:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"f5fc543a211fc802135c978e4e42914c28240446","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/5009/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/5009/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/5009/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/627d0fcf9bc712341cc49e4a33376be725f6b81e","head":{"label":"bsidhom:gradle-artifacts","ref":"gradle-artifacts","sha":"627d0fcf9bc712341cc49e4a33376be725f6b81e","user":{"login":"bsidhom","id":1359900,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTk5MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1359900?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom","html_url":"https://github.com/bsidhom","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":110900797,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTA5MDA3OTc=","name":"beam","full_name":"bsidhom/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bsidhom","id":1359900,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTk5MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1359900?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom","html_url":"https://github.com/bsidhom","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsidhom/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bsidhom/beam","description":"Mirror

easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-04-03T02:47:49Z","updated_at":"2018-04-03T22:21:03Z","closed_at":"2018-04-03T22:21:03Z","merged_at":"2018-04-03T22:21:03Z","merge_commit_sha":"889520fcd0ba83f1633cd1f08e33446b65c0e874","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/5000/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/5000/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/5000/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/2fd7430d6e54f4dde866a194a7124b8098c4df20","head":{"label":"chamikaramj:revert_gcs_auth","ref":"revert_gcs_auth","sha":"2fd7430d6e54f4dde866a194a7124b8098c4df20","user":{"login":"chamikaramj","id":10819857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODE5ODU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10819857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj","html_url":"https://github.com/chamikaramj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":61584074,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MTU4NDA3NA==","name":"beam","full_name":"chamikaramj/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"chamikaramj","id":10819857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODE5ODU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10819857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj","html_url":"https://github.com/chamikaramj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/chamikaramj/beam","description":"Mirror

working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-04-03T02:06:26Z","updated_at":"2018-04-03T17:38:05Z","closed_at":"2018-04-03T17:38:05Z","merged_at":"2018-04-03T17:38:05Z","merge_commit_sha":"8797cfc55c6e7176c9c5b22c641b159772c6d8a4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4998/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4998/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4998/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/c82fc4e0bc275a422bfab6e2ca704efee9ffb8aa","head":{"label":"alanmyrvold:alan-gr-container","ref":"alan-gr-container","sha":"c82fc4e0bc275a422bfab6e2ca704efee9ffb8aa","user":{"login":"alanmyrvold","id":5553686,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NTM2ODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5553686?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alanmyrvold","html_url":"https://github.com/alanmyrvold","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alanmyrvold/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alanmyrvold/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alanmyrvold/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alanmyrvold/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alanmyrvold/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alanmyrvold/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alanmyrvold/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alanmyrvold/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alanmyrvold/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"b53aa9ca54cd2492c584ab873ab6c4c50030dd92","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":50904245,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MDkwNDI0NQ==","name":"beam","full_name":"apache/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/beam","description":"Apache
