now, if KubernetesPodOperator.reattach_on_restart is enabled, the Operator tries to find a pod regardless of its status. This might lead to an unhealthy deadlock situation if on_finish_action is set to KEEP_POD or DELETE_SUCCEEDED_POD.\r\n\r\nFor instance, if a task has on_finish_action = OnFinishAction.DELETE_SUCCEEDED_POD and it fails on the first run, any subsequent attempts of the same task will fail immediately with a Kubernetes API error, as Airflow will try to attach to a finished pod.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces changes to KPO, allowing it to reattach only to running pods.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

changes made to OracleHook class.\r\n\r\nThe replace boolean parameter claims to replace rows instead of insert, but this functionality has not been implemented and the documentation claims it works. This can be misleading to any user of this class. Furthermore, the parameter isn't even being used anywhere in this function.\r\n\r\nIn this change, I removed the unused 'replace' parameter in both the function and the docs to prevent any confusion amongst the users of this class.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/39088\r\n\r\nAs described in https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/39088#issuecomment-2093473579,\r\nwhen an OperationalError happens (in my case, it was MySQLdb.OperationalError), \r\nthe method `executor.try_adopt_task_instances(tis_to_adopt_or_reset)` is retried,\r\nand in the first attempt, all running pods have been adopted successfully, so `adopt_launched_task` will not be called even once which leads to a situation that `tis_to_flush_by_key` in the second attempt contains TIs that are already adopted.\r\nThe TIs then are flushed unnecessarily, and could be annoying as some heavy tasks get terminated and retried.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n**Please note that this PR only fixes the issue happening with kubernetes executor**. \r\n(It might happen with other executors as well but I am only using kubernetes executor at the present and not familiar with the others)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF)

pull request updates the behaviour of deferrable Databricks operators to handle manual terminations more gracefully when a Databricks operator running in deferrable mode is terminated (generally by a user manually restarting or failing a task).\r\n\r\nTo handle this scenario, we catch `asyncio.CancelledError` that's thrown, check if the job is in a non-terminal state and then proceed with cancelling it if it is. This takes a similar approach as other providers ([1], [2]) to gracefully terminate these jobs as the standard `on_kill` method on the operator doesn't work. \r\n\r\nUnlike other operators, an explicit `cancel_on_kill` input hasn't been added here, but happy to include a new parameter for the trigger based on feedback.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/36090 for the general issue around this.\r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/38912\r\n[2] https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/providers/google/cloud/triggers/dataproc.py#L125-L138\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

Users can specify a path to `jar` file which is located in GCS bucket and then the operator will download this file to the local system. In the current deferrable mode implementation operator downloads `jar` file before going to the deferrable mode. It means that on a distributed system the file is downloaded on the `worker` machine not on the `trigger` machine. And then when the operator tries to execute a Job on the `trigger` machine Airflow throws an error that the executable  `jar` file does not exist.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the

is kind of the other side of `dataset_events` implemented in #38481. The `inlet_events` context key allows the task to access past events associated with a dataset that’s defined in the task’s `inlets`, like this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@task(inlets=my_ds)\r\ndef my_task(inlet_events):\r\n    last_event_timestamp = inlet_events[my_ds][-1].timestamp\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that `inlets` is not logically related to using the dataset to schedule a DAG. An inlet dataset may or may not also be present in the DAG’s schedule. Subsequently, events accessed from `inlet_events` do not contain any logical filtering—all past events are simply returned with a list-like interface.\r\n\r\nThis PR implements the basic structure including a lazy list-like structure (that queries the database on-demand). I plan to add more changes in future PRs after this is merged (all targeting 2.10):\r\n\r\n* Rename `dataset_events` to `outlet_events` for consistency.\r\n* Allow slicing syntax e.g. `inlet_events[ds][:-3]`.\r\n* Some refactor to consolidate other list-like and lazy db access interfaces we provide elsewhere, most significantly LazyXComAccess.\r\n* Add documentation on this.","created_at":"2024-05-02T10:23:29Z","updated_at":"2024-06-03T14:10:20Z","closed_at":"2024-05-03T13:42:39Z","merged_at":"2024-05-03T13:42:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"2294001195276948900ffa712849cb9ff9d970ab","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1993586993,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTkzNTg2OTkz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/kind:documentation","name":"kind:documentation","color":"1ED98E","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2172800071,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcyODAwMDcx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:new-feature","name":"type:new-feature","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog:

#11334\r\n\r\nWe've been seeing requests for a dark mode feature in the Airflow UI for a while now. \r\n\r\nI tested it using docker-compose.yaml. \r\n\r\nAfter testing, I was able to set dark mode and light mode. \r\n\r\nThe only thing I noticed is that after switching to dark mode, the light theme is visible for a very short time when the page is updated.\r\n\r\nI think there should be a way to smooth this out in the future.\r\n\r\n## As-Is\r\n- This picture is just extract from airflow github readme. \r\n- I want to emphasize with this illustration that the dark/light mode toggle was not originally there.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/airflow/assets/40846179/b91b0c2c-3310-4767-a99e-8fac6003bb5b)\r\n\r\n\r\n## To-Be\r\n - Dark

right side of the navigation bar.\r\n#### If you changed the color of the navigation bar via a setting like AIRFLOW__WEBSERVER__NAVBAR_COLOR, the dark/light mode will be applied accordingly.\r\n\r\n---\r\n### FIX\r\n- If Dark Mode is running, a moon will appear, and if Light Mode is running, a sun will appear.","created_at":"2024-05-02T01:02:04Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T06:25:47Z","closed_at":"2024-06-26T18:45:15Z","merged_at":"2024-06-26T18:45:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"f97c2977eeaeb5a4cb1118183eec8cf87f828bc9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ryanahamilton","id":3267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanahamilton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"pierrejeambrun","id":14861206,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODYxMjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14861206?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun","html_url":"https://github.com/pierrejeambrun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"dirrao","id":39794726,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5Nzk0NzI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39794726?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dirrao","html_url":"https://github.com/dirrao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dirrao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dirrao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dirrao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dirrao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dirrao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dirrao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dirrao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dirrao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dirrao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"bbovenzi","id":4600967,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MDA5Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4600967?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi","html_url":"https://github.com/bbovenzi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labe

In Flask 2.0.x, default value of `SEND_FILE_MAX_AGE_DEFAULT` is changed from 12 hours to None on that version.\r\n`SEND_FILE_MAX_AGE_DEFAULT` affects `Expires` Field in HTTP response header.\r\nif it is None, `Expires` Field in HTTP response header is removed.\r\n\r\nthis pr add `SEND_FILE_MAX_AGE_DEFAULT` config for Flask explicitly in `/airflow/www/app.py`.\r\nIt enables static file caching in Airflow webserver.\r\n\r\nI checked Airflow configuration references and searched `SEND_FILE_MAX_AGE_DEFAULT` in Airflow codebase, but there's no way to enable static file caching for airflow webserver's Flask.\r\n\r\n## Airflow 2.9.0: As-Is\r\n<img width=\"960\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/airflow/assets/37045096/ecb58aca-93e9-483f-8e14-d0dc3ce3df6f\">\r\n\r\n## Airflow

We want to inform you about two important changes coming to support for the files.upload API.\r\n>\t\r\n> **May 8, 2024**\r\n> Newly created Slack apps will no longer be able to access the files.upload API. Existing applications will be able to continue using files.upload until support is discontinued.\r\n>\t\r\n> **March 11, 2025**\r\n> Support for the files.upload API for all apps will be discontinued.\r\n\r\nLink for more details about upcoming changes: https://api.slack.com/changelog/2024-04-a-better-way-to-upload-files-is-here-to-stay\r\n\r\nRecently we add support of `v2` method https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/36757, and also add `SlackHook.send_file_v1_to_v2` for smooth transition between `v1` and `v2` which used in operators under the hood\r\n\r\nSo I would propose to switch by default to `v2`:\r\n- Users who create Slack Apps after the **May 8, 2024** has not affected and could use Slack Operators which intends to send files into the slack\r\n- Users who use Slack Apps which created before **May 8, 2024** should grant additional scopes for the application, no mandatory changes required in existed tasks\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the

there was a lot of bad stuff happening around try_number.\r\n\r\nWe incremented it when task started running.  And because of that, we had this logic to return \"_try_number + 1\" when task *not* running.  But this gave the \"right\" try number _before_ it ran, and the wrong number _after_ it ran.  And, since it was naively incremented when task starts running -- i.e. without regard to why it is running -- we *decremented* it when deferring or exiting on a reschedule.\r\n\r\nWhat I do here is try to remove *all* of that stuff:\r\n* no more private _try_number attr\r\n* no more getter logic\r\n* no more decrementing\r\n* no more incrementing as part of task execution\r\n\r\nNow what we do is increment only when the task is set to *scheduled* and only when it's not coming out of deferral or \"up_for_reschedule\".  So the try_number will be more stable.  It will not change throughout the course of task execution.  The only time it will be incremented is when there's legitimately a new try.  \r\n\r\nOne consequence of this is that try number will no longer be incremented if you run either `airlfow tasks run` or `ti.run()` in isolation.  But because airflow assumes that all tasks runs are scheduled by the scheduler, I do not regard this to be a breaking change.\r\n\r\nIf user code or provider code has implemented hacks to get the \"right\" try_number when looking at it at the wrong time (because previously it gave the wrong answer), unfortunately that code will just have to be patched.  There are only two cases I know of in the providers codebase -- openlineage listener, and dbt openlineage.\r\n\r\nAs a courtesy for backcompat we also add property `_try_number` which is just a proxy for try_number, so you'll still be able to access this attr.  But, it will not behave the same as it did before.\r\n","created_at":"2024-04-30T21:21:39Z","updated_at":"2024-10-31T00:41:41Z","closed_at":"2024-05-09T02:56:55Z","merged_at":"2024-05-09T02:56:55Z","merge_commit_sha":"3938f71dfae21c84a3518625543a28ad02edf641","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"o-nikolas","id":65743084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NzQzMDg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65743084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas","html_url":"https://github.com/o-nikolas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ryanahamilton","id":3267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanahamilton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"bbovenzi","id":4600967,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MDA5Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4600967?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi","html_url":"https://github.com/bbovenzi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"pierrejeambrun","id":14861206,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODYxMjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14861206?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun","html_url":"https://github.com/pierrejeambrun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ephraimbuddy","id":4122866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjI4NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4122866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy","html_url":"https://github.com/ephraimbuddy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"ht

A k8s pod is created to process the task.\r\n3.  For some reason the task in the pod is killed externally and exits with some code (-9 for example).\r\n4. Since the `reattach_on_restart` parameter is set to False, the operator does not try to restart the task in the same pod for the next attempt, and tries to create a new one while the original pod still exists with the same labels.\r\n5. The new pod is created. \r\n6. Before continuing the task, `KubernetesPodOperator` tries to find the pod using the pod labels stored in the task context. \r\n7. 2 pods with such labels are found, resulting in the exception (*\"More than one pod running with labels\"*).\r\n8. The exception continues to be raised on the next tries.\r\n\r\n**Behavior after the fix**:\r\n1-6. Same behavior.\r\n7. 2 pods with such labels are found.\r\n9. If `reattach_on_restart` is False, then we loop through the pods and pick the one that was created last and assign it to be used for the next attempt.  \r\n10.  We will update the labels of the previous pod and, depending on the value of the `on_finish_action` parameter, either keep or remove it.\r\n11. The task will continue without the exception.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

complex queries (for example, queries with `ORDER BY` clauses) will be solved by running two operators sequentially: \r\n- Running the complex selection query with `BigQueryInsertJobOperator`\r\n- Running `BigQueryGetDataOperator` while providing `job_id` from the previous step (templated):\r\n   `job_id = \"{{ task_instance.xcom_pull(task_ids='insert_job_op', key='return_value')

This can for example occur when triggering PowerBI dataset refreshes.  Also added a test in TestResponseHandler and added example on how to use the operator to refresh a PowerBI dataset.  This PR also removed the response_handler param as lambda expressions can't be serialized and triggers always get serialized to the database when deferred before getting executed.  The most import change in thi PR is that the MSGraphSensor now also uses the deferable task mechanism like the MSGraphAsyncOperator, so it doesn't rely on the classic blocking poke method but defers the tasks in a 2 step.  First it will execute the call in a deferred way and check the event, if the condition is met the sensor will stop.  If not then the sensor will first defer a TimeDeltaTrigger with the specified retry_delay (default is 60 for MSGraphSensor ) and once the task completed it will redefer the poll task, that way the sensor doesn't block the workers.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

IMO for the majority of SQA 2.0 warnings there isn't something to do. That is often the case with the warnngs '_object is being merged into a Session along the backref cascade..._ ' SQA is warning the a object is pulled into the session with a backref cascade and not explicit. But often we compensate for that by adding the object a few lines later in the session which should be fine. In such cases we still get a warning but there won't be an issue later. [Here ](https://github.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/discussions/7693#discussioncomment-7290572) it is also explained.~~\r\n\r\n### Fixed reported in tests\r\n- [x]

we relied on SerializedBaseOperator.serialize_operator for serialization of all Operator objects but this is no bueno because it does not work for mapped operator.  Instead we use BaseSerialization.serialize, which calls the right method for each obj type.  To make this actually work for db isolation though, we had to do a few more things.  1. operator_class obj was not deserialized properly so fixed that. It's a weird case cus it roundtrips to a dict -- not a class.  Also expand_input did not work quite right because it roundtrips to _ExpandInputRef.  Then we had to make a small change to get_map_type_key since we might have _ExpandInputRef
