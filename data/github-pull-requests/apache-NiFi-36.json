Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-10224](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-10224) Moves Maven Checkstyle Plugin and Apache Rat Plugin execution to a separate Static Analysis job in the GitHub continuous integration workflow. This strategy avoids running static analysis in multiple build jobs and also makes it easier to distinguish between different types of workflow failures.\r\n\r\nAdditional updates include upgrading multiple GitHub Actions from Version 2 to 3 and replacing a separate Maven cache step with Maven caching integrated with the Setup Java Action. Changes also include replacing AdoptOpenJDK with Eclipse Temurin, which is the supported successor to AdoptOpenJDK.\r\n\r\nMaven configuration changes include removing an unnecessary duplication `contrib-check` profile definition in the `nifi-registry` module and changing the Maven phase from `verify` to `validate` for the Checkstyle and Rat Plugins.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-10219](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-10219) Removes the `jna-platform` dependency from `nifi-bootstrap-utils` and removes the private `OSUtils.getWindowsProcessId()` method which depends on reflection and JNA access for Java 8 on Windows.\r\n\r\nRemoving the `jna-platform` dependency removes support for retrieving spawned Process Identifiers on Windows when running on Java 8, but all references to `OSUtils.getProcessId()` treat the PID as optional. Furthermore, the bootstrap components leverage `ps` and `kill` commands that are not available on Windows, so having the PID available on Windows does not support additional operations. Java 9 and following provide a standard method for retrieving the PID.\r\n\r\nEliminating the direct dependency on `jna-platform` removes the library from `lib/bootstrap` and allows the library to be placed in `lib/properties` as a transitive dependency of `nifi-property-protection-azure`, avoiding runtime class definition issues. This also avoids the need to adjust the `nifi-assembly` configuration to remove the `jna-platform` dependency to a different location, or provide multiple copies.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-10216](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-10216) Refactors the Spring Security Configuration in `nifi-web-api` and `nifi-web-security` to remove references to the deprecated `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter` class.\r\n\r\nThe refactored implementation provides a streamlined `SecurityFilterChain` configuration in `NiFiWebApiSecurityConfiguration` and moves individual `Filter` creation to associated configuration classes.\r\n\r\nAdditional updates include setting the default Spring Security logging level to `INFO` and updating the Standard CSRF Token Repository to leverage the streamlined version of `RequestUriBuilder`, which retrieves allowed context path configuration from available initialization parameters.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-10193](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-10193)\r\n\r\nAs of now, the ExecuteStateless processor only accepts sensitive dynamic properties. Because of this, it is not possible to reference non-sensitive parameters. Thanks to [NIFI-9958](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-9958), we can now leverage the new feature allowing to define if a dynamic property is sensitive or not. This will give the users the option to reference sensitive and non sensitive parameters.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-10180](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-10180) Removes unnecessary Maven Repository definitions from the root configuration.\r\n\r\nThe Shibboleth repository is no longer necessary following the upgrade to Spring Security 5 for SAML integration. Other repository definitions unnecessarily override Maven Central and Apache Snapshots available through the parent Apache Maven configuration, and standard Maven settings. The optional MapR and Hortonworks repository profiles are also removed, as well as the Confluent repository in the Confluent Registry Service module.\r\n\r\nAdditional changes include the follow upgrades:\r\n\r\n- Upgraded Apache parent from 25 to 26\r\n- Upgraded Apache Rat Plugin from 0.13 to 0.14\r\n- Upgraded Maven Compiler Plugin from 3.9.0 to 3.10.1\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-10162](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-10162) Reorganizes `InvokeHTTP` properties with standardized naming conventions and dependent property settings.\r\n\r\nThe changes maintain compatibility with existing processor configurations, leaving property names unchanged while adjusting display names and ordering. Additional changes include correcting HTML documentation writer handling of dependent string property values.\r\n\r\nThe new `InvokeHTTP` property display names are ordered in the following general categories:\r\n\r\n1. HTTP configuration\r\n2. Socket configuration\r\n3. Proxy configuration\r\n4. Request configuration\r\n5.

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-10158](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-10158) Corrects `ListFTP` support for expression language in `Hostname` and `Port` properties.\r\n\r\nThe `ListFTP` processor declares support for expression language values derived from a variable registry, but property resolution did not perform expression evaluation in `StandardFTPClientProvider`. `ListFTP` does not have access to a FlowFile and so provides an empty Map of attributes, whereas other FTP processors provide a Map of attributes from an input FlowFile.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following

Since expression language is supported in the properties which are used in the client it is not possible to extract the creation to eg. `@OnSchedule`. Now it is not just a performance problem, but the underlying reactor-netty library logs a misleading warning on every trigger which spoils the log. Because of that we need use caching to retrieve the client.\r\n~~reactor-netty issue: https://github.com/reactor/reactor-netty/issues/2300~~\r\nazure-sdk-for-java-issue:

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-10163](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-10163) Corrects counting of bytes read and bytes written in `StandardProcessSession.exportTo(FlowFile, OutputStream)` to reflect the the number of bytes processed through the `ByteCountingInputStream`, which wraps the source content stream. This approach follows a strategy similar to the `StandardProcessSession.exportTo(FlowFile, Path)` method, which increments bytes read and bytes written based on the number of bytes copied.\r\n\r\nThis change corrects tracking of `Bytes Read` and `Bytes Transferred` in the `Status History` for Processors such as `InvokeHTTP` and `HandleHttpResponse`.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-10161](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-10161) Adds support for optional HTTP request content compression using Gzip with the standard `Content-Encoding` header described in [RFC 7231 Section 3.1.2.2](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7231#section-3.1.2.2).\r\n\r\nThe implementation adds a new property named `Content-Encoding` to `InvokeHTTP` with a default value of `DISABLED` and an optional value of `GZIP` to enable request compression.\r\n\r\nThe `ListenHTTP` Processor currently supports reading Gzip compressed requests when requests have the non-standard `flowfile-gzipped` header, and this implementation extends that behavior to check for the presence of a `Content-Encoding` header with a value of `gzip`.\r\n\r\nBoth `InvokeHTTP` and `ListenHTTP` changes include new unit tests to validate Gzip compression handling.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n###

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-9849](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-9849) Refactors SAML 2.0 authentication support using Spring Security 5 libraries.\r\n\r\nThe `spring-security-saml2-core` library reached [end of life in October 2021](https://spring.io/blog/2020/09/22/spring-security-saml-extensions-1-x-eol-on-october-6-2021). Spring Security 5 introduced direct support for SAML 2.0 integration through the `spring-security-saml2-service-provider` library.\r\n\r\nThe refactored implementation replaces custom REST resources with Spring Security Filters and related components. The new `Saml2AccessResource` class has a single method for returning a Bearer Token previously set as cookie following successful SAML 2.0 authentication. The updated approach maintains support for existing SAML resource paths, and the Administrator's Guide includes an additional section for supported resources.\r\n\r\nThe new implementation retains support for existing SAML application properties, with the exception of the following removed properties:\r\n\r\n1. `nifi.security.user.saml.message.logging.enabled`\r\n2. `nifi.security.user.saml.metadata.signing.enabled`\r\n3. `nifi.security.user.saml.signature.digest.algorithm`\r\n\r\nThe `message.logging.enabled` property is no longer applicable to the refactored implementation, and standard logger configuration applies to various Spring Security components.\r\n\r\nThe `metadata.signing.enabled` and `signature.digest.algorithm` properties applied signing SAML metadata and do not have analogous options in Spring Security 5.\r\n\r\nThe Spring Security 5 library supports both OpenSAML 3 and OpenSAML 4, however, OpenSAML 4 requires Java 11. Spring Security has marked OpenSAML 3 components as deprecated, and these implementations will need to be replaced with OpenSAML 4 components when Apache NiFi removes support for Java 8.\r\n\r\n#

Size could be decremented before the Unacknowledged Queue Size is incremented when FlowFiles are polled. This can result in the SwappablePrioriotyQueue incorrectly returning a value of true from the isEmpty() method. Additionally, updated the NiFiSystemIT so that if waiting for a particular queue size we periodically log size of all queues, which aids in debugging, and added necessary methods to FlowClient to make that happen.\r\n\r\n<!-- Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one or more -->\r\n<!-- contributor license agreements.

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-10141](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-10141) The current error logging when a field cannot be written out uses the record's (i.e the record reader's) schema, which is not an accurate depiction of why the field cannot be written. Instead the record writer's schema should be used in the logging statement to show the schema used to write the record.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-10122](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-10122) Upgrades the provided Spark Streaming dependency in `nifi-spark-receiver` to 3.3.0.

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-10114](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-10114) Removes refresh methods for a single user or group from the `ShellUserGroupProvider` in NiFi and NiFi Registry.\r\n\r\nThe single user refresh is not necessary since the information is available from the initial enumeration of known users. The single group refresh does not perform as expected because the `UserGroupProvider.getGroup()` method receives a UUID identifier specific to NiFi. The group UUID is not sufficient to perform a single group lookup using available commands. \r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-10101](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-10101) Moves the `nifi-hive-nar` out of the standard `nifi-assembly` binary build to an optional profile named `include-hive`. This approach aligns Hive 1.2 components with other Hive 1.1 and Hive 3 components which are already mapped to the optional `include-hive1_1` and `include-hive3` profiles. \r\n\r\nRemoving the inclusion of Hive 1.2 components in the default binary build reduces the standard size by 100 MB and also encourages selection of the appropriate version when downloading extension NAR files. All Hive components require the `nifi-hive-services-api-nar`, which will be included when building any of the optional profiles.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps
