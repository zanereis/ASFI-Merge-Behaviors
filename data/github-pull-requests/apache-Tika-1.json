BasicResourcePool.awaitAvailable(...)\nthat following notification/termination a resource (Connection) remains\navailable. Many thanks to C3Stones and xtb359 on github for calling\nattention to this issue.\n-- Prevent fragility under non-bootstrap / non-system CLASSLOADERs under\nJava 8, where references to java.sql.ShardingKey not available under Java 8\nprovoke NoClassDefFoundError. Bifurcate Connection proxies, generate\nversion without sharding key methods under JVMs where ShardingKey is unavailable,\nfull JDBC 4.3 Connection API proxies where ShardingKey is present.\nThanks to Force Rs on github for finding the issue and suggesting the\nsolution!\nc3p0-0.10.2\n-- Prevent freeze due to re-waiting if a non-Exception Throwable occurs\nwhile acquiring a PreparedStatement to cache. Thanks Totyo Totev!\nc3p0-0.10.1\n-- Implement more and &quot;louder&quot; (log ugly stack traces) validation of\nconfig properties.\n-- Modify former InUseLock (now InternalUseLock) and NewProxyConnection\nto use ReentrantLock rather than native monitors, to prevent pinning\nwhen clients run on loom virtual threads.\nThanks Alex Kormukhin and Jeffrey Tucker!\n-- Implement config parameter markSessionBoundaries, so that users can\ndisable JDBC 4.3 beginRequest / endRequest session boundary marking\nwhen JDBC drivers so undesirable things with those hints.\nThanks Bikas Anand!\n-- Implement more careful examination of begin/endRequest methods, to take\ninto account the case where those methods exist on the JDBC driver Connection\nimplementation, but not in the Connection interface of a pre-Java-9 JVM.\nWe still support begin/endRequest in this case, but reflectively.\nThanks Vlad Skarzhevskyy, khushboo11-dotcom!\nc3p0-0.10.0\n-- A bit more testing\nc3p0-0.10.0-pre7\n-- Improve performance of begin/endRequest support\n-- Implement c3p0-loom UninstrumentedVirtualThreadPerTaskTaskRunnerFactory\n-- Change mind. Eliminate naggingly prescriptive equals/hashCode pseudorequirements\nfrom plugin interfaces, because our canonicalization strategy is by key, doesn' actually\nrely upon those implementations.\n-- Guard collection of MBeanAttributeInfo against items that would have no getter\nor setter to prevent ugly IntrospectionExceptions.\nSee <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/swaldman/c3p0/issues/128\">swaldman/c3p0#128</a>\nThanks <a href=\"https://github.com/philippscs\"><code>@​philippscs</code></a>!\n-- Let C3P0PooledConnectionPool manager test introspected authentication that appears\nperhaps incomplete, and revert to NULL_AUTH (no-arg DataSource.getConnection()) if\nthe test fails.\nSee, should address, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/swaldman/c3p0/issues/159\">swaldman/c3p0#159</a>\nThanks <a href=\"https://github.com/sbaeumlisberger\"><code>@​sbaeumlisberger</code></a>!\nc3p0-0.10.0-pre6\n-- Lots of documentation work.\n-- Implement attemptResurrectOnCheckin config parameter.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TIKA-4303\r\n\r\nThe issue of garbled text is caused by `OneNotePropertyEnum.CachedTitleString` not being correctly parsed. It should be parsed using `handleRichEditTextUnicode`.\r\n\r\nAs for why versions `2.7.0` and earlier did not encounter garbled text, I believe it was due to a previously erroneous line of code:\r\n```java\r\nif (options.getUtf16PropertiesToPrint().contains(propertyValue.propertyId))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis line caused the parsing of OneNote files to never append the parsed content of `OneNotePropertyEnum.ImageFilename, OneNotePropertyEnum.Author, and OneNotePropertyEnum.CachedTitleString` to the xhtml.\r\n\r\nHowever, when parsing `OneNotePropertyEnum.RichEditTextUnicode`, the logic for only parsing the latest version’s content was not added. As a result, the files appeared to be successfully parsed and without garbled text, but in reality, CachedTitleString was never parsed.\r\n\r\nI only fixed the bug in the issue where the title in the uploaded file was not parsed. During the testing process, I also discovered the following issues:\r\n- Non-rich text content is not checked for the latest version, so when the content is TextExtendedAscii, it is still parsed repeatedly.\r\n- Dates are not parsed.\r\n- Chinese (or other non-Ascii characters? i'm not sure) characters in the content are not parsed.\r\n\r\nI am not sure whether to create a new issue before proceeding with these fixes, so these issues have not been addressed in this

href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2235\">#2235</a> in <code>1.18.2</code>.</p>\n<p>Please see also the full release notes for <a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/releases/tag/jsoup-1.18.2\">jsoup 1.18.2</a> if you are coming from an earlier release.</p>\n<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>When serializing to XML, attribute names containing <code>-</code>, <code>.</code>, or digits were incorrectly considered invalid and removed. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2235\">#2235</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>jsoup 1.18.2</h2>\n<h3>Improvements</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Optimized the throughput and memory use throughout the input read and parse flows, with heap allocations and GC  down between -6% and -89%, and throughput improved up to +143% for small inputs. Most inputs sizes will see  throughput increases of ~ 20%. These performance improvements come through recycling the backing <code>byte[]</code> and <code>char[]</code>  arrays used to read and parse the input. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/2186\">2186</a></li>\n<li>Speed optimized <code>html()</code> and <code>Entities.escape()</code> when the input contains UTF characters in a supplementary plane, by around 49%. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/2183\">2183</a></li>\n<li>The form associated elements returned by <code>FormElement.elements()</code> now reflect changes made to the DOM, subsequently to the original parse. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2140\">2140</a></li>\n<li>In the <code>TreeBuilder</code>, the <code>onNodeInserted()</code> and <code>onNodeClosed()</code> events are now also fired for the outermost / root <code>Document</code> node. This enables source position tracking on the Document node (which was previously unset). And it also enables the node traversor to see the outer Document node. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/2182\">2182</a></li>\n<li>Selected Elements can now be position swapped inline using <code>Elements#set()</code>. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2212\">2212</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><code>Element.cssSelector()</code> would fail if the element's class contained a <code>*</code>  character. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2169\">2169</a></li>\n<li>When tracking source ranges, a text node following an invalid self-closing element may be left untracked. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2175\">2175</a></li>\n<li>When a document has no doctype, or a doctype not named <code>html</code>, it should be parsed in Quirks Mode. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2197\">2197</a></li>\n<li>With a selector like <code>div:has(span + a)</code>, the <code>has()</code> component was not working correctly, as the inner combining query caused the evaluator to match those against the outer's siblings, not  children. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2187\">2187</a></li>\n<li>A selector query that included multiple <code>:has()</code> components in a nested <code>:has()</code> might incorrectly execute. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2131\">2131</a></li>\n<li>When cookie names in a response are duplicated, the simple view of cookies available via <code>Connection.Response#cookies()</code> will provide the last one set. Generally it is better to use the <a href=\"https://jsoup.org/cookbook/web/request-session\">Jsoup.newSession</a> method to maintain a cookie jar, as that applies appropriate path selection on cookies when making requests. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1831\">1831</a></li>\n<li>When parsing named HTML entities, base entities should resolve if they are a prefix of the input token (and not in an attribute). <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2207\">2207</a></li>\n<li>Fixed incorrect tracking of source ranges for attributes merged from late-occurring elements that were implicitly created (<code>html</code> or <code>body</code>). <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2204\">2204</a></li>\n<li>Follow the current HTML specification in the tokenizer to allow <code>&lt;</code> as part of a tag name, instead of emitting it as a character node. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2230\">2230</a></li>\n<li>Similarly, allow a <code>&lt;</code> as the start of an attribute name, vs creating a new element.

exceptions raised and poor content parsing for XPS files.\r\n\r\nThese fixes in the first commit are for the exceptions:\r\n- NPE when indices attribute is not present\r\n- Parse errors when parsing indices string, we only need the advance so I've simplified this parsing to just grab that float which is in the second comma separated value\r\n\r\nIn the second commit these are improvements to text extractions:\r\n- Don't assume glyph runs appear in vertical order\r\n- Check for VisualBrush transform which moves child canvases\r\n- Use the entire canvas stack for keying the canvas map instead of just the last one\r\n- Split GlyphRuns with large gaps into two glyph runs because in some cases another glyph run will be positioned in that gap meaning the extracted text order needs to be different.\r\n- Fix text direction assumed to be RTL when not present","created_at":"2024-10-28T14:52:44Z","updated_at":"2024-11-04T09:53:16Z","closed_at":"2024-10-31T18:09:04Z","merged_at":"2024-10-31T18:09:03Z","merge_commit_sha":"ce6a3a650418c27e11e6a8df79afe3a285e71521","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/pulls/2028/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/pulls/2028/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/issues/2028/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tika/statuses/d5e12613db593978e1153c1906841f2a49005447","head":{"label":"ruwi-next:fix-xps-regressions","ref":"fix-xps-regressions","sha":"d5e12613db593978e1153c1906841f2a49005447","user":{"login":"ruwi-next","id":144923150,"node_id":"U_kgDOCKNaDg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/144923150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruwi-next","html_url":"https://github.com/ruwi-next","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruwi-next/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruwi-next/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruwi-next/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruwi-next/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruwi-next/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruwi-next/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruwi-next/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruwi-next/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruwi-next/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":862217213,"node_id":"R_kgDOM2Rj_Q","name":"tika","full_name":"ruwi-next/tika","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ruwi-next","id":144923150,"node_id":"U_kgDOCKNaDg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/144923150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruwi-next","html_url":"https://github.com/ruwi-next","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruwi-next/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruwi-next/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruwi-next/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruwi-next/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruwi-next/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruwi-next/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruwi-next/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruwi-next/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruwi-next/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ruwi-next/tika","description":"The
