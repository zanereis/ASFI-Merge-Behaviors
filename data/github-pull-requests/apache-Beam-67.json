M1 chips are now available</h2>\n<h1>Pytorch 1.13 Release Notes</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Highlights</li>\n<li>Backwards Incompatible Changes</li>\n<li>New Features</li>\n<li>Improvements</li>\n<li>Performance</li>\n<li>Documentation</li>\n<li>Developers</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Highlights</h1>\n<p>We are excited to announce the release of PyTorch 1.13! This includes stable versions of BetterTransformer. We deprecated CUDA 10.2 and 11.3 and completed migration of CUDA 11.6 and 11.7. Beta includes improved support for Apple M1 chips and functorch, a library that offers composable vmap (vectorization) and autodiff transforms, being included in-tree with the PyTorch release. This release is composed of over 3,749 commits and 467 contributors since 1.12.1. We want to sincerely thank our dedicated community for your contributions.</p>\n<p>Summary:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The BetterTransformer feature set supports fastpath execution for common Transformer models during Inference out-of-the-box, without the need to modify the model.

#24931, which discovered that if there are multiple elements in the data buffer, then only the checkpoint for the last one can be used, previous ones are being overwritten.\r\n\r\nThe solution is to build up a list of checkpointed elements in processing, and return them.\r\n\r\nTypically streaming execution has only one element anyway, which hides the error, but this is only at the runner's discretion. If the runner batches elements, then delayed elements will no longer process.\r\n\r\nDiscovered in working on #24789, which isn't yet a clever runner at all.\r\n\r\nThis change is smaller than it looks due to complexities in testing the execution harness, which requires ample set up. However, this change covers the core DataSource side changes.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

add a meaningful description for your change here\r\nAddresses #22972 \r\n\r\nAdding onnx support to beam. ONNX Runtime is a popular framework to accelerate ML inference:\r\nhttps://onnxruntime.ai/. It supports a broad range of model frameworks including PyTorch, Tensorflow/Keras, TFLite, scikit-learn, etc.. This PR lets you call an onnx model from beam by passing in model path.\r\n\r\nSpecifically:\r\n- Added onnx_inference.py which is the onnx API.\r\n- Added onnx_inference_test.py which contains unit tests for onnx models based on PyTorch, tensor flow, and sklearn.\r\n- Added onnx_inference_it_test.py which contains integration test for sentiment classification with onnx version of RoBERTa.\r\n- Added examples/onnx_sentiment_classification.py which is an example of using an onnx version of RoBERTa for sentiment classification, also used in the integration test.\r\n- Configured test with python 3.8 in tox and gradle.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

#24870\r\n\r\n* Fixes portable and not-yet-standard logical type get deserialized to UnknownLogicalType\r\n\r\n**Please** add a meaningful description for your change here\r\n\r\nThis was broken by #23014 in particular, prior to the change, SchemaTransform sets the identifier of all  not-yet-STANDARD logical types as \"beam:logical_type:java_sdk:v1\" when translating to proto\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/beam/blob/release-2.42.0/sdks/java/core/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/schemas/SchemaTranslation.java#L183\r\n\r\nafter the change, it keeps URNs of portable logical types (identifier is a URN starts with  \"beam:logical_type:\"). This enables translating them from another SDK.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/beam/blob/release-2.43.0/sdks/java/core/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/schemas/SchemaTranslation.java#L176\r\n\r\nBut, when translating back, the code here did not change accordingly:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/beam/blob/f9a86e5e2e3bbb345dad0953d7fe6a6b8ffe7a68/sdks/java/core/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/schemas/SchemaTranslation.java#L417\r\n\r\nCausing the deserialization not attempted and reduced to UnknownLogicalType.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately Schema containing logical type with same identifier but different class is not considered equal, and is not caught by the unit test SchemaTranslationTest.FromProtoToProtoTest <- this could be a followup fix\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR alters the default Coder for pubsub message objects from `PubsubMessageWithAttributesCoder` to `PubsubMessageWithAttributesAndMessageIdAndOrderingKeyCoder` as default coder for all `PubsubMessage.class`.  Note that there was a previous dev@ thread[1] on this subject where there was no opposition to this change.\r\n\r\nThe one important detail to call out is that pipeline authors may need to explicitly set the coder to the value which was previously the default, `PubsubMessageWithAttributesCoder`, in cases where pipeline update is required.  I do have some concern over whether that's completely sufficient/possible based on the behaviour observed in https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/21162#issuecomment-1371259467.  \r\n\r\n**I'm not sure this should be merged until further testing can be done to validate whether a running pipeline can be successfully updated.**\r\n\r\n\r\nFixes #23525 \r\n\r\n[1] https://lists.apache.org/thread/c3qk0cp3rbhk2wh8m0z8gqxqy931dbwc\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Java\r\n\r\n## Robust way to look up main method\r\nTo run a Java application we need to know name of a `.class` file with the `main()` method. This change introduces logic to reliably locate such file using `javap` tool.\r\n\r\nWe cannot rely on `IsMain` metadata argument, available for multi-file examples, as we have no way of knowing names of the generated `.class` files without parsing the source code to a significant degree, as Java compiler produces one such file for each class definition in the source `.java` file with names corresponding to the name of the class defined in the source code.\r\nWe also cannot rely on the convention that the Java source file name should be the same as the name of a public class defined in that `.java` file because [we trim all](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/0b8f0b4db7a0de4977e30bcfeb50b5c14c7c1572/playground/backend/internal/preparers/java_preparers.go#L61) `public` keywords from class definitions.\r\n\r\nresolves #24860\r\n\r\n## Compilation issues\r\n\r\nImplemented compilation of multifile Java examples\r\n\r\n# Go\r\n\r\n## Compilation issues\r\nImplemented compilation of multifile Go examples\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

most common way to submit jobs to a Spark cluster is to use `spark-submit`. `SparkSessionFactory` doesn't handle that well. Despite `spark.master` being set by `spark-submit`, it's overwritten by the respective `PipelineOption` which defaults to `local[*]`.\r\n\r\n- Fix factory to not overwrite `spark.master` if configured already, use the effective Spark master going forward.\r\n\r\nStaging of classpath artifacts is necessary when running on a cluster using a local driver. This is required to populate `spark.jars` as it would be done by `spark-submit` otherwise. Unfortunately this is broken as staging is done after the session was already created.\r\n\r\n- Enable `userClassPathFirst` to deal with conflicting dependency versions. For Spark & Beam that's usually the case for Jackson and Guava, but potentially also others.\r\n\r\n- Correctly stage classpath if not in local mode and if `spark.jars` is not set. Exclude Spark jars and similar that are already available on the cluster and that cause conflicts if enabling `userClassPathFirst`.\r\n\r\n(fixes #24861).\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

[github.com/tetratelabs/wazero](https://github.com/tetratelabs/wazero) from 1.0.0-pre.4 to 1.0.0-pre.7.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/releases\">github.com/tetratelabs/wazero's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>wazero v1.0.0-pre.7 fixes a compilation problem affecting those building <code>GOARCH=386</code>. Other users can skip this version.</p>\n<p>wazero v1.0.0-pre.6 improves performance, CLI and adds a writeable filesystem.</p>\n<p>Performance, reliability and usability have been recurring trends in wazero this year, and they will continue into next. We're thankful to have so many end users and enthusiasts active, and wow.. it was an active month!</p>\n<h2>Performance</h2>\n<p>This December, <a href=\"https://github.com/mathetake\"><code>@​mathetake</code></a> has been working hard on the compiler backend, while <a href=\"https://github.com/ckaznocha\"><code>@​ckaznocha</code></a> put in time to optimize various parts of module initialization. We've also put many more benchmarks in place including I/O functions like WASI. Results were dramatic.</p>\n<p>For example, our benchmark of go compiled to wasm (<code>GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm</code>) improved almost 25%, while our benchmark for WASI+TinyGo improved compilation time by almost 25% and instantiation time nearly 10%.</p>\n<p>While these improvements are great, wazero still won't beat optimizing compilers. The good news is that <a href=\"https://github.com/mathetake\"><code>@​mathetake</code></a> proved it is possible to do JIT-ish compilation and execution in pure Go. Moreover, <a href=\"https://tetrate.io/\">Tetrate</a> has hired an extremely bright engineer to start working with Takeshi on this problem next month. For those interested in how wazero works today, take a look at this year's <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcRSe4Y-1Fc\">GopherCon presentation</a>.</p>\n<h2>CLI</h2>\n<p>wazero works with diverse wasm compilers. Many re-use the same libraries to perform tasks such as I/O, like wasi-libc. However, even those who use that routinely drop down to pure wasm functions to optimize or decouple. Moreover, Go's compiler uses its own syscall ABI which is unlike WASI. In order for us to be more efficient, we've significantly enhanced our CLI.</p>\n<p>Most notably, we added <code>--hostlogging=filesystem</code> which can show you what's happening during a command.</p>\n<pre lang=\"bash\"><code>$ tinygo build -target wasi -o cat.wasm cat.go\n$ echo hello world &gt; /tmp/hello.txt\n$ wazero run -mount=/tmp:/ --hostlogging=filesystem cat.wasm /hello.txt\n==&gt; wasi_snapshot_preview1.fd_prestat_get(fd=3)\n&lt;== (prestat={pr_name_len=1},errno=ESUCCESS)\n--snip--\n</code></pre>\n<p>We also detect if you are using Go generated wasm automatically now (<code>GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm</code>). We support logging on that, even though the functions underneath act wildly differently.</p>\n<pre lang=\"bash\"><code>$ GOARCH=wasm GOOS=js go build -o cat.wasm cat.go\n$ wazero run -mount=/tmp:/ --hostlogging=filesystem cat.wasm /hello.txt\n==&gt; go.syscall/js.valueCall(fs.open(name=/hello.txt,flags=,perm=----------))\n&lt;== (err=&lt;nil&gt;,fd=4)\n--snip--\n</code></pre>\n<p>We've also added a <code>-cachedir</code> flag which allows running the same wasm faster the second time. Those building images can use the <code>compile</code> command first, as that allows you to build cache without actually executing the module.</p>\n<p>Ex. This command took almost 140ms as it implied compilation.

href=\"https://github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/releases\">github.com/tetratelabs/wazero's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>wazero v1.0.0-pre.6 improves performance, CLI and adds a writeable filesystem.</p>\n<p>Performance, reliability and usability have been recurring trends in wazero this year, and they will continue into next. We're thankful to have so many end users and enthusiasts active, and wow.. it was an active month!</p>\n<h2>Performance</h2>\n<p>This December, <a href=\"https://github.com/mathetake\"><code>@​mathetake</code></a> has been working hard on the compiler backend, while <a href=\"https://github.com/ckaznocha\"><code>@​ckaznocha</code></a> put in time to optimize various parts of module initialization. We've also put many more benchmarks in place including I/O functions like WASI. Results were dramatic.</p>\n<p>For example, our benchmark of go compiled to wasm (<code>GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm</code>) improved almost 25%, while our benchmark for WASI+TinyGo improved compilation time by almost 25% and instantiation time nearly 10%.</p>\n<p>While these improvements are great, wazero still won't beat optimizing compilers. The good news is that <a href=\"https://github.com/mathetake\"><code>@​mathetake</code></a> proved it is possible to do JIT-ish compilation and execution in pure Go. Moreover, <a href=\"https://tetrate.io/\">Tetrate</a> has hired an extremely bright engineer to start working with Takeshi on this problem next month. For those interested in how wazero works today, take a look at this year's <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcRSe4Y-1Fc\">GopherCon presentation</a>.</p>\n<h2>CLI</h2>\n<p>wazero works with diverse wasm compilers. Many re-use the same libraries to perform tasks such as I/O, like wasi-libc. However, even those who use that routinely drop down to pure wasm functions to optimize or decouple. Moreover, Go's compiler uses its own syscall ABI which is unlike WASI. In order for us to be more efficient, we've significantly enhanced our CLI.</p>\n<p>Most notably, we added <code>--hostlogging=filesystem</code> which can show you what's happening during a command.</p>\n<pre lang=\"bash\"><code>$ tinygo build -target wasi -o cat.wasm cat.go\n$ echo hello world &gt; /tmp/hello.txt\n$ wazero run -mount=/tmp:/ --hostlogging=filesystem cat.wasm /hello.txt\n==&gt; wasi_snapshot_preview1.fd_prestat_get(fd=3)\n&lt;== (prestat={pr_name_len=1},errno=ESUCCESS)\n--snip--\n</code></pre>\n<p>We also detect if you are using Go generated wasm automatically now (<code>GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm</code>). We support logging on that, even though the functions underneath act wildly differently.</p>\n<pre lang=\"bash\"><code>$ GOARCH=wasm GOOS=js go build -o cat.wasm cat.go\n$ wazero run -mount=/tmp:/ --hostlogging=filesystem cat.wasm /hello.txt\n==&gt; go.syscall/js.valueCall(fs.open(name=/hello.txt,flags=,perm=----------))\n&lt;== (err=&lt;nil&gt;,fd=4)\n--snip--\n</code></pre>\n<p>We've also added a <code>-cachedir</code> flag which allows running the same wasm faster the second time. Those building images can use the <code>compile</code> command first, as that allows you to build cache without actually executing the module.</p>\n<p>Ex. This command took almost 140ms as it implied compilation. By precompiling, it executes 100ms quicker.</p>\n<pre lang=\"bash\"><code>$ time wazero run -mount=/tmp:/ cat.wasm /hello.txt\nhello world\n<p>real\t0m0.139s\nuser\t0m0.178s\nsys\t0m0.036s</p>\n<p>$ wazero compile -cachedir=$HOME/.wazero cat.wasm\n$ time wazero run  -cachedir=$HOME/.wazero -mount=/tmp:/ cat.wasm /hello.txt\n&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n</code></pre></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

[#issue23101](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/23101)\r\nNow the error messages are like the below:\r\n\r\n> Marshal([4]string[bar]) failed: failed to encode custom coder [4]string[bar] for TypeName [4]string. Make sure the type was registered before calling beam.Init. For example: beam.RegisterType(reflect.TypeOf((*TypeName)(nil)).Elem()). Some types can't be registered, see invalid registration types as below:(Link)\r\n>         Full error:\r\n>         failed to marshal the coder [4]string[bar].\r\n>         \tcaused by:\r\n>         \tencoding custom coder [4]string[bar] for type [4]string\r\n>         unencodable type 'array', try to wrap the type as a field in a struct, see https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/23101 for details\r\n\r\nChanges are:\r\n1. The top-level error msg contains the TypeName like \"for TypeName [4]string\", users can easily call \"beam.RegisterType\" to register that.\r\n2. Give a \"Link1\"(WIP) to what registration types are invalid. \r\n3. The lowest-level error msg now uses a simple type name like \"map\" or \"array\", it could also give a \"Link2\"(WIP) for workarounds when the type is \"map\" or \"array\".\r\n@lostluck Could u please help me with these two links? I can't find that on the beam website. Or I can help with the documentation if needed.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

exception message\r\n\r\nWhen I was setting up my Java development for this project, I ran into the problem that my project always failed to compile. The error message I received was `unsupported Java version.` \r\n\r\nHere is the code: https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/889fd8bcdc991e63eb3a25857a03e6e115b5a263/buildSrc/src/main/groovy/org/apache/beam/gradle/BeamModulePlugin.groovy#L2361-L2369\r\n\r\nHowever, just such a message is not very useful because it neither shows what the supported Java version is nor which version you are using. For example, I spent almost two hours finding the supported Java version I needed to install. \r\n\r\nSo, I propose that we should have a better error message, which will let newcomers set up their development environment more easily.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

If you develop a theme or extension that uses the\n<code>jQuery</code>, <code>$</code>, or <code>$u</code> global objects, you need to update your\nJavaScript to modern standards, or use the mitigation below.</p>\n<p>The first option is to use the sphinxcontrib.jquery_ extension, which has been\ndeveloped by the Sphinx team and contributors. To use this, add\n<code>sphinxcontrib.jquery</code> to the <code>extensions</code> list in <code>conf.py</code>, or call\n<code>app.setup_extension(&quot;sphinxcontrib.jquery&quot;)</code> if you develop a Sphinx theme\nor extension.</p>\n<p>The second option is to manually ensure that the frameworks are present.\nTo re-add jQuery and underscore.js, you will need to copy <code>jquery.js</code> and\n<code>underscore.js</code> from <code>the Sphinx repository</code>_ to your <code>static</code> directory,\nand add the following to your <code>layout.html</code>:</p>\n<p>.. code-block:: html+jinja</p>\n<p>{%- block scripts %}\n<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n{{ super() }}\n{%- endblock %}</p>\n<p>.. _sphinxcontrib.jquery: <a href=\"https://github.com/sphinx-contrib/jquery/\">https://github.com/sphinx-contrib/jquery/</a></p>\n<p>Patch by Adam Turner.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/10471\">#10471</a>, <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/10565\">#10565</a>: Removed deprecated APIs scheduled for removal in Sphinx 6.0.

would be very useful to be able to pass a user-defined query to CassandraIO for purposes of column selection only.\r\n\r\nHowever, the current method for query parsing assumes such query necessarily comes with a 'where' clause, which leads to an invalid resulting statement when this is not the case.\r\n\r\nThis behavior has been reported on issue #24829.\r\n\r\nThe hereby proposed change fixes #24829 by checking if the user given query contains a where clause, appending a \"WHERE\" to it when it doesn't, instead of a \"AND\".\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your

would be very useful to be able to pass a user-defined query to CassandraIO for purposes of column selection only.\r\n\r\nHowever, the current method for query parsing assumes such query necessarily comes with a 'where' clause, leading to an invalid resulting statement when this is not true.\r\n\r\nExample of the current behavior:\r\n\r\nInput query: \"select partition_col, other_col from keyspace.table\"\r\n\r\nResulting invalid query: \"select partition_col, other_col from keyspace.table AND token(partition_col) >= ? and token(partition_col) < ?\"\r\n\r\nResulting error:\r\nSyntaxException: [...] mismatched input 'AND' expecting EOF (..., other_col from keyspace.table [AND]...)\r\n\r\nThe hereby proposed change fixes this by checking if the user given query contains a where clause, appending a \"WHERE\" to it when it doesn't, instead of a \"AND\".\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

there's an inconsistency with how FullValue wrappings occur between SDF phases and DataSource decoding.

For now, we wrap if needed, but cleaning up the inconsistency would improve SDK throughput.\r\n\r\nThis is a re-do of #24790 since that pr was targeted incorrectly.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

initialization of metrics accumulator on driver (#24809).\r\n\r\nAttempting to initialization the metrics accumulator on the executor side during evaluation will fail, of course.  The Spark context is not available, but most of all this needs to be done before starting the evaluation. \r\n\r\nThis PR fixes all related APIs to prevent similar bugs in the future.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

SDK side race conditions that lead to flaky or hung unit tests while I've been iterating on #24789 These can cause the unit test runs to hand or fail spuriously.\r\n\r\n* Logger can sometimes be set at the same time as output being called on it. Holding the logger with an atomic, and loading from it, resolves this.\r\n* In loopback mode, the worker server can get deadlocked while shutting down, with an RPC waiting on the lock, while the graceful shutdown goroutine holds the lock, waiting for all connections to terminate. Moving the grpc server shutdown out of the critical section resolves the deadlock.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
