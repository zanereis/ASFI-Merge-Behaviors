#6099 tried to undo the splitting of the ssl.principal.mapper.rules list on comma with whitespace by sophisticated rejoining of the split list using a comma as separator. However, since possibly surrounding whitespace is not reconstructed this approach fails in general. Consider the following test case:\r\n\r\n@Test\r\npublic void testCommaWithWhitespace() throws Exception {\r\n    String value = \"RULE:^CN=((\\\\\\\\, *|\\\\w)+)(,.*|$)/$1/,DEFAULT\";\r\n\r\n    @SuppressWarnings(\"unchecked\")\r\n    List<String> rules = (List<String>) ConfigDef.parseType(\"ssl.principal.mapper.rules\", value, Type.LIST);\r\n\r\n    SslPrincipalMapper mapper = SslPrincipalMapper.fromRules(rules);\r\n    assertEquals(\"Tkac\\\\, Adam\", mapper.getName(\"CN=Tkac\\\\, Adam,OU=ITZ,DC=geodis,DC=cz\"));\r\n}\r\nThe space after the escaped comma is essential. Unfortunately, it has disappeared after splitting and rejoining.\r\n\r\nMoreover, in joinSplitRules the decision to rejoin list elements is based on local information only which might not be sufficient. It works for \"RULE:^CN=([^,ADEFLTU,]+)(,.*|$)/$1/\" but fails for the equivalent regular expression \"RULE:^CN=([^,DEFAULT,]+)(,.*|$)/$1/\".\r\n\r\nThe approach of the current PR is to change the type of the ssl.principal.mapper.rules attribute from LIST to STRING and to delegate the splitting of the rules to the SslPrincipalMapper. It knows about the structure of the rules and can perform the splitting

sure that the copy of the same topic is evenly distributed across a broker's disk.\r\nWhen some partiton's replication is assigned to a broker, which disks should these copies be placed on the broker? The original strategy is to allocate according to the number of partiitons。This strategy will result in uneven disk allocation for the topic dimension.\r\nIn order to solve this problem, we propose an improved strategy: first ensure that the number of partitions of each disk in the topic dimension is even. If the number of partitions of a topic on two disks is equal, then sort according to the total number of partitions on the disk. Select a disk with the least number of partitions to store the current replication.","created_at":"2019-07-30T05:12:00Z","updated_at":"2024-12-22T03:40:16Z","closed_at":"2024-12-22T03:40:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":5604089486,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABTgeejg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":"Stale

the existing StickyAssignor logic into an AbstractStickyAssignor class, which is extended by the existing (eager) StickyAssignor and by the new CooperativeStickyAssignor which supports incremental cooperative rebalancing.\r\n\r\nThere is no actual change to the logic -- most methods from StickyAssignor were moved to AbstractStickyAssignor to be shared with CooperativeStickyAssignor, and the `abstract MemberData memberData(Subscription)` method converts the Subscription to the embedded list of owned partitions for each assignor.\r\n\r\nThe \"generation\" logic is left in, however this is always `Optional.empty()` for the CooperativeStickyAssignor as `onPartitionsLost` should always be called when a generation is

patch includes the upgrade to a new version of the metrics library used in Kafka so that we are able to add new features on its metrics.\r\n\r\nAll tests metrics-related in the project have been updated.\r\n\r\nNotice that:\r\n* ``yammer-metrics-count`` metric in ``KafkaServer`` has been renamed to ``dropwizard-metrics-count``.\r\n* All meters and timers have SECONDS as a rate-unit. Previously, all meters in Kafka had the rate unit in seconds except the meter ``*RequestHandlerAvgIdlePercent`` (in ``KafkaRequestHandlerPool``) which now is in seconds as well (before it was in nanosecs).\r\n* The property ``eventType`` in JMXReporter MBean doesn't exist anymore. So, all meters don't have this MBean property.\r\n* I've done a refactor in the metrics trying to encapsulate a little bit the metrics inside the ``kafka.metrics`` package.\r\n* Currently, the PR just has 2 types of reservoirs for the histogram metric. This might be extended to support the other reservoirs included in this metrics library version.\r\n\r\nThis PR implements KIP-510\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2019-07-26T23:53:03Z","updated_at":"2025-01-09T03:42:42Z","closed_at":"2025-01-09T03:42:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":5604089486,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABTgeejg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":"Stale

ZK version bump broke the system test.\r\n\r\nKafka Streams depends on ZK in version 0.10.0 and 0.10.1. Previously, when running the system test we got the dependency added to the class path from the broker dependencies. With the ZK version bump, incorrect dependencies were added, resulting in class loading errors.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we (1) remove core dependencies completely for the case we run an upgrade test, because Streams does not need those dependencies anyway. (2) For the case of running the upgrade test, we add the correct jars to the class path for 0.10.0 and 0.10.1 versions.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2019-07-26T02:51:41Z","updated_at":"2019-07-29T01:19:08Z","closed_at":"2019-07-29T01:18:59Z","merged_at":"2019-07-29T01:18:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"39bcc8447c906506d63b8df156cf90174bbb8b78","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":820747028,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjA3NDcwMjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/streams","name":"streams","color":"63edea","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1257747426,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjU3NzQ3NDI2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/tests","name":"tests","color":"cfff60","default":false,"description":"Test

bump epoch and continue running after errors\r\n\r\nThis patch implements the broker-side changes for KIP-360. It adds two new fields to InitProducerId, lastEpoch and producerId. Passing these values allows the TransactionCoordinator to safely bump a producer's epoch after some failures (such as UNKNOWN_PRODUCER_ID and INVALID_PRODUCER_ID_MAPPING). When a producer calls InitProducerId after a failure, the coordinator first checks the producer ID from the request to make sure no other producer has been started using the same transactional ID. If it is safe to continue, the coordinator checks the epoch from the request; if it matches the existing epoch, the epoch is bumped and the producer can safely continue. If it matches the previous epoch, the the current epoch is returned without bumping. Otherwise, the producer is fenced.\r\n\r\n*More detailed description of your change,\r\nif necessary.

value) has no timestamp as a parameter, so it causes inconsistency to identify to which window does the key belong.\r\n\r\nThe stream module of Kafka has a window state store that stores the aggregated values for a key in a given time frame. The window store is implemented as an interface, this interface has a strange method named put(key, value), this method has does not have a timestamp as a parameter which is important to determine that to which window frame does the key belongs. In this method, the current record timestamp is used for determining the window frame(as specified in the description of the method), this constraint makes WindowStore error-prone. It is also specified in the method description that method with a timestamp parameter should be used which already present in the interface which expects key, value, and start timestamp as well of the window to which the key belongs. Therefore by deprecating (and finally removing) the method put(key, value), we can prevent inconsistency.\r\n\r\n- As the method is deprecated, the test classes which used them are needed to be changed when later the method is removed.

there are **no topics** in a cluster, kafka-topics.sh --describe without a --topic option should return empty list, not throw an exception.\r\n\r\nWe pass a boolean flag to `ensureTopicExists` method indicating whether to throw an exception if there are no topics in the cluster. In case of `kafka-topics.sh --describe`, the exception **should NOT** be thrown if either of these are true -\r\n1. A `--topic` option was not passed to the CLI. In that case, the output should be empty.\r\n2. A `--if-exists` option was passed to the CLI.\r\nEarlier, the first condition was not part of the check. This bugfix adds the first condition mentioned above to the check.\r\n\r\n**NOTE**: I have added the `desiredTopicName` argument to the ensureTopicExists to check if it is defined. I could have simply passed `!desiredTopicName.isDefined || topicOptWithExists` in case of describe and it would still fix this bug. However, to fix bug KAFKA-8053, we need to improve the error message of the exception. The `desiredTopicName` will be required to build this exception message.

rationale)\r\nfor the feature or bug fix. Unit and/or integration\r\ntests are expected for any behaviour change and\r\nsystem tests should be considered for larger changes.*\r\n\r\nWe pass a boolean flag to `ensureTopicExists` method indicating whether to throw an exception if there are no topics in the cluster. In case of `kafka-topics.sh --describe`, the exception **should NOT** be thrown if either of these are true -\r\n1. A `--topic` option was not passed to the CLI. In that case, the output should be empty.\r\n2. A `--if-exists` option was passed to the CLI.\r\n\r\nEarlier, the first condition was not part of the check. This bugfix adds the first condition mentioned above to the check.\r\n\r\nI added the necessary unit test to check for this case.\r\n\r\nAlso, I created a Kafka cluster, and without creating any topics on it, ran \r\n```\r\n./kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper <zookeeper ip and port> --describe\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis did not throw any exception, like it used to earlier.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist

is the draft fix. The approach is simple:\r\n\r\n1. Add a new method, `MetadataResponse#partitionErrors`, which returns a map from topic to the set of its partition errors. (It follows how `MetadataResponse#topicMetadata` does.)\r\n2. `Call#handleResponse` in `KafkaAdminClient#describeTopics` now uses both of topic level error map and partition level error map; if there is `ListenerNotFound` error in partition level error map, it calls `KafkaFuture#completeExceptionally`.\r\n\r\nHowever, since it now throws a new Exception, it brokes following tests which are related to the leader election.\r\n\r\n- `kafka.server.DynamicBrokerReconfigurationTest.testUncleanLeaderElectionEnable`\r\n- `kafka.api.AdminClientIntegrationTest.testElectUncleanLeadersAndNoop`\r\n- `kafka.api.AdminClientIntegrationTest.testElectUncleanLeadersForManyPartitions`\r\n- `kafka.api.AdminClientIntegrationTest.testElectUncleanLeadersForAllPartitions`\r\n- `kafka.api.AdminClientIntegrationTest.testElectUncleanLeadersForOnePartition`\r\n- `kafka.api.AdminClientIntegrationTest.testElectUncleanLeadersWhenNoLiveBrokers`\r\n- `kafka.api.SaslSslAdminClientIntegrationTest.testElectUncleanLeadersAndNoop`\r\n- `kafka.api.SaslSslAdminClientIntegrationTest.testElectUncleanLeadersForManyPartitions`\r\n- `kafka.api.SaslSslAdminClientIntegrationTest.testElectUncleanLeadersForAllPartitions`\r\n- `kafka.api.SaslSslAdminClientIntegrationTest.testElectUncleanLeadersForOnePartition`\r\n- `kafka.api.SaslSslAdminClientIntegrationTest.testElectUncleanLeadersWhenNoLiveBrokers`\r\n- `kafka.admin.TopicCommandWithAdminClientTest.testDescribeUnavailablePartitions`\r\n- `kafka.admin.TopicCommandWithAdminClientTest.testDescribeUnderMinIsrPartitionsMixed`\r\n\r\nWhich approach would be appropriate to fix the problem above?

adds a topic to its Metadata instance when send is requested. If metadata request for the topic fails (e.g. due to authorization failure),  we retain the topic in Metadata and continue to attempt refresh until a hard-coded expiry time of 5 minutes. Due to changes introduced in https://github.com/apache/kafka/commit/460e46c3bb76a361d0706b263c03696005e12566, subsequent sends to any topic including valid authorized topics report authorization failures in any topic in the metadata, rather than just the topic to which send is requested. As a result, the producer remains unusable for 5 minutes if a send is requested on an unauthorized topic. This PR fails send only if metadata for the topic being sent to has an error (or there is a fatal exception like authentication failure).\r\n\r\nConsumer adds a topic to its Metadata instance on `subscribe()` or `assign()`. Even though `assign()` is not incremental and replaces existing assignment, new assignments were being added to existing topics in SubscriptionState#groupSubscriptions, which is used for fetching topic metadata. This PR does a replace for manual assignment alone.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build

is the POC diff for overall KIP-447 implementation. Domains of changes are:\r\nServer side:\r\n- Implement consumer back-off logic with pending offsets (GroupMetadataManager.scala)\r\n- Implement generation fencing for txn offset commit (GroupCoordinator.scala)\r\n\r\nClient side:\r\nInit stage:\r\n- decide the type of producer to be initialized (StreamThread.java)\r\n- Setup task producer new initTransaction(consumer) API  (KafkaProducer.java)\r\n- Initialize thread txn producer before run loop  (StreamThread.java#maybeInitializeTransactions)\r\n- Initialize transactional.id with consumer group states (KafkaProducer.java)\r\n\r\nRunning Stage:\r\n- add handle for thread producer to get necessary offsets to commit (Task.java#getPendingOffsets)\r\n- Refactored maybeCommitPerUserRequested to share the same commit template with super class (AssignedStreamTasks.java)\r\n- Augment thread commit logic to be able to aggregate offsets, batch commit txn offsets, and restart transaction session (AssignedTasks.java#commit)\r\n- Replace `eosEnabled` logic with new flag `isTaskProducer` as necessary (search isTaskProducer in codebase)\r\n\r\nExternal API:\r\n- Add exposure for Consumer group metadata (Consumer/ConsumerCoordinator/AbstractCoordinator.java)\r\n- Some automated protocol dependencies for OffsetFetch and TxnOffsetCommit\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

rebalance timeout was added to the JoinGroup protocol in version 1. Prior to 2.3, we handled version 0 JoinGroup requests by setting the rebalance timeout to be equal to the session timeout. We lost this logic when we converted the API to use the generated schema definition (#6419) which uses the default value of -1. The impact of this is that the group rebalance timeout becomes 0, so rebalances finish immediately after we enter the PrepareRebalance state and kick out all old members. This causes consumer groups to enter an endless rebalance loop. This patch restores the old behavior.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [

purpose of this patch is to restrict the paths for updating and accessing the high watermark and the last stable offset. By doing so, we can validate that these offsets always remain within the range of the log. We also ensure that we never expose `LogOffsetMetadata` unless it is fully materialized. Finally, this patch makes a few naming changes. In particular, we remove the `highWatermark_=` and `highWatermarkMetadata_=` which are both misleading and cumbersome to test.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ]
