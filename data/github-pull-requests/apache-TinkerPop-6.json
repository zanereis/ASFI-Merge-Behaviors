multiple queries in parallel could lead to authentication failures if `MaxInProcessPerConnection` is set to a value higher than `1` as the second request could then be sent to the server while the server was still waiting for the authentication challenge response from the driver for the first query.\r\n\r\nThis made it necessary to set `MaxInProcessPerConnection=1` as a workaround for such scenarios which of course means that connection pooling is less efficient.\r\n\r\nSimply sending a validation request on each connection right after establishing the connection and therefore before it can be used to submit queries from the user should fix this issue. The downside of this is of course that connection establishment takes slightly longer. I think this is an acceptable trade-off even for scenarios where authentication is not used since this also validates the connection irrespective of authentication and also because this delay only occurs once right at the start of an application.\r\n\r\nVOTE

href=\"https://github.com/google/error-prone/releases\">com.google.errorprone:error_prone_annotations's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Error Prone 2.26.1</h2>\n<p>This release contains all of the changes in <a href=\"https://github.com/google/error-prone/releases/tag/v2.26.0\">2.26.0</a>, plus a bug fix to the module name of the annotations artifact <code>com.google.errorprone.annotations</code> (<a href=\"https://github.com/google/error-prone/commit/9d99ee76f2ca8568b69150f5df7fe845c8545d16\">https://github.com/google/error-prone/commit/9d99ee76f2ca8568b69150f5df7fe845c8545d16</a>)</p>\n<p>Starting in <code>2.26.x</code>, the 'annotations' artifact now includes a <code>module-info.java</code> for Java Platform Module System support, thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/sgammon\"><code>@​sgammon</code></a> in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/error-prone/issues/4311\">#4311</a>.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Compatibility note:</strong></p>\n<p>Now that the annotations artifact explicit declares a module instead of relying on <code>Automatic-Module-Name</code>, JDK 17 and newer perform stricter module encapsulation checks. Modularized libraries depending on Error Prone annotations <code>2.26.x</code> and newer may see errors like:</p>\n<pre><code>error: package com.google.errorprone.annotations is not visible\nimport com.google.errorprone.annotations.CheckReturnValue;\n                            ^\n  (package com.google.errorprone.annotations is declared in module com.google.errorprone.annotations, but module ... does not read it)\n</code></pre>\n<p>The fix is to add <code>requires static</code> to the module declaration of modularized libraries that depend on Error Prone annotations:</p>\n<pre lang=\"diff\"><code> module your.module {\n...\n+  requires static com.google.errorprone.annotations;\n }\n</code></pre>\n<hr />\n<p>Full Changelog: <a href=\"https://github.com/google/error-prone/compare/v2.26.0...v2.26.1\">https://github.com/google/error-prone/compare/v2.26.0...v2.26.1</a></p>\n<h2>Error Prone 2.26.0</h2>\n<p><strong>Warning: This release contains a bug, please use <a href=\"https://github.com/google/error-prone/releases/tag/v2.26.1\">2.26.1</a> or newer instead.</strong></p>\n<p>Changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The 'annotations' artifact now includes a <code>module-info.java</code> for Java Platform Module System support, thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/sgammon\"><code>@​sgammon</code></a> in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/error-prone/issues/4311\">#4311</a>.</li>\n<li>Disabled checks passed to <code>-XepPatchChecks</code> are now ignored, instead of causing a crash.

raising the minimum supported JDK from JDK 11 to JDK 17 in a future release of Error Prone, see <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/error-prone/issues/3803\">#3803</a>. Note that using a newer JDK version to run javac during the build doesn't prevent building code that is deployed to earlier versions, for example it's supported to use the JDK 17 javac and pass <code>--release 11</code> to compile Java 11 code that is deployed to a JDK 11 runtime.

[codecov/codecov-action](https://github.com/codecov/codecov-action) from 3 to 4.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/codecov/codecov-action/releases\">codecov/codecov-action's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v4.0.0</h2>\n<p>v4 of the Codecov Action uses the <a href=\"https://docs.codecov.com/docs/the-codecov-cli\">CLI</a> as the underlying upload. The CLI has helped to power new features including local upload, the global upload token, and new upcoming features.</p>\n<h2>Breaking Changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The Codecov Action runs as a <code>node20</code> action due to <code>node16</code> deprecation. See <a href=\"https://github.blog/changelog/2023-09-22-github-actions-transitioning-from-node-16-to-node-20/\">this post from GitHub</a> on how to migrate.</li>\n<li>Tokenless uploading is unsupported. However, PRs made from forks to the upstream public repos will support tokenless (e.g. contributors to OS projects do not need the upstream repo's Codecov token). This <a href=\"https://docs.codecov.com/docs/adding-the-codecov-token#github-actions\">doc</a> shows instructions on how to add the Codecov token.</li>\n<li>OS platforms have been added, though some may not be automatically detected. To see a list of platforms, see our <a href=\"https://cli.codecov.io\">CLI download page</a></li>\n<li>Various arguments to the Action have been changed. Please be aware that the arguments match with the CLI's needs</li>\n</ul>\n<p><code>v3</code> versions and below will not have access to CLI features (e.g. global upload token, ATS).</p>\n<h2>What's
