What is this PR for?\r\nAs we won't support `zeppelin.interpreters` property anymore (from `0.7.0`), the related msg should be removed accordingly. So I removed it from [docs/manual/interpreterinstallation.md#install-3rd-party-interpreters](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/docs/manual/interpreterinstallation.md#install-3rd-party-interpreters) & [InstallInterpreter.java#L291](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/zeppelin-zengine/src/main/java/org/apache/zeppelin/interpreter/install/InstallInterpreter.java#L291).

After successful installation\r\n - Before \r\n```\r\nInterpreter spark installed under /Users/ahyoungryu/Dev/zeppelin-bin/zeppelin-0.7.0-bin-netinst/interpreter/spark.\r\n\r\nAdd interpreter class name to 'zeppelin.interpreters' property in your conf/zeppelin-site.xml file\r\nCreate interpreter setting in 'Interpreter' menu on GUI. And then you can bind interpreter on your notebook\r\n```\r\n\r\n - After \r\n```\r\nInterpreter spark installed under /Users/ahyoungryu/Dev/zeppelin-development/zeppelin/interpreter/spark.\r\n\r\n1. Restart Zeppelin\r\n2. Create interpreter setting in 'Interpreter' menu on Zeppelin GUI\r\n3. Then you can bind the interpreter on your note\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. If it's skipped (since the interpreter dir already existed)\r\n - Before\r\n```\r\nDirectory /Users/ahyoungryu/Dev/zeppelin-bin/zeppelin-0.7.0-bin-netinst/interpreter/flink already exists.

Apply this patch and build with \r\n```\r\n$ mvn clean package -DskipTests -pl 'zeppelin-interpreter, zeppelin-zengine, zeppelin-server'\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Remove `interpreter/spark`\r\n```\r\n$ rm -r interpreter/spark\r\n```\r\n\r\n3.

What is this PR for?\r\n\r\nSupporting helium package configurations. I attached screenshots.\r\n\r\n#### Implementation details.\r\n\r\nIn case of spell, spell developer can create config spec in their `package.json` and it will be part of `helium.json` which is consumed by Zeppelin.\r\n\r\n```\r\n  \"config\": {\r\n    \"repeat\": {\r\n      \"type\": \"number\",\r\n      \"description\": \"How many times to repeat\",\r\n      \"defaultValue\": 1\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n```\r\n\r\n1. Persists conf per `package name@package version` since each version can require different configs even if they are the same package.\r\n2. Saves key-value config only. Since config spec (e.g `type`, `desc`, `defaultValue`) can be provided. So it's not efficient save both of them. \r\n3. Extracts config related functions to `helium.service.js` since it can be used not only in `helium.controller.js` for view but also should be used in `paragraph.controller.js`, `result.controller.js` for executing spell. \r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Feature]\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [x] - create config view in `/helium`\r\n* [x] - persist config per `package@version`\r\n* [x] - pass config to spell\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n\r\n[ZEPPELIN-2069](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2069)\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n\r\n- Build with examples `mvn clean package -Phelium-dev -Pexamples -DskipTests;`\r\n- Open `/helium` page\r\n- Update the `echo-spell` config\r\n- Execute the spell like the screenshot below.

What is this PR for?\r\n There is \"[Apache Zeppelin Stories](https://medium.com/apache-zeppelin-stories)\" channel in [Medium](https://medium.com/). So I wanted to show the blog posts in this Medium channel via Zeppelin website.  To do this, I used AWS Lambda function: [fetch-zeppelin-medium-story](https://github.com/AhyoungRyu/fetch-zeppelin-medium-story) (read RSS feed -> converted it to JSON) and make it run per every 1 day. So the result file [medium.js](https://s3.amazonaws.com/apache-zeppelin/post/medium.js)(used js file format to easily load to Zeppelin website) will be refreshed everyday. Using this file I added \"APACHE ZEPPELIN STORIES\" section below the main page of Zeppelin website. \r\n\r\nThe reason I did this way to read posts' info is\r\n1. As [Medium/medium-api-docs/issues/49](https://github.com/Medium/medium-api-docs/issues/49#issuecomment-229206837) said, currently there is no API provided by Medium to get the list of blog post info in Story channel (\"Apache Zeppelin Stories\" is _**Story**_ channel). Instead Medium suggests to [use **RSS feed**](https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/214874118-RSS-Feeds-of-publications-and-profiles). \r\n\r\n2. and simple :)  \r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\ngh-pages\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n[ZEPPELIN-2061](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2061)\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\nBuild `gh-pages` branch as described in [here](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/tree/gh-pages#build-website). Or see the below gif screenshot img :) \r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n![record](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10060731/22653640/60e06a3e-eccd-11e6-8946-9614930541dc.gif)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? no\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? no\r\n* Does this needs documentation? no\r\n","created_at":"2017-02-06T16:25:22Z","updated_at":"2017-02-28T03:46:45Z","closed_at":"2017-02-28T03:46:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"43c54580a3b96c40f0a2c50d98c512203e2e1a04","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1980/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1980/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1980/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/d72efc8707788c1954b3e355fb5d495e256c5688","head":{"label":"AhyoungRyu:add/mediumBlogPostSection","ref":"add/mediumBlogPostSection","sha":"d72efc8707788c1954b3e355fb5d495e256c5688","user":{"login":"AhyoungRyu","id":10060731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYwNzMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10060731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu","html_url":"https://github.com/AhyoungRyu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44792338,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDc5MjMzOA==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"AhyoungRyu/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AhyoungRyu","id":10060731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYwNzMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10060731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu","html_url":"https://github.com/AhyoungRyu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AhyoungRyu/zeppelin","description":"Mirror

What is this PR for?\r\nHadoop Client will re-login once the ticket expired in case of RPC and so when hive.server2.transport.mode is binary, Hive Jdbc interpreter does a relogin and works fine. But when Rest API is used i.e when hive.server2.transport.mode is http, it is not doing a re-login and so fails with GSS exception.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Bug Fix]\r\n\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* [ZEPPELIN-2063](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2063)\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\nRun hive in http mode i.e. hive.server2.transport.mode is http. Run any query say `show tables` now wait for key to expire (usually its 24hrs), now try to run the same paragraph again without restarting zeppelin-server or jdbc interpreter. It should not fail with `GSSException: No valid credentials provided (Mechanism level: Failed to find any Kerberos tgt)\r\n` exception\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? N/A\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? N/A\r\n* Does this needs documentation?

The implement of ``closeAndRemoveInterpreterGroupByUser`` call ``dereference``  only once, if ``remoteInterpreterProcess.referenceCount`` number larger than ``1``, then ``Restart`` button does not work.\r\n\r\n* ``closeAndRemoveInterpreterGroupByNoteId``  cloud not get correct processKey\r\nWhen I switch interpreter mode to ``Per user & isolated``, closeAndRemoveInterpreterGroupByNoteId will be called by clicking \"Restart\" button. \r\nAnd I will get ``intpKey=$username:`` and ``processKey=:``, therefore, ``isEqualInterpreterKeyProcessKey`` be false forever.\r\n\r\nI fix this issue by simple ways, but I only test ``spark``, ``python``, ``livy`` interpreters, maybe other interpreters have the same problem.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nBug Fix\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [ ] - Add unit test\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n[ZEPPELIN-2037](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2037)\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n1.

Monitor java processes by ``jps``\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update?\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions?\r\n* Does

What is this PR for?\r\nWhen someone is browsing a notebook and they click the *gear* button of interpreter bindings, the bindings do come up, but the person might not realize since it opens on the top of the page, and they don't get any feedback that the bindings have opened. We should scroll up the page to show the bindings.

What is this PR for?\r\nThis PR addresses the incorrect semantics and confusion caused by the \"default\" text against an interpreter group on interpreters page. \r\nThe intent of of this tag seems to be informing the user which of the interpreters among a particular group will be used by default if the user doesn't specify any %<interpreter> tag. However, the \"default\" tag is always tied to the first interpreter of the first interpreter group on the page and isn't displayed for any other interpreter groups; therefore not serving any purpose. It also leads to confusion with the default interpreter bound to a notebook on bindings page.\r\n\r\nIt would be better to remove this default tag from interpreters in order to avoid the confusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nBug Fix\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1551\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\nRun Zeppelin server. Open Interpreters menu. \"default\" shouldn't be visible against any interpreter group.\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? No\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\r\n* Does this needs documentation? No\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n![zeppelin-1551](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6438072/22550188/f0efe0d4-e974-11e6-82a4-722b9662e5db.png)\r\n","created_at":"2017-02-02T12:59:04Z","updated_at":"2017-02-07T15:11:51Z","closed_at":"2017-02-07T15:11:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4c19778ac60cac0b380949ae025cbb4df5ccd524","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1968/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1968/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1968/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/f9ded1d27b314aec618158710c86b1e172206e26","head":{"label":"namanmishra91:ZEPPELIN-1551","ref":"ZEPPELIN-1551","sha":"f9ded1d27b314aec618158710c86b1e172206e26","user":{"login":"namanmishra91","id":6438072,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MzgwNzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6438072?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/namanmishra91","html_url":"https://github.com/namanmishra91","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namanmishra91/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namanmishra91/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namanmishra91/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namanmishra91/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namanmishra91/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namanmishra91/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namanmishra91/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namanmishra91/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namanmishra91/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":80710876,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MDcxMDg3Ng==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"namanmishra91/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"namanmishra91","id":6438072,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MzgwNzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6438072?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/namanmishra91","html_url":"https://github.com/namanmishra91","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namanmishra91/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namanmishra91/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namanmishra91/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namanmishra91/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namanmishra91/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namanmishra91/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namanmishra91/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namanmishra91/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/namanmishra91/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/namanmishra91/zeppelin","description":"Mirror

What is this PR for?\r\nCurrently Helium online package registry file([helium.json](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helium-package/helium.json)) contains both `SPELL` and `VISUALIZATION` pkgs' info. But Zeppelin-0.7 can't include #1940 I guess. Then Zeppelin must show only available package types (`VISUALIZATION` and `APPLICATION`) in 0.7 version. So I made this PR based on `branch-0.7`. \r\n\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nHot Fix \r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n[ZEPPELIN-2038](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2038)\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n1. Run Zeppelin web dev mode under `zeppelin-web`  and go to [http://localhost:9000/#/helium](http://localhost:9000/#/helium).\r\n```\r\n$ yarn run dev\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Check whether `SPELL` type package appears or not. Only `VISUALIZATION`(comes from Helium online registry [https://s3.amazonaws.com/helium-package/helium.json](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helium-package/helium.json)) or `APPLICATION`(if you put `zeppelin-example-clock.json` under `ZEPPELIN_HOME/helium/` dir) should show up with this patch.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n**Before**\r\n![screen shot 2017-02-01 at 5 01 06

What is this PR for?\r\n#1879 check if `$scope.editor` is null on `focusParagraph` message, and if it is, just return without handling focus/blur.\r\nInstead of doing null check in the beginning of `$scope.on(focusParagraph)`, I made null check to be scoped only to `$scope.editor`'s method invocation.\r\nFYI, when I say focus/blur, it means paragraph focus. Focused paragraph has different css style from blurred paragraph.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nBug Fix | Hot Fix\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n[ZEPPELIN-2033](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2033)\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\nGo to `Zeppelin Tutorial/Matplotlib (Python • PySpark)` notebook and see:\r\n - if first paragraph is blurred, when you click second paragraph.\r\n - if first paragraph is not run when you run second paragraph with shift + enter. In current master, first editor is not blurred even if you click second paragraph, which makes both first and second paragraph to be focused. This will make both paragraphs to be run.\r\n - if it is focused when you click third paragraph whose editor is hidden. In current master, it won't work.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? no\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? no\r\n* Does this needs documentation? no\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-31T10:36:06Z","updated_at":"2017-03-06T04:43:53Z","closed_at":"2017-02-02T01:49:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"aacf995ecc124f23086b3bdabac1b8d0e6e1a2d4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1963/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1963/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1963/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/3bf07ca5e915a6ddfa680f965e69ccac53de9a0d","head":{"label":"minahlee:ZEPPELIN-2033","ref":"ZEPPELIN-2033","sha":"3bf07ca5e915a6ddfa680f965e69ccac53de9a0d","user":{"login":"minahlee","id":8503346,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDMzNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8503346?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee","html_url":"https://github.com/minahlee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":33116265,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzExNjI2NQ==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"minahlee/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"minahlee","id":8503346,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDMzNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8503346?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee","html_url":"https://github.com/minahlee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/minahlee/zeppelin","description":"Mirror

was fall when CPU switched `RemoteScheduler` execution (which executes a job in a separate thread) back to test main thread execution after changing job status to `Status.FINISHED` but before updating running jobs list:\r\n```\r\njob.setStatus(lastStatus);\r\n\r\n// if thread execution is switched here to the main thread test will fall\r\n\r\nsynchronized (queue) {\r\n    running.remove(job);\r\n

of a job status and a scheduler running jobs list when a job is terminated.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nBug Fix\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n[ZEPPELIN-525](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-525)\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\nYou may place a `Thread.sleep(1000);` code to the `RemoteScheduler.java` class after the `job.setStatus(lastStatus);` (line number 354). This will increase probability of threads switching after this line. Test should not fail.\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? **no**\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? **no**\r\n* Does this needs documentation? **no**\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-27T12:01:50Z","updated_at":"2017-01-30T07:36:20Z","closed_at":"2017-01-30T07:36:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5514553958feb7f6bd102e3706e3d00300144ac6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1954/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1954/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1954/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/8a0f4afbdf2286748cff4cc415401670de904700","head":{"label":"AlexanderShoshin:ZEPPELIN-525","ref":"ZEPPELIN-525","sha":"8a0f4afbdf2286748cff4cc415401670de904700","user":{"login":"AlexanderShoshin","id":14204288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjA0Mjg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14204288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderShoshin","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexanderShoshin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderShoshin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderShoshin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderShoshin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderShoshin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderShoshin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderShoshin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderShoshin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderShoshin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderShoshin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":76038976,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NjAzODk3Ng==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"AlexanderShoshin/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlexanderShoshin","id":14204288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjA0Mjg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14204288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderShoshin","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexanderShoshin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderShoshin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderShoshin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderShoshin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderShoshin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderShoshin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderShoshin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderShoshin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderShoshin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexanderShoshin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlexanderShoshin/zeppelin","description":"Mirror

are skipped when executing, but if the paragraph had status `READY` that status will be stayed same and then the note won't be considered as terminated in [here](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/zeppelin-zengine/src/main/java/org/apache/zeppelin/notebook/Notebook.java#L866) resulting on keeping cron threads up running.

What is this PR for?\r\n\r\nImplemented **Spell** as one of Helium categories. *Technically, it's the frontend interpreter* runs on browser not backend.\r\n\r\nSpell can provide many benefits.\r\n\r\n1. Anyone can install, remove easily using helium package registry by #1936 \r\n2. Implementing spell is extremely easier rather than adding backend interpreter\r\n3. Can use existing javsacript libraries. (e.g [flowchart.js](http://flowchart.js.org/), [sequence diagram js](https://github.com/bramp/js-sequence-diagrams), ...). This enable us to add many visualization tools. Imagine that you can implement some custom interpreters with few lines of code like [flowchart-spell-example](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/compare/master...1ambda:ZEPPELIN-2008/introduce-spell?expand=1#diff-364845b20d68e4d94688e44fef03da98)\r\n4. The most important thing is, spell is not only interpreter but also display system. Because it runs on browser. So we can use spell display system with another spell **Display System with Spell** (see the screenshot section below)\r\n\r\n **In future**, we will be able to combine existing backend interpreters with spell like (**not supported in this PR cause we need to modify backend code a lot**)\r\n\r\n```\r\n// if we have markdown spell, we can use `%markdown` display in the spark interpreter\r\n\r\n%spark\r\n\r\nval calculated = doSomething()\r\nprintln(s\"%markdown _${calculated})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI added some examples. Checkout `echo`, `markdown`, `translator`, `flowchart` spells.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Feature]\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [x] - Add `SPELL` as one of Helium categories.\r\n* [x] - Implement

`HeliumBundleFactory`\r\n* [x] - Save spell rendering result into `note.json` while broadcasting to other websocket clients\r\n* [x] - Fix `renderText` for stream output\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n\r\n[ZEPPELIN-2008](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2008)\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n\r\n- Build `mvn clean package -Phelium-dev -Pexamples -DskipTests;`\r\n- Go to helium page `http://localhost:8080/#/helium`\r\n- Enable all spells\r\n- Go to a notebook and refresh\r\n- Follow actions in the screenshots below.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if

What is this PR for?\r\n`InterpreterFactory` searches for single `interpreter-settings.json` in some jar in folder. This PR allows us to have `interpreter-settings.json` in several jar in one interpreter folder.\r\n\r\nFor example, we can have `zeppelin-spark.jar` and `zeppelin-zrinterpreter.jar` in interpreter/spark folder, both with interpreter-settings.json. Zeppelin will load R settings only when `zeppelin-zrinterpreter.jar` exists.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Improvement]\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* Open an issue on Jira https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN/\r\n* Put link here, and add [ZEPPELIN-*Jira number*] in PR title, eg. [ZEPPELIN-533]\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? No\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\r\n* Does this needs documentation?

What is this PR for?\r\nAfter #1842 merged, anyone can create his/her own `VISUALIZATION` pkg as described in [Writing a new Visualization](https://zeppelin.apache.org/docs/0.7.0-SNAPSHOT/development/writingzeppelinvisualization.html) and can publish it to npm registry. The below img describes \"the current Helium package mechanism(black outline) + proposing from me to list all Helium pkgs published in npm registry(red one) in Zeppelin official website\".  So what I did to do this was the red-outlined factors. \r\n\r\n<img width=\"1266\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-01-24 at 4 44 42 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10060731/22238412/85ce0ee2-e254-11e6-9fe0-e5089789e61f.png\">\r\n\r\n> `helium.js` is located in here: [https://s3.amazonaws.com/helium-package/helium.js](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helium-package/helium.js) and it's updated automatically by CloudWatch every 1 hour.\r\n\r\n**Possible future work**\r\nCurrently to enable/disable the helium VIZ pkg via Helium GUI menu in Zeppelin, user needs to place Helium info json files under `ZEPPELIN_HOME/helium/` manually. But from now, we can substitute this not user friendly way by using `helium.js`. (already opened #1936 by @Leemoonsoo  )\r\n\r\n\r\n**Any issues?**\r\nBut as I mentioned in [ZEPPELIN-1973](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1973), since I used AWS services (Lambda, S3 and CloudWatch), I needed an account. So for continous management, I'm willing to share the information that need to run/packaging/deploy Lambda function with Zeppelin PMCs if you Zeppelin community thinks I need to do it. \r\n\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nImprovement | Feature\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [x] - make result filtered by type (`VISUALIZATION` & `SPELL` introduced by #1940 )\r\n* [x] - Adjust navbar when screen width is small \r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n[ZEPPELIN-1973](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1973)\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\nBuild `gh-pages` branch as described in [here](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/tree/gh-pages#build-website). Or just see the below gif sreenshot img :)\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if

`return 1` outside of function is not correct and gets ignored by shell interpreters, also it causes \r\nZeppelin to not catch situations when interpreter hasn't started, as shown in ZEPPELIN-1984.\r\nAs you can see Zeppelin got exit status of interpreter.sh as 0 when it had to be 1 (error). Zeppelin then starts a loop to try to connect interpreter process, and fails half a minute later with `connection refused`\r\n\r\n### What is this PR for?\r\nFix for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1984\r\n\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nBug Fix \r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [ ] - Task\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1984\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\nOn example of Spark interpreter, remove keytab file and keep --keytab reference to it in SPARK_SUBMIT_OPTIONS. Try to use Spark interpreter. spark-submit will fail with `Exception in thread \"main\" org.apache.spark.SparkException: Keytab file: /home/someuser/.kt does not exist` but Zeppelin (around [RemoteInterpreterManagedProcess.java](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/zeppelin-interpreter/src/main/java/org/apache/zeppelin/interpreter/remote/RemoteInterpreterManagedProcess.java#L121) ) wouldn't capture this problem (or many other problems starting interpreter process [as indicated here](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1984?focusedCommentId=15831000&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-15831000) )\r\n\r\nThis fix for ZEPPELIN-1984 would allow for error to be captured by RemoteInterpreterManagedProcess.java. \r\n\r\nA future improvement could be made, to carry forward exception from interpreter to RemoteInterpreterManagedProcess.java so end user could clearly see what's the problem, not just that the interpreter could not be started.\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update?\r\nNo\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions?\r\nNo\r\n* Does this needs documentation?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-20T21:33:27Z","updated_at":"2017-01-24T05:06:47Z","closed_at":"2017-01-24T05:06:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a2229188f550fa6a1dbb6da06a392449d9ac5d1a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1921/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1921/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1921/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/6624c79c1998a8ab3dfe9ad086ca459cec00c1ab","head":{"label":"Tagar:patch-1","ref":"patch-1","sha":"6624c79c1998a8ab3dfe9ad086ca459cec00c1ab","user":{"login":"Tagar","id":3013418,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMTM0MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3013418?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tagar","html_url":"https://github.com/Tagar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tagar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tagar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tagar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tagar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tagar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tagar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tagar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tagar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tagar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"7941d37518a9393435680833c0828b13c77dd863","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":32848140,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjg0ODE0MA==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"apache/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin","description":"Web-based

What is this PR for?\r\nWhen a interpreter is restarted, there is no feedback to user whether the action is received/honoured by zeppelin. This might also lead them to click restart multiple times, before they realize it has taken affect.\r\nAlso fixed a null bug.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Improvement + Bug fix]\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* None\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\nZEPPELIN-1983\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\nRestart a interpreter to test the positive case. The message should disappers on its own after sometime if not closed. A simple way to test the negative case is to stop the server and then try restarting.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n#### Positive case\r\n![positive
