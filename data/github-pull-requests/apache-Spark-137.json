I added new util functions `toSQLType()` to the trait `QueryErrorsBase`, and applied it in `Query.*Errors` (also modified tests in `Query.*ErrorsSuite`). For example:\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```sql\r\nCannot up cast b.`b` from decimal(38,18) to bigint.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n```sql\r\nCannot up cast b.`b` from DECIMAL(38,18) to BIGINT.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo improve user experience with Spark SQL. The changes highlight SQL types in error massages and make them more visible for users. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo since error classes haven't been released yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the modified test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *QueryParsingErrorsSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *QueryCompilationErrorsSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *QueryExecutionErrorsSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"testOnly *CastSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"testOnly *AnsiCastSuiteWithAnsiModeOn\"\r\n$

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nImprove the error messages for cast failures in ANSI.\r\nAs mentioned in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-38929, this PR targets two cast-to types: numeric types and date types.\r\n* For numeric(`int`, `smallint`, `double`, `float`, `decimal` ..) types, it embeds the cast-to types in the error message. For example, \r\n  ```\r\n  Invalid input value for type INT: '1.0'. To return NULL instead, use 'try_cast'. If necessary set %s to false to bypass this error.\r\n  ```\r\n  It uses the `toSQLType` and `toSQLValue` to wrap the corresponding types and literals.\r\n* For date types, it does similarly as above. For example, \r\n  ```\r\n  Invalid input value for type TIMESTAMP: 'a'. To return NULL instead, use 'try_cast'. If necessary set spark.sql.ansi.enabled to false to bypass this error.\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo improve the error message in general.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nIt changes the error messages.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThe related unit tests are updated.","created_at":"2022-04-18T04:57:36Z","updated_at":"2022-04-20T03:46:06Z","closed_at":"2022-04-19T19:25:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"baf36d5457a5022733c3bfdfac57437e13ae7944","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36241/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36241/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/36241/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ae43c19276d6842064ece4b9fb2529c8a364f9e9","head":{"label":"anchovYu:ansi-error-improve","ref":"ansi-error-improve","sha":"ae43c19276d6842064ece4b9fb2529c8a364f9e9","user":{"login":"anchovYu","id":25225043,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjI1MDQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25225043?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu","html_url":"https://github.com/anchovYu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":286528918,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODY1Mjg5MTg=","name":"spark","full_name":"anchovYu/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"anchovYu","id":25225043,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjI1MDQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25225043?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu","html_url":"https://github.com/anchovYu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/anchovYu/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR fixes the race conditions between the killTask() call and the launchTask() call that sometimes causes tasks not to be killed properly. If killTask() probes the map of pendingTasksLaunches before launchTask() has had a chance to put the corresponding task into that map, the kill flag will be lost and the subsequent launchTask() call will just proceed and run that task without knowing this task should be killed instead. The fix adds a kill mark during the killTask() call so that subsequent launchTask() can pick up the kill mark and call kill() on the TaskLauncher. If killTask() happens to happen after the task has finished and thus makes the kill mark useless, it will be cleaned up in a background thread.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nBug fix.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nAdded

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSimilar to SPARK-38847, this pr aims to release the `LevelDB/RocksDBIterator` resources earlier by using `tryWithResource`. The main change of this pr as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Use Java `tryWithResource` and Spark `Utils.tryWithResource` to recycling `KVStoreIterator` opened by `RocksDB.view(Class<T> type).iterator` and `RocksDB.view(Class<T> type).iterator`\r\n2. Introduce 4 new function for KVUtils(`count|foreach|mapToSeq|size`),  these function will close `KVStoreIterator` in time.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nRelease the `LevelDB/RocksDBIterator` resources earlier\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass

The tests should be skipped instead instead of showing failure. \r\n\r\n**BEFORE**\r\n```\r\n======================================================================\r\nERROR: test_take_on_jrdd_with_large_rows_should_not_cause_deadlock (pyspark.tests.test_rdd.RDDTests)\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \".../test_rdd.py\", line 723, in test_take_on_jrdd_with_large_rows_should_not_cause_deadlock\r\n    import numpy as np\r\nModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'numpy'\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nRan 1 test in 1.990s\r\n\r\nFAILED (errors=1)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**AFTER**\r\n```\r\nFinished test(python3.9): pyspark.tests.test_rdd RDDTests.test_take_on_jrdd_with_large_rows_should_not_cause_deadlock (1s) ... 1 tests were skipped\r\nTests passed in 1 seconds\r\n\r\nSkipped tests in pyspark.tests.test_rdd RDDTests.test_take_on_jrdd_with_large_rows_should_not_cause_deadlock with python3.9:\r\n    test_take_on_jrdd_with_large_rows_should_not_cause_deadlock (pyspark.tests.test_rdd.RDDTests) ... skipped 'NumPy or Pandas not installed'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass the CIs.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR changes the PrometheusServlet to not export gauges (or counters) with null values in the metric snapshot. Currently, we do export these gauges using the value `null` in the metric snapshot. This can cause Prometheus to fail when scraping the servlet, as null is not a valid floating point value.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nNull values are not valid floating point values. Prometheus will fail to scrape any metrics if a null value is part of the metrics snapshot. Such gauges can for instance be created with an uninitialized [DefaultSettableGauge](https://www.javadoc.io/static/io.dropwizard.metrics/metrics-core/4.2.0-beta.3/com/codahale/metrics/DefaultSettableGauge.html).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, gauges which are null are no longer exported. This is positive, as consumers of the metrics snapshots probably expect the snapshot to follow the [Prometheus text format](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exposition_formats/#text-format-details).\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nI've run the PrometheusServletSuite tests, and added a new test to verify that a gauge with a null value is not part of the metric snapshot.","created_at":"2022-04-17T16:58:01Z","updated_at":"2022-09-24T00:27:36Z","closed_at":"2022-09-24T00:27:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a4f37196583fe7376349d6b5c4d5b493475863c2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36234/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36234/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/36234/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0a5f1ea4fc98d6e1fb3355f702c952d9ea4c2f38","head":{"label":"jkylling:SPARK-38409","ref":"SPARK-38409","sha":"0a5f1ea4fc98d6e1fb3355f702c952d9ea4c2f38","user":{"login":"jkylling","id":6781076,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3ODEwNzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6781076?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkylling","html_url":"https://github.com/jkylling","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkylling/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkylling/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkylling/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkylling/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkylling/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkylling/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkylling/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkylling/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkylling/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":482572918,"node_id":"R_kgDOHMN6dg","name":"spark","full_name":"jkylling/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jkylling","id":6781076,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3ODEwNzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6781076?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkylling","html_url":"https://github.com/jkylling","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkylling/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkylling/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkylling/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkylling/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkylling/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkylling/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkylling/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkylling/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkylling/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jkylling/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to upper case SQL types in error messages similar to the SQL standard. I added new util functions `toSQLType()` to the trait `QueryErrorsBase`, and applied it in `Query.*Errors` (also modified tests in `Query.*ErrorsSuite`). For example:\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```sql\r\nCannot up cast b.`b` from decimal(38,18) to bigint.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n```sql\r\nCannot up cast b.`b` from DECIMAL(38,18) to BIGINT.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo improve user experience with Spark SQL. The changes highlight SQL types in error massages and make them more visible for users. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo since error classes haven't been released yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the modified test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *QueryParsingErrorsSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *QueryCompilationErrorsSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *QueryExecutionErrorsSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"testOnly *CastSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"testOnly *AnsiCastSuiteWithAnsiModeOn\"\r\n$

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nChange `EliminateOuterJoin#canFilterOutNull` to return `false` when a `where` condition throws an exception.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nConsider this query:\r\n```\r\nselect *\r\nfrom (select id, id as b from range(0, 10)) l\r\nleft outer join (select id, id + 1 as c from range(0, 10)) r\r\non l.id = r.id\r\nwhere assert_true(c > 0) is null;\r\n```\r\nThe query should succeed, but instead fails with\r\n```\r\njava.lang.RuntimeException: '(c#1L > cast(0 as bigint))' is not true!\r\n```\r\nThis happens even though there is no row where `c > 0` is false. \r\n\r\nThe `EliminateOuterJoin` rule checks if it can convert the outer join to a inner join based on the expression in the where clause, which in this case is\r\n```\r\nassert_true(c > 0) is null\r\n```\r\n`EliminateOuterJoin#canFilterOutNull` evaluates that expression with `c` set to `null` to see if the result is `null` or `false`. That rule doesn't expect the result to be a `RuntimeException`, but in this case it always is.\r\n\r\nThat is, the assertion is failing during optimization, not at run time.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit test.\r\n","created_at":"2022-04-17T00:16:07Z","updated_at":"2022-08-10T18:11:56Z","closed_at":"2022-04-25T05:49:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ce91f9ce0f0dc62d83abc4a6cb53b79a2a261d15","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36230/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36230/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/36230/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ffc174c876e34fbf3968f6b1bdfdbf400736e83d","head":{"label":"bersprockets:outer_join_eval_assert_issue","ref":"outer_join_eval_assert_issue","sha":"ffc174c876e34fbf3968f6b1bdfdbf400736e83d","user":{"login":"bersprockets","id":21131848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTMxODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21131848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets","html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":115567071,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTU1NjcwNzE=","name":"spark","full_name":"bersprockets/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bersprockets","id":21131848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTMxODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21131848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets","html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR updates `ProjectionOverSchema`  to use the outputs of the data source relation to filter the attributes in the nested schema pruning. This is needed because the attributes in the schema do not necessarily belong to the current data source relation. For example, if a filter contains a correlated subquery, then the subquery's children can contain attributes from both the inner query and the outer query. Since the `RewriteSubquery` batch happens after early scan pushdown rules, nested schema pruning can wrongly use the inner query's attributes to prune the outer query data schema, thus causing wrong results and unexpected exceptions.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo fix a bug in `SchemaPruning`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAllow user to insert specified columns into insertable view, for example, \r\n```\r\nCREATE TEMPORARY VIEW v1 (c1 int, c2 string) USING org.apache.spark.sql.json.DefaultSource OPTIONS (path 'json_dir')\r\nINSERT INTO v1(c1) VALUES(100)\r\nSELECT c1, c2 FROM v1;\r\n+---+----+\r\n| c1|  c2|\r\n+---+----+\r\n|100|null|\r\n+---+----+\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe option spark.sql.defaultColumn.useNullsForMissingDefautValues allows us to insert specified columns into table (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-38795), but currently this option does not work for insertable view, \r\n\r\nTo keep consistenct with the behavior of INSERT INTO table, we should also allow user to specify columns when running INSERT INTO view.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew unit tests added.","created_at":"2022-04-15T12:36:12Z","updated_at":"2022-05-08T00:41:16Z","closed_at":"2022-04-27T15:35:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b2b3bb0d2be4a6b44a07c08c6995f17a2030dfd5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36212/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36212/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/36212/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3cfe51b907f56c18d06cbf92a738df848e6503ff","head":{"label":"morvenhuang:SPARK-38914","ref":"SPARK-38914","sha":"3cfe51b907f56c18d06cbf92a738df848e6503ff","user":{"login":"morvenhuang","id":7865928,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4NjU5Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7865928?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/morvenhuang","html_url":"https://github.com/morvenhuang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morvenhuang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morvenhuang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morvenhuang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morvenhuang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morvenhuang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morvenhuang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morvenhuang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morvenhuang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morvenhuang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":459084771,"node_id":"R_kgDOG10T4w","name":"spark","full_name":"morvenhuang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"morvenhuang","id":7865928,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4NjU5Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7865928?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/morvenhuang","html_url":"https://github.com/morvenhuang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morvenhuang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morvenhuang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morvenhuang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morvenhuang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morvenhuang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morvenhuang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morvenhuang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morvenhuang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morvenhuang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/morvenhuang/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to use backticks to wrap SQL identifiers in error messages. I added new util functions `toSQLId()` to the trait `QueryErrorsBase`, and applied it in `Query.*Errors` (also modified tests in `Query.*ErrorsSuite`). For example:\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```sql\r\nInvalid SQL syntax: The definition of window win is repetitive.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n```\r\nInvalid SQL syntax: The definition of window `win` is repetitive.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo improve user experience with Spark SQL. The changes highlight SQL identifiers in error massages and make them more visible for users. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo since error classes haven't been released yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the affected test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *QueryParsingErrorsSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly

running all DAGSchedulerSuite one by one, since the SparkContext\r\nwill be initialized at the very beginning.\r\n\r\nThe root cause is the requested ResourceProfile is initialized before SparkContext,  consider below scenario\r\n\r\n```\r\nval ereqs = new ExecutorResourceRequests().cores(4)\r\nval treqs = new TaskResourceRequests().cpus(1)\r\nval rp1 = new ResourceProfileBuilder().require(ereqs).require(treqs).build\r\n\r\nval sc = new SparkContext(master, appName) \r\n```\r\n\r\nrp1 will take 0 as the resource profile id. But when SparkContext is initializing,\r\nthe default profile will also force the profile id to DEFAULT_RESOURCE_PROFILE_ID (0) which results in\r\ntwo different ResourceProfiles have the same id ( DEFAULT_RESOURCE_PROFILE_ID ).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo make the ResourceProfile robust. and to fix the potential issues\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR adds two optimization on the vectorized Parquet reader for complex types:\r\n- avoid allocating vectors for repetition and definition levels whenever can be applied\r\n- avoid reading definition levels whenever can be applied\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAt the moment, Spark will allocate vectors for repetition and definition levels, and also read definition levels even if it's not necessary, for instance, when reading primitive types. This may add extra memory footprint especially when reading wide tables. Therefore, we should avoid them if possible.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nExisting tests.","created_at":"2022-04-14T17:35:38Z","updated_at":"2022-05-04T16:38:53Z","closed_at":"2022-05-04T16:37:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4add0275952d2e4f7b17deb6b2e63273231089d1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36202/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36202/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/36202/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ab7e3c3c1e3a4badc23cef717e26854ba146723c","head":{"label":"sunchao:SPARK-38891","ref":"SPARK-38891","sha":"ab7e3c3c1e3a4badc23cef717e26854ba146723c","user":{"login":"sunchao","id":506679,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506679?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao","html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":29795757,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTc5NTc1Nw==","name":"spark","full_name":"sunchao/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sunchao","id":506679,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506679?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao","html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao/spark","description":"Mirror

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-38881\r\n\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nExposing a configuration option (metricsLevel) used for CloudWatch metrics reporting when consuming from an AWS Kinesis Stream, which is already available in Scala/Java Spark APIs\r\n\r\nThis relates to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-27420 which was merged as part of Spark 3.0.0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis change is desirable as it further exposes the metricsLevel config parameter that was added for the Scala/Java Spark APIs when working with the Kinesis Streaming integration, and makes it available to the PySpark API as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo. Default behavior of MetricsLevel.DETAILED is maintained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis change passes all tests, and local testing was done with a development Kinesis stream in AWS, in order to confirm that metrics were no longer being reported to CloudWatch after specifying MetricsLevel.NONE in the PySpark Kinesis streaming context creation, and also worked as it does today when leaving the MetricsLevel parameter out, which would result in a default of DETAILED, with CloudWatch metrics appearing again.\r\n\r\nBuilt with:\r\n```\r\n# ./build/mvn -pl :spark-streaming-kinesis-asl_2.12 -DskipTests -Pkinesis-asl clean install\r\n```\r\n\r\nTested with small pyspark kinesis streaming context + AWS kinesis stream, using updated streaming kinesis asl jar:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# spark-submit --packages org.apache.spark:spark-streaming-kinesis-asl_2.12:3.2.1 --jars spark/connector/kinesis-asl/target/spark-streaming-kinesis-asl_2.12-3.4.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n`ExternalShuffleBlockResolver`, `YarnShuffleService` and `RemoteBlockPushResolver` use `LevelDB` directly, this is not conducive to extending the use of `RocksDB` in this scenario. This pr is encapsulated for expansibility. It will be the pre-work of SPARK-38888, the main change as follows:\r\n\r\n- Introduce `DB` interface and implementation of corresponding `LevelDB` now, `RocksDB` implementation will be involved in the future\r\n- Introduce `DBBackend` enum and new config `SHUFFLE_SERVICE_DB_BACKEND` to specify a disk-based store used in shuffle service local db, only `LEVELDB` is supported now, `RocksDB` implementation will be involved in the future\r\n- Introduce `DBIterator` to traverse the items in the `DB`, only `LevelDBIterator` is supported now,  `RocksDBIterator` implementation will be involved in the future\r\n- Introduce `DBProvider` to initialization `DB`, it is only used to generate `LevelDB` now,  `RocksDB` implementation will be involved in the future\r\n- Change `StoreVersion` to top-level class, it will be reused by `RocksDB` implementation\r\n- Replace the directly use of `LevelDB` in `ExternalShuffleBlockResolver`, `YarnShuffleService` and `RemoteBlockPushResolver`  with `DB`\r\n- fix corresponding UTs and test tools\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis is pre work of SPARK-38888\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\n- Add new config `SHUFFLE_SERVICE_DB_BACKEND(spark.shuffle.service.db.backend)`, the new config use to use to specify a disk-based store used in shuffle service local db.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nMove test for the error class `WRITING_JOB_ABORTED` from `DataSourceV2Suite.scala` to `QueryExecutionErrorsSuite`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo improve code maintenance - all tests for error classes are placed to Query.*ErrorsSuite. Also the exception is raised from [QueryExecutionErrors](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/073fd2ad5c16d193725954e76ce357e4a9d97449/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/errors/QueryExecutionErrors.scala#L665-L670), so, tests should be in `QueryExecutionErrorsSuite` for consistency.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the affected test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/test:testOnly *QueryExecutionErrorsSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/test:testOnly

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe main change of this pr as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Use `Utils.tryWithResource` to recycling all  `KVStoreIterator` opened by `RocksDB.view(Class<T> type).iterator` and `RocksDB.view(Class<T> type).iterator`\r\n2. Remove the `finalize()` method from `LevelDB/RocksDB`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n1. Using `finalize()`  to recycle resources is not a good way, see Effective Java Item 7 `Avoid finalizers`\r\n2. `finalize()` is identified as `deprecated ` after Java 11 and `forRemoval=true` after

If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n- Override the isCanonicalizedPlan in AQEShuffleRead\r\n- cleanup unnecessary code\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAfter canonicalized, the child of AQEShuffleReadExec will be a exchange instead of shuffle query stage. For better maintenance, we can simply override the isCanonicalizedPlan and let famework to check if the plan can be executed.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno, jsut a small code refactor\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to remove the test coverage report for `pyspark.cloudpickle` (https://codecov.io/gh/apache/spark/tree/master/python/pyspark/cloudpickle).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`pyspark.cloudpickle` is actually a copy from [cloudpickle](https://github.com/cloudpipe/cloudpickle) as is. We don't need to check test coverage duplicately here.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, dev-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested, and verified the site and console output:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncd python\r\n./run-tests-with-coverage --python-executables=python3 --modules=pyspark-sql\r\n```\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\nopen

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nMake `NewInstance` non-foldable.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWhen handling Java beans as input, Spark creates `NewInstance` with no arguments. On master and 3.3, `NewInstance` with no arguments is considered foldable. As a result, the `ConstantFolding` rule converts `NewInstance` into a `Literal` holding an instance of the user's specified Java bean. The instance becomes a singleton that gets reused for each input record (although its fields get updated by `InitializeJavaBean`).\r\n\r\nBecause the instance gets reused, sometimes multiple buffers in `AggregationIterator` are actually referring to the same Java bean instance.\r\n\r\nTake, for example, the test I added in this PR, or the `spark-shell` example I added to SPARK-38823 as a comment.\r\n\r\nThe input is:\r\n```\r\n    new Item(\"a\", 1),\r\n    new Item(\"b\", 3),\r\n    new Item(\"c\", 2),\r\n    new Item(\"a\", 7)\r\n```\r\nAs `ObjectAggregationIterator` reads the input, the buffers get set up as follows (note that the first field of Item should be the same as the key):\r\n```\r\n- Read Item(\"a\", 1)\r\n\r\n- Buffers are now:\r\n  Key \"a\" --> Item(\"a\", 1)\r\n\r\n- Read Item(\"b\", 3)\r\n\r\n- Buffers are now:\r\n  Key \"a\" -> Item(\"b\", 3)\r\n  Key \"b\" -> Item(\"b\", 3)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe buffer for key \"a\" now contains `Item(\"b\", 3)`. That's because both buffers contain a reference to the same Item instance, and that Item instance's fields were updated when `Item(\"b\", 3)` was read.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes `NewInstance` non-foldable, so it will not get optimized away, thus ensuring a new instance of the Java bean for each input record.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit test.\r\n","created_at":"2022-04-13T19:38:27Z","updated_at":"2022-08-10T18:17:46Z","closed_at":"2022-04-14T23:37:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1b2f1f4eab5c0c1e7b10d9abf24826d3a7cacf19","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36183/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36183/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/36183/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/712d3ba8069a1997652adff8c95b61d829fee101","head":{"label":"bersprockets:newinstance_issue","ref":"newinstance_issue","sha":"712d3ba8069a1997652adff8c95b61d829fee101","user":{"login":"bersprockets","id":21131848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTMxODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21131848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets","html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":115567071,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTU1NjcwNzE=","name":"spark","full_name":"bersprockets/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bersprockets","id":21131848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTMxODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21131848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets","html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nEnhance the selection of `SortMergeJoin` streamed side and buffered side in `JoinSelection`, so that we can get a buffered side for better performance. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFor an inner join type SortMergeJoin, it always uses the left side as streamed side and right side as buffered side.\r\n\r\nAccoirding to the implementaion of SortMergeJoin, we expect the buffered side to be:\r\n\r\n- smaller than streamed side\r\n- has less duplicate data\r\n\r\nWe do not know whether the join will be SortMergeJoin at logical phase, so it should do this selection at physcial phase.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT * FROM (\r\n  SELECT c1 FROM a GROUP BY c1 \r\n) t1 JOIN t2 ON t1.c1 = t2.c2\r\n```\r\nWe can make t1 as the buffered side if its statistics size less than t2.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nThe plan may be changed and improve the performance.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nadd

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWholeStageCodegenExec is wrapped in BufferedRowIterator.\r\n\r\nBufferedRowIterator uses a LinkedList to hold the output of WholeStageCodegenExec.\r\n\r\nWhen the parent of SortMergeJoin cannot codegen, SortMergeJoin needs to append the output to this LinkedList.\r\n\r\nSortMergeJoin processes a record in streamedPlan each time. If all records in bufferedPlan can match this record, all records in bufferedPlan will be saved in LinkedList, resulting in OOM.\r\n\r\nThe above situation is very common in our internal use, so it is best to add a configuration to the codegen code. If there are enough items in the LinkedList, stop SortMergeJoin and let the parent consume it first.\r\n\r\n### benchmark case1: this test case is from JoinBenchmark\r\n```scala\r\ndef

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nWhen the reverse proxy URL contains \"proxy\" or \"history\", the application ID in UI is wrongly parsed.\r\nFor example, if we set spark.ui.reverseProxyURL as \"/test/proxy/prefix\" or \"/test/history/prefix\", the application ID is parsed as \"prefix\" and the related API calls will fail in stages/executors pages:\r\n```\r\n.../api/v1/applications/prefix/allexecutors\r\n```\r\ninstead of\r\n```\r\n.../api/v1/applications/app-20220413142241-0000/allexecutors\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are more contexts in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/31774\r\nWe can fix this entirely like https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/36174, but it is risky and complicated to do that.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAvoid users setting keywords in reverse proxy URL and getting wrong UI results.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nA new unit test.\r\nAlso doc preview:\r\n<img width=\"1743\" alt=\"image\"

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nMove test for the error class `NON_PARTITION_COLUMN` from `InsertIntoSQLOnlyTests` to `QueryCompilationErrorsDSv2Suite`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo improve code maintenance - all tests for error classes are placed to Query.*ErrorsSuite. Also exception are raised from [QueryCompilationErrors](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/bf75b495e18ed87d0c118bfd5f1ceb52d720cad9/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/errors/QueryCompilationErrors.scala#L100-L104), so, tests should be in `QueryCompilationErrorsDSv2Suite` for consistency.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR is to show how tricky it is to allow keywords \"proxy\" or \"history\" in reverse proxy URL. I suggest to forbid the keywords instead of support it. See PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/36176\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nWhen the reverse proxy URL contains \"proxy\" or \"history\", the application ID in UI is wrongly parsed.\r\nFor example, if we set `spark.ui.reverseProxyURL` as \"/test/proxy/prefix\" or \"/test/history/prefix\", the application ID is parsed as \"prefix\" and the related API calls will fail in stages/executors pages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n","created_at":"2022-04-13T07:03:31Z","updated_at":"2022-06-07T10:56:40Z","closed_at":"2022-06-07T10:56:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2b93ec8188e42414bf1fd029d81051477d1d52a1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605079,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDc5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/WEB%20UI","name":"WEB

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR cherry-picks https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/36065 to branch-3.2.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWhen calling a Python UDF on a DataFrame with large rows, a deadlock can occur involving the following three threads:\r\n\r\n1. The Scala task executor thread. During task execution, this is responsible for reading output produced by the Python process. However, in this case the task has finished early, and this thread is no longer reading output produced by the Python process. Instead, it is waiting for the Scala WriterThread to exit so that it can finish the task.\r\n2. The Scala WriterThread. This is trying to send a large row to the Python process, and is waiting for the Python process to read that row.\r\n3. The Python process. This is trying to send a large output to the Scala task executor thread, and is waiting for that thread to read that output, which will never happen.\r\n\r\nWe considered the following three solutions for the deadlock:\r\n\r\n1. When the task completes, make the Scala task executor thread close the socket before waiting for the Scala WriterThread to exit. If the WriterThread is blocked on a large write, this would interrupt that write and allow the WriterThread to exit. However, it would prevent Python worker reuse.\r\n2. Modify PythonWorkerFactory to use interruptible I/O. [java.nio.channels.SocketChannel](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/nio/channels/SocketChannel.html#write(java.nio.ByteBuffer)) supports interruptible blocking operations. The goal is that when the WriterThread is interrupted, it should exit even if it was blocked on a large write. However, this would be invasive.\r\n3. Add a watchdog thread similar to the existing PythonRunner.MonitorThread to detect this deadlock and kill the Python worker. The MonitorThread currently kills the Python worker only if the task itself is interrupted. In this case, the task completes normally, so the MonitorThread does not take action. We want the new watchdog thread (WriterMonitorThread) to detect that the task is completed but the Python writer thread has not stopped, indicating a deadlock.\r\n\r\nThis PR implements Option 3.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo fix a deadlock that can cause PySpark queries to hang.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded a test that previously encountered the deadlock and timed out, and now succeeds.","created_at":"2022-04-13T04:53:39Z","updated_at":"2024-01-15T00:53:34Z","closed_at":"2022-04-13T07:58:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5d485d3814579654beebb305d400087b0079ed13","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36172/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36172/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/36172/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f8d0ea25f45cccd8f10ec745d68492d0e9be2559","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-38677-3.2","ref":"SPARK-38677-3.2","sha":"f8d0ea25f45cccd8f10ec745d68492d0e9be2559","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFixes usage logger attachment to handle static methods properly.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe usage logger attachment logic

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-38881\r\n\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nExposing a configuration option (metricsLevel) used for CloudWatch metrics reporting when consuming from an AWS Kinesis Stream, which is already available in Scala/Java Spark APIs\r\n\r\nThis relates to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-27420 which was merged as part of Spark 3.0.0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis change is desirable as it further exposes the metricsLevel config parameter that was added for the Scala/Java Spark APIs when working with the Kinesis Streaming integration, and makes it available to the PySpark API as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo. Default behavior of MetricsLevel.DETAILED is maintained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis change passes all tests, and local testing was done with a development Kinesis stream in AWS, in order to confirm that metrics were no longer being reported to CloudWatch after specifying MetricsLevel.NONE in the PySpark Kinesis streaming context creation, and also worked as it does today when leaving the MetricsLevel parameter out, which would result in a default of DETAILED, with CloudWatch metrics appearing again.\r\n\r\nBuilt with:\r\n```\r\n# ./build/mvn -pl :spark-streaming-kinesis-asl_2.12 -DskipTests -Pkinesis-asl clean install\r\n```\r\n\r\nTested with small pyspark kinesis streaming context + AWS kinesis stream, using updated streaming kinesis asl jar:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# spark-submit --packages org.apache.spark:spark-streaming-kinesis-asl_2.12:3.2.1 --jars spark/connector/kinesis-asl/target/spark-streaming-kinesis-asl_2.12-3.4.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, the mechanism of speculation is as follows:\r\n1. The number of successful tasks more than spark.speculation.quantile(default is 0.75) * numTasks.\r\n2. When some unsuccessful tasks run for more than spark.speculation.multiplier( default is 1.5) * medianDuration, they will speculate.\r\n\r\nThe mechanism means that it will be the last 10% of the tasks subject to speculate, as long as above conditions are met.\r\n\r\nFor example: A reduce stage whose TaskSet's size is 10, and the TaskSet state is  as follows:\r\n\r\ntaskIndex | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9\r\n-- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | --\r\nAll   records need to deal with | 10000 | 10000 | 10000 | 10000 | 10000 | 10000 | 10000 | 10000 | 18000 | 18000\r\nRecords   that have been processed | 10000 | 10000 | 10000 | 10000 | 10000 | 10000 | 10000 | 10000 | 11000 | 15000\r\nrunTime(seconds) | 20 | 20 | 20 | 20 | 20 | 20 | 20 | 20 | 30 | 30\r\nprogressRate（Records   that have been processed/runTime） | 500 | 500 | 500 | 500 | 500 | 500 | 500 | 500 | 183.33 | 500\r\ncompleted | true | true | true | true | true | true | true | true | false | false\r\n\r\nIn the current speculation mechanism, both taskIndex 8 and taskIndex 9 will speculate, however, only taskIndex 8 needs to speculate, because only taskIndex 8 is inefficient.\r\n\r\nIn our production, there are more than 110 million speculation tasks every day, but only 30% of speculation tasks are successful finally. To analysis the unsuccessful speculation tasks, and found that the original tasks of speculation are more efficient, which might be unnecessary to speculate at all.  The unnecessary speculative tasks not only waste cluster resources but also interfere with the scheduling of other tasks.\r\n\r\nThis pr will try to improve the speculation through the stage task metrics. We use stage task metrics(inputMetrics and shuffleReadMetrics) and task runtimes to evaluate the efficiency of task processing, and  evaluate the inefficient tasks by measuring successful ones , and only need to speculate the inefficient tasks.  With this pr,  we may only speculate the taskIndex 8 in the example above,  which makes more sense and helps optimize cluster resources.\r\n\r\nIn addition, in order to avoid regression, we should try to speculate as much as possible for long-running tasks.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nImprove the speculation.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd unittests.\r\n","created_at":"2022-04-12T11:23:25Z","updated_at":"2023-08-21T11:24:48Z","closed_at":"2022-06-29T05:39:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"dce3feeba53e7dabed030513c7aedc39eb36a8dd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36162/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36162/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/36162/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/24d3937a663103ba23e294587cdf8b44fe6616ee","head":{"label":"weixiuli:improve-speculation","ref":"improve-speculation","sha":"24d3937a663103ba23e294587cdf8b44fe6616ee","user":{"login":"weixiuli","id":39684231,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5Njg0MjMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39684231?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli","html_url":"https://github.com/weixiuli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":140506691,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDA1MDY2OTE=","name":"spark","full_name":"weixiuli/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"weixiuli","id":39684231,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5Njg0MjMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39684231?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli","html_url":"https://github.com/weixiuli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/weixiuli/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn Scala, SparkSession.builder returns a new builder each time,\r\nbut in Python, it returns the same builder every time, with the\r\nsame static options.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, whenever SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate() is called,\r\nthe options set in the very first builder are reapplied.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, I introduce a @classproperty decorator, that is similar\r\nto the @property decorator, except that it works with class methods.\r\nNow, whenever `SparkSession.builder` is called, a new builder is\r\nreturned as expected.\r\n\r\nI also made the parameter `Builder._options` non-static, and I removed\r\n`Builder._sc` which didn't seem used anymore.\r\n\r\n`Builder._sc` was introduced in this commit:\r\n58419b92673c46911c25bc6c6b13397f880c6424\r\n\r\nAnd it's only use seems to have been removed by this commit:\r\n88696ebcb72fd3057b1546831f653b29b7e0abb2\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI updated the Doctests for SparkSession.Builder.getOrCreate and added\r\nDoctests on the classproperty decorator as well.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThanks for sending a pull request!

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the configuration flag `spark.sql.parquet.timestampNTZ.enabled` which allows to read and write `TIMESTAMP_NTZ` values in Parquet and is enabled by default.\r\n\r\nPreviously the usage of `TIMESTAMP_NTZ` was hardcoded so there was no way to restore the original behaviour of reading values as `TIMESTAMP_LTZ`. This PR addresses the issue - when the config is disabled, all `TIMESTAMP_NTZ` values will be read as `TIMESTAMP_LTZ` and writes would fail with an unsupported type error (and will have to be cast to a different type).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nAllows users to fall back to reading Parquet types TIMESTAMP_MICROS and TIMESTAMP_MILLIS with UTC offset disabled as `TIMESTAMP_LTZ`. Note that the users must explicitly disable the config - by default we would read such Parquet types as `TIMESTAMP_NTZ`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, users have the ability to disable `TIMESTAMP_NTZ` support in Parquet data source.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI updated a few unit tests to check the behaviour of the config

ANSI SQL allows double-quoted strings for identifiers.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds support for double-quoted identifiers for named expressions (column aliases) without changing the use of double-quoted strings as SQL strings in other contexts. Backticks are also still supported.\r\n\r\nSpecific changes:\r\n\r\n- Split `STRING` lexer rule into `SINGLE_QUOTED_STRING` and `DOUBLE_QUOTED_STRING`\r\n- Update most parser rules to allow `SINGLE_QUOTED_STRING` or `DOUBLE_QUOTED_STRING` instead of `STRING`\r\n- Update parser rule for `namedExpression` to allow `quotedIdentifier` (backticks) or `DOUBLE_QUOTED_STRING`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTo allow ANSI SQL double-quoted identifiers to be used for column aliases.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, it allows double quotes to be used as well as backticks for named expressions.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNew UT added.\r\n","created_at":"2022-04-11T23:34:30Z","updated_at":"2022-09-26T00:25:53Z","closed_at":"2022-09-26T00:25:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1fb96443c24985a6467a776a638b30f89e2e0e29","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36151/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/36151/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/36151/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/73a7e537b6473e053a2fed263ed79d1138c9697e","head":{"label":"andygrove:double-quoted-identifiers-alt","ref":"double-quoted-identifiers-alt","sha":"73a7e537b6473e053a2fed263ed79d1138c9697e","user":{"login":"andygrove","id":934084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkzNDA4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/934084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove","html_url":"https://github.com/andygrove","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":205463461,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDU0NjM0NjE=","name":"spark","full_name":"andygrove/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"andygrove","id":934084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkzNDA4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/934084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove","html_url":"https://github.com/andygrove","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/andygrove/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis proposes a Scala implementation of the `melt` (aka. `unpivot`) operation.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe Scala Dataset API provides the `pivot` operation, but not its reverse operation `unpivot` or `melt`. The `melt` operation is part of the [Pandas API](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.melt.html), which is why this method is provided by PySpark Pandas API, implemented purely in Python.\r\n\r\n[It should be implemented in Scala](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/26912#pullrequestreview-332975715) to make this operation available to Scala / Java, SQL, PySpark, and to reuse the implementation in PySpark Pandas APIs.\r\n\r\nThe `melt` / `unpivot` operation exists in other systems like [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax#unpivot_operator), [T-SQL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/queries/from-using-pivot-and-unpivot?view=sql-server-ver15#unpivot-example), [Oracle](https://www.oracletutorial.com/oracle-basics/oracle-unpivot/).\r\n\r\nIt supports expressions for ids and value columns including `*` expansion and structs. So this also fixes / includes SPARK-39292.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nIt adds `melt` to the `Dataset` API (Scala and Java).\r\n\r\n### How was this patch
