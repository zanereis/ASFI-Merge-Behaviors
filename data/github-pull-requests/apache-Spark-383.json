What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR adds support for inferring an additional set of data constraints based on attribute equality. For e.g., if an operator has constraints of the form (`a = 5`, `a = b`), we can now automatically infer an additional constraint of the form `b = 5`\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nTested that new constraints are properly inferred for filters (by adding a new test) and equi-joins (by modifying an existing test)\n","created_at":"2016-03-09T23:47:40Z","updated_at":"2016-03-11T18:56:35Z","closed_at":"2016-03-11T01:31:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ebe3c83b40c21362da84b6290036360ddeae9e9b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11618/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11618/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11618/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c57db5b4a3950ba5e653ff3b8cdfa33e157305ef","head":{"label":"sameeragarwal:infer-isequal-constraints","ref":"infer-isequal-constraints","sha":"c57db5b4a3950ba5e653ff3b8cdfa33e157305ef","user":{"login":"sameeragarwal","id":166454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NjQ1NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/166454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal","html_url":"https://github.com/sameeragarwal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":20599564,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDU5OTU2NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"sameeragarwal/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sameeragarwal","id":166454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NjQ1NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/166454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal","html_url":"https://github.com/sameeragarwal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sameeragarwal/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nAs each acceptor/selector in Jetty will use one thread, the number of threads should at least be the number of acceptors and selectors plus 1. Otherwise, the thread pool of Jetty server may be exhausted by acceptors/selectors and not be able to response any request.\n\nTo avoid wasting threads, the PR limits the max number of acceptors and selectors and also updates the max thread number if necessary.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nJust make sure we don't break any existing

patch refactors the MemoryStore to remove the concept of `pendingUnrollMemory`. It also fixes fixes SPARK-6157: \"Unrolling with MEMORY_AND_DISK should always release memory\".\n\nKey changes:\n- Inline `MemoryStore.tryToPut` at its three call sites in the `MemoryStore`.\n- Inline `Memory.unrollSafely` at its only call site (in `MemoryStore.putIterator`).\n- Inline `MemoryManager.acquireStorageMemory` at its call sites.\n- Simplify the code as a result of this inlining (some parameters have fixed values after inlining, so lots of branches can be removed).\n- Remove the `pendingUnrollMemory` map by returning the amount of unrollMemory allocated when returning an iterator after a failed `putIterator` call.\n- Change `putIterator` to return an instance of `PartiallyUnrolledIterator`, a special iterator subclass which will automatically free the unroll memory of its partially-unrolled elements when the iterator is consumed. To handle cases where the iterator is not consumed (e.g. when a MEMORY_ONLY put fails), `PartiallyUnrolledIterator` exposes a `close()` method which may be called to discard the unrolled values and free their memory.\n","created_at":"2016-03-09T21:42:45Z","updated_at":"2016-03-14T21:28:56Z","closed_at":"2016-03-14T21:28:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8678764155dd4447de521bdc5934b0e18ec72ca0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11613/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11613/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11613/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/319fb55b5f9b2ecf3cc58ce3ad812e365943bf54","head":{"label":"JoshRosen:cleanup-unroll-memory","ref":"cleanup-unroll-memory","sha":"319fb55b5f9b2ecf3cc58ce3ad812e365943bf54","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22238710,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIzODcxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"JoshRosen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nTo maximize locality, the YarnAllocator would cancel any requests with a\nstale locality preference or no locality preference. This assumed that\nthe majority of tasks had locality preferences, but may not be the case\nwhen scanning S3. This caused container requests for S3 tasks to be\nconstantly cancelled and resubmitted.\n\nThis changes the allocator's logic to cancel only stale requests and\njust enough requests without locality preferences to submit requests\nwith locality preferences. This avoids cancelling requests without\nlocality preferences that would be resubmitted without locality\npreferences.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nWe've deployed this patch on our clusters and verified that jobs that couldn't get executors because they kept canceling and resubmitting requests are fixed. Large jobs are running fine.\n","created_at":"2016-03-09T21:02:37Z","updated_at":"2016-03-14T18:41:01Z","closed_at":"2016-03-14T18:25:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"00b84f1fde3dce4b86f048dd507307e9c7a5786a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11612/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11612/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11612/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9aea3b13480381310442eadc41e285b6036c2e63","head":{"label":"rdblue:SPARK-13779-fix-yarn-allocator-requests","ref":"SPARK-13779-fix-yarn-allocator-requests","sha":"9aea3b13480381310442eadc41e285b6036c2e63","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":26284539,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjI4NDUzOQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"rdblue/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\n\"normal\" solver in LinearRegression uses Cholesky decomposition to calculate the coefficients. If the data has features with identical values (zero variance), then (A^T A) matrix is not positive definite any more and the Cholesky decomposition fails.\n\nSince A^T.A and features variances are calculated in single pass, it's better to modify ATA instead to re-calculating it from the data after dropping constant columns. In this PR, I'm dropping columns and rows from ATA corresponding to features with zero variance. Then the cholesky decomposition can be performed without any problem.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nA unit test under LineatReagessionSuite is added which compares results from this change and l-bgfs solver to glmnet. All these are now consistent.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nAsking the metastore to filter partitions with {{getPartitionsByFilter}} can silently fail (that is, incorrectly returns no partitions, without reporting any error) when there are lots of partitions.  As a partial workaround, when the filter criteria is only equality, we can use {{getPartitions(..., partitionSpec)}} which doesn't appear to have this issue.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\njenkins unit tests.  (Note: existing tests are insufficient at this point, needs more before merging.  Also doesn't have a repro of the original

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-13766\nThis PR makes the file extensions (written by internal datasource) consistent.\n\n**Before**\n- TEXT, CSV and JSON \n\n```\n[.COMPRESSION_CODEC_NAME]\n```\n- Parquet \n\n```\n[.COMPRESSION_CODEC_NAME].parquet\n```\n- ORC\n\n```\n.orc\n```\n\n**After**\n- TEXT, CSV and JSON \n\n```\n.txt[.COMPRESSION_CODEC_NAME]\n.csv[.COMPRESSION_CODEC_NAME]\n.json[.COMPRESSION_CODEC_NAME]\n```\n- Parquet \n\n```\n[.COMPRESSION_CODEC_NAME].parquet\n```\n- ORC\n\n```\n[.COMPRESSION_CODEC_NAME].orc\n```\n\nWhen the compression codec is set,\n- For Parquet and ORC, each still stays in Parquet and ORC format but just have compressed data internally. So, I think it is okay to name `.parquet` and `.orc` at the end.\n- For Text, CSV and JSON, each does not stays in each format but it has different data format according to compression codec. So, each has the names `.json`, `.csv` and `.txt` before the compression extension.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit tests are used and `./dev/run_tests` for coding style tests.\n","created_at":"2016-03-09T09:41:28Z","updated_at":"2016-10-01T06:42:39Z","closed_at":"2016-03-10T03:14:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"dfb60471aaa71bc7d37eb444ca8740a2d6d26063","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11604/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11604/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11604/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7568744a1ea4601e8cd5a07427610c321e5537f4","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-13766","ref":"SPARK-13766","sha":"7568744a1ea4601e8cd5a07427610c321e5537f4","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently in Spark on YARN, configurations can be passed through SparkConf, env and command arguments, some parts are duplicated, like client argument and SparkConf. So here propose to simplify the command arguments.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nThis patch is tested manually with unit test.\n\nCC @vanzin @tgravescs , please help to suggest this proposal. The original purpose of this JIRA is to remove `ClientArguments`, through refactoring some arguments like `--class`, `--arg` are not so easy to replace, so here I remove the most part of command line arguments, only keep the minimal set.\n","created_at":"2016-03-09T09:05:35Z","updated_at":"2016-04-01T17:54:08Z","closed_at":"2016-04-01T17:54:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b865e57f0260e2b996c18fe921ca12fbc9382b46","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11603/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11603/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11603/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3bb44b4b1b84f9a972ad8ea4876b70369ba07d0c","head":{"label":"jerryshao:SPARK-12343","ref":"SPARK-12343","sha":"3bb44b4b1b84f9a972ad8ea4876b70369ba07d0c","user":{"login":"jerryshao","id":850797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDc5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/850797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao","html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18259371,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODI1OTM3MQ==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"jerryshao/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jerryshao","id":850797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDc5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/850797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao","html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nAs shown in another PR: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/11596, we are using `SELECT 1` as a dummy table, when the table is used for SQL statements in which a table reference is required, but the contents of the table are not important. For example,\n\n``` SQL\nSELECT value FROM (select 1) dummyTable Lateral View explode(array(1,2,3)) adTable as value\n```\n\nBefore the PR, the optimized plan contains a useless `Project` after Optimizer executing the `ColumnPruning` rule, as shown below:\n\n```\n== Analyzed Logical Plan ==\nvalue: int\nProject [value#22]\n+- Generate explode(array(1, 2, 3)), true, false, Some(adtable), [value#22]\n   +- SubqueryAlias dummyTable\n      +- Project [1 AS 1#21]\n         +- OneRowRelation$\n\n== Optimized Logical Plan ==\nGenerate explode([1,2,3]), false, false, Some(adtable), [value#22]\n+- Project\n   +- OneRowRelation$\n```\n\nAfter the fix, the optimized plan removed the useless `Project`, as shown below:\n\n```\n== Optimized Logical Plan ==\nGenerate explode([1,2,3]), false, false, Some(adtable), [value#22]\n+- OneRowRelation$\n```\n\nThis PR is to remove `Project` when its Child's output is Nil\n#### How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded a new unit test case into the suite `ColumnPruningSuite.scala`\n","created_at":"2016-03-09T04:24:36Z","updated_at":"2016-03-09T18:31:09Z","closed_at":"2016-03-09T18:31:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"868015ba732ed4b0fe6325ca18e39ade1d9314dc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11599/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11599/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11599/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/68decd1729eb7023dc1c24efa2e8fbef7011f698","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:projectOneRowRelation","ref":"projectOneRowRelation","sha":"68decd1729eb7023dc1c24efa2e8fbef7011f698","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

have a recoverable Spark streaming job with checkpoint enabled, it could be executed correctly at first time, but throw following exception when restarted and recovered from checkpoint.\n\n```\norg.apache.spark.SparkException: RDD transformations and actions can only be invoked by the driver, not inside of other transformations; for example, rdd1.map(x => rdd2.values.count() * x) is invalid because the values transformation and count action cannot be performed inside of the rdd1.map transformation. For more information, see SPARK-5063.\n    at org.apache.spark.rdd.RDD.org$apache$spark$rdd$RDD$$sc(RDD.scala:87)\n    at org.apache.spark.rdd.RDD.withScope(RDD.scala:352)\n    at org.apache.spark.rdd.RDD.union(RDD.scala:565)\n    at org.apache.spark.streaming.Repo$$anonfun$createContext$1.apply(Repo.scala:23)\n    at org.apache.spark.streaming.Repo$$anonfun$createContext$1.apply(Repo.scala:19)\n    at org.apache.spark.streaming.dstream.DStream$$anonfun$foreachRDD$1$$anonfun$apply$mcV$sp$3.apply(DStream.scala:627)\n```\n\nAccording to exception, it shows I invoked transformations and actions in other transformations, but I did not. The real reason is that I used external RDD in DStream operation. External RDD data is not stored in checkpoint, so that during recovering, the initial value of _sc in this RDD is assigned to null and hit above exception. But you can find the error message is misleading, it indicates nothing about the real issue\nHere is the code to reproduce it.\n\n``` scala\nobject Repo {\n\n  def createContext(ip: String, port: Int, checkpointDirectory: String):StreamingContext = {\n\n    println(\"Creating new context\")\n    val sparkConf = new SparkConf().setAppName(\"Repo\").setMaster(\"local[2]\")\n    val ssc = new StreamingContext(sparkConf, Seconds(2))\n    ssc.checkpoint(checkpointDirectory)\n\n    var cached = ssc.sparkContext.parallelize(Seq(\"apple, banana\"))\n\n    val words = ssc.socketTextStream(ip, port).flatMap(_.split(\" \"))\n    words.foreachRDD((rdd: RDD[String]) => {\n      val res = rdd.map(word => (word, word.length)).collect()\n      println(\"words: \" + res.mkString(\", \"))\n\n      cached = cached.union(rdd)\n      cached.checkpoint()\n      println(\"cached words: \" + cached.collect.mkString(\", \"))\n    })\n    ssc\n  }\n\n  def main(args: Array[String]) {\n\n    val ip = \"localhost\"\n    val port = 9999\n    val dir = \"/home/maowei/tmp\"\n\n    val ssc = StreamingContext.getOrCreate(dir,\n      () => {\n        createContext(ip, port, dir)\n      })\n    ssc.start()\n    ssc.awaitTermination()\n

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR adds support for inferring `IsNotNull` constraints from expressions with an `!==`. More specifically, if an operator has a condition on `a !== b`, we know that both `a` and `b` in the operator output can no longer be null.\n## How was this patch tested?\n1. Modified a test in `ConstraintPropagationSuite` to test for expressions with an inequality.\n2. Added a test in `NullFilteringSuite` for making sure an Inner join with a \"non-equal\" condition appropriately filters out null from their input.\n\ncc @nongli

of looking for a specially-named assembly, the scripts now will\nblindly add all jars under the libs directory to the classpath. This\nlibs directory is still currently the old assembly dir, so things should\nkeep working the same way as before until we make more packaging changes.\n\nThe only lost feature is the detection of multiple assemblies; I consider\nthat a minor nicety that only really affects few developers, so it's probably\nok.\n\nTested locally by running spark-shell; also did some minor Win32 testing\n(just made sure spark-shell started).\n","created_at":"2016-03-08T23:26:31Z","updated_at":"2016-03-14T21:29:53Z","closed_at":"2016-03-14T18:15:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"539316f4d93c7cbef8b9f5fd1b9c1266836d6fea","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11591/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11591/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11591/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/cc28749aaa4fdbaf49418ff4cbd4572dad25be07","head":{"label":"vanzin:SPARK-13578","ref":"SPARK-13578","sha":"cc28749aaa4fdbaf49418ff4cbd4572dad25be07","user":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18302272,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODMwMjI3Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"vanzin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin/spark","description":"Mirror

Motivation\n\nCSV data source was contributed by Databricks. It is the inlined version of https://github.com/databricks/spark-csv. The data source name was `com.databricks.spark.csv`. As a result there are many tables created on older versions of spark with that name as the source. For backwards compatibility we should keep the old name.\n## Proposed changes\n\n`com.databricks.spark.csv` was added to list of `backwardCompatibilityMap` in `ResolvedDataSource.scala`\n## Tests\n\nA unit test was added to `CSVSuite` to parse a csv file using the old name.\n","created_at":"2016-03-08T22:43:04Z","updated_at":"2016-03-09T01:46:43Z","closed_at":"2016-03-09T01:46:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ff7fa978dfda04b56bf991b00d2b17e672a25c39","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11589/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11589/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11589/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4e891bf7f27f2b65d22e04dcd7aca5d7a1dc277e","head":{"label":"falaki:SPARK-13754","ref":"SPARK-13754","sha":"4e891bf7f27f2b65d22e04dcd7aca5d7a1dc277e","user":{"login":"falaki","id":512364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMjM2NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/512364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/falaki","html_url":"https://github.com/falaki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/falaki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/falaki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/falaki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/falaki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/falaki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/falaki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/falaki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/falaki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/falaki/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18185658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODE4NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"falaki/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"falaki","id":512364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMjM2NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/512364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/falaki","html_url":"https://github.com/falaki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/falaki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/falaki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/falaki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/falaki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/falaki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/falaki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/falaki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/falaki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/falaki/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/falaki/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR improve the codegen of Filter by:\n1. filter out the rows early if it have null value in it that will cause the condition result in null or false. After this, we could simplify the condition, because the input are not nullable anymore.\n2. Split the condition as conjunctive predicates, then check them one by one.\n\nHere is a piece of generated code for Filter in TPCDS Q55:\n\n``` java\n/* 109 */       /*** CONSUME: Filter

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThe existing implementation of pivot translates into a single aggregation with one aggregate per distinct pivot value. When the number of distinct pivot values is large (say 1000+) this can get extremely slow since each input value gets evaluated on every aggregate even though it only affects the value of one of them.\n\nI'm proposing an alternate strategy for when there are 10+ (somewhat arbitrary threshold) distinct pivot values. We do two phases of aggregation. In the first we group by the grouping columns plus the pivot column and perform the specified aggregations (one or sometimes more). In the second aggregation we group by the grouping columns and use the new (non public) PivotFirst aggregate that rearranges the outputs of the first aggregation into an array indexed by the pivot value. Finally we do a project to extract the array entries into the appropriate output column.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdditional unit tests in DataFramePivotSuite and manual larger scale

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nMade these MLReadable and MLWritable: DecisionTreeClassifier, DecisionTreeClassificationModel, DecisionTreeRegressor, DecisionTreeRegressionModel\n- The shared implementation is in treeModels.scala\n- I use case classes to create a DataFrame to save, and I use the Dataset API to parse loaded files.\n\nOther changes:\n- Made CategoricalSplit.numCategories public (to use in persistence)\n- Fixed a bug in DefaultReadWriteTest.testEstimatorAndModelReadWrite, where it did not call the checkModelData function passed as an argument.  This caused an error in LDASuite, which I fixed.\n### How was this patch tested?\n\nPersistence is tested via unit tests.  For each algorithm, there are 2 non-trivial trees (depth 2).  One is built with continuous features, and one with categorical; this ensures that both types of splits are tested.\n","created_at":"2016-03-08T18:38:01Z","updated_at":"2016-03-16T21:22:54Z","closed_at":"2016-03-16T21:20:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6fbaa966f4c9c9d2a879de2afc9b31b30608e4d1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11581/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11581/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11581/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/cfb770ba4da92de63e9f4a64517c4d9d17de7d02","head":{"label":"jkbradley:dt-io","ref":"dt-io","sha":"cfb770ba4da92de63e9f4a64517c4d9d17de7d02","user":{"login":"jkbradley","id":5084283,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwODQyODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5084283?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley","html_url":"https://github.com/jkbradley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19877817,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTg3NzgxNw==","name":"spark","full_name":"jkbradley/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jkbradley","id":5084283,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwODQyODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5084283?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley","html_url":"https://github.com/jkbradley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jkbradley/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR add SQL generation support for aggregate with multi-distinct, by simply moving the `DistinctAggregationRewriter` rule to optimizer.\n\nMore discussions are needed as this breaks an import contract: analyzed plan should be able to run without optimization.  However, the `ComputeCurrentTime` rule has kind of broken it already, and I think maybe we should add a new phase for this kind of rules, because strictly speaking they don't belong to analysis and is coupled with the physical plan implementation. \n## How was this patch tested?\n\nexisting

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-13742\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\n`RandomSampler.sample` currently accepts iterator as input and output another iterator. This makes it inappropriate to use in wholestage codegen of `Sampler` operator #11517. This change is to add non-iterator interface to `RandomSampler`.\n\nThis change adds a new method `def sample(): Int` to the trait `RandomSampler`. As we don't need to know the actual values of the sampling items, so this new method takes no arguments.\n\nThis method will decide whether to sample the next item or not. It returns how many times the next item will be sampled.\n\nFor `BernoulliSampler` and `BernoulliCellSampler`, the returned sampling times can only be 0 or 1. It simply means whether to sample the next item or not.\n\nFor `PoissonSampler`, the returned value can be more than 1, meaning the next item will be sampled multiple times.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nTests are added into

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nReplacing \"\" (not null) with string \"EMPTY_STRING\" in StringIndexer. Another approach is to use \"0\" (or next available integer), but it may have performance issues when input column has integer values say (0 to 100000). We can use another string to replace \"\" values if \"EMPTY_STRING\" is commonly used.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nunit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis patch is ported over from @viirya's changes in #11048. Currently for most DDLs we just pass the query text directly to Hive. Instead, we should parse these commands ourselves and in the future (not part of this patch) use the `HiveCatalog` to process these DDLs. This is a pretext to merging `SQLContext` and `HiveContext`.\n\nNote: As of this patch we still pass the query text to Hive. The difference is that we now parse the commands ourselves so in the future we can just use our own catalog.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nJenkins, new `DDLCommandSuite`, which comprises of about 40% of the changes

to #11509, that simply refactors the interface that we use when resolving a pluggable `DataSource`.\n- Multiple functions share the same set of arguments so we make this a case class, called `DataSource`.  Actual resolution is now done by calling a function on this class.\n- Instead of having multiple methods named `apply` (some of which do writing some of which do reading) we now explicitly have `resolveRelation()` and `write(mode, df)`.\n- Get rid of `Array[String]` since this is an internal API and was forcing us to awkwardly call `toArray` in a bunch of places.\n","created_at":"2016-03-08T02:22:45Z","updated_at":"2016-03-08T23:21:07Z","closed_at":"2016-03-08T23:21:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"417eb619efe250219028c538d03fcf2da9b18f01","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11572/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11572/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11572/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d7472eafed5dcef0ad5c506cda5e4731c55fa6cf","head":{"label":"marmbrus:dataSourceResolution","ref":"dataSourceResolution","sha":"d7472eafed5dcef0ad5c506cda5e4731c55fa6cf","user":{"login":"marmbrus","id":527,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/527?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus","html_url":"https://github.com/marmbrus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17230869,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzMDg2OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"marmbrus/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"marmbrus","id":527,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/527?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus","html_url":"https://github.com/marmbrus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/marmbrus/spark","description":"Mirror

createDataFrame(sqlContext, iris)\n\n## Render a histogram for the Sepal_Length column \nhistogram(irisDF, \"Sepal_Length\", nbins=12)\n\n```\n\n![histogram](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13985649/13588486/e1e751c6-e484-11e5-85db-2fc2115c4bb2.png)\n\nNote: Usage will change once SPARK-9325 is figured out so that histogram() only takes a Column as a parameter, as opposed to a DataFrame and a name\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAll unit tests pass.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR is to convert SQL from analyzed logical plans containing Generate operator.\n\nSample Plan :\n\n```\nGlobalLimit 3\n+- LocalLimit 3\n   +- Project [gencol2#204]\n      +- Generate explode(gencol1#203), true, false, Some(gentab2), [gencol2#204]\n         +- Generate explode(array(array(1, 2, 3))), true, false, Some(gentab1), [gencol1#203]\n            +- MetastoreRelation default, t4, None\n```\n\nGenerated Query:\n\n```\nSELECT `gentab2`.`gencol2` FROM `default`.`t4` LATERAL VIEW explode(array(array(1, 2, 3))) `gentab1` AS `gencol1` LATERAL VIEW explode(`gentab1`.`gencol1`) `gentab2` AS `gencol2` LIMIT 3\n```\n- Generators can be specified in either projection list or in the lateral view clause.\n- First case is handled in projectToSQL\n- The second case is handled in generateToSQL\n- Also contains the fix for spark-13698.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThe current ANTLR3 parser is quite complex to maintain and suffers from code blow-ups. This PR introduces a new parser that is based on ANTLR4.\n\nThis parser is based on the [Presto's SQL parser](https://github.com/facebook/presto/blob/master/presto-parser/src/main/antlr4/com/facebook/presto/sql/parser/SqlBase.g4). The current implementation can parse and create Catalyst and SQL plans. Large parts of the HiveQl DDL and some of the DML functionality is currently missing, the plan is to add this in follow-up PRs.\n\nThis PR is a work in progress, and work needs to be done in the following area's:\n- [x] Error handling should be improved.\n- [x] Documentation should be improved.\n- [x] Multi-Insert needs to be tested.\n- [ ] Naming and package locations.\n### How was this patch tested?\n\nCatalyst and SQL unit tests.\n","created_at":"2016-03-07T09:40:41Z","updated_at":"2016-08-05T11:17:36Z","closed_at":"2016-03-28T19:33:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"afb5611bb21b77fba8984c3cb3c6751498d627a8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11557/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11557/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11557/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6f1c535162397f01acf0405bdc80b8c4c141fc64","head":{"label":"hvanhovell:ngParser","ref":"ngParser","sha":"6f1c535162397f01acf0405bdc80b8c4c141fc64","user":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35900688,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTkwMDY4OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"hvanhovell/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nAdd SQL generation support for window functions. The idea is simple, just treat `Window` operator like `Project`, i.e. add subquery to its child when necessary, generate a `SELECT ... FROM ...` SQL string, implement `sql` method for window related expressions, e.g. `WindowSpecDefinition`, `WindowFrame`, etc.\n\nThis PR also fixed SPARK-13720 by improving the process of adding extra `SubqueryAlias`(the `RecoverScopingInfo` rule). Before this PR, we update the qualifiers in project list while adding the subquery. However, this is incomplete as we need to update qualifiers in all ancestors that refer attributes here. In this PR, we split `RecoverScopingInfo` into 2 rules: `AddSubQuery` and `UpdateQualifier`. `AddSubQuery` only add subquery if necessary, and `UpdateQualifier` will re-propagate and update qualifiers bottom up.\n\nIdeally we should put the bug fix part in an individual PR, but this bug also blocks the window stuff, so I put them together here.\n\nMany thanks to @gatorsmile for the initial discussion and test cases!\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nnew tests in `LogicalPlanToSQLSuite`\n","created_at":"2016-03-07T07:08:43Z","updated_at":"2016-03-11T05:24:15Z","closed_at":"2016-03-11T05:24:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"04487530d1d8056d677e7ce5df9102ed6a8c6214","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11555/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11555/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11555/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/dab7a2f1a5cc0438405b0fa1cf532ab883bed7e7","head":{"label":"cloud-fan:window","ref":"window","sha":"dab7a2f1a5cc0438405b0fa1cf532ab883bed7e7","user":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19689699,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTY4OTY5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"cloud-fan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIn the Jenkins pull request builder, PySpark tests take around [962 seconds ](https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/SparkPullRequestBuilder/52530/console) of end-to-end time to run, despite the fact that we run four Python test suites in parallel. According to the log, the basic reason is that the long running test starts at the end due to FIFO queue. We first try to reduce the test time by just starting some long running tests first with simple priority queue.\n\n```\n========================================================================\nRunning PySpark tests\n========================================================================\n...\nFinished

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR adds the support to specify custom date format for `DateType` and `TimestampType`.\n\nFor `TimestampType`, this uses the given format to infer schema and also to convert the values\nFor `DateType`, this uses the given format to convert the values.\nIf the `dateFormat` is not given, then it works with `DateTimeUtils.stringToTime()` for backwords compatibility.\nWhen it's given, then it uses `SimpleDateFormat` for parsing data.\n\nIn addition, `IntegerType`, `DoubleType` and `LongType` have a higher priority than `TimestampType` in type inference. This means even if the given format is `yyyy` or `yyyy.MM`, it will be inferred as `IntegerType` or `DoubleType`. Since it is type inference, I think it is okay to give such precedences.\n\nIn addition, I renamed `csv.CSVInferSchema` to `csv.InferSchema` as JSON datasource has `json.InferSchema`. Although they have the same names, I did this because I thought the parent package name can still differentiate each.  Accordingly, the suite name was also changed from `CSVInferSchemaSuite` to `InferSchemaSuite`.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nunit tests are used and `./dev/run_tests` for coding style tests.\n","created_at":"2016-03-07T01:19:45Z","updated_at":"2018-01-02T03:40:42Z","closed_at":"2016-04-30T05:54:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"17eee31683372e331c3018c129bfc363d3a78e1b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11550/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11550/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11550/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c1710d538157823ef035234faa0ee052f788b786","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-13667","ref":"SPARK-13667","sha":"c1710d538157823ef035234faa0ee052f788b786","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIn order to make `docs/examples` (and other related code) more simple/readable/user-friendly, this PR replaces existing codes like the followings by using `diamond` operator.\n\n```\n-    final ArrayList<Product2<Object, Object>> dataToWrite =\n-      new ArrayList<Product2<Object, Object>>();\n+    final ArrayList<Product2<Object, Object>> dataToWrite = new ArrayList<>();\n```\n\nJava 7 or higher supports **diamond** operator which replaces the type arguments required to invoke the constructor of a generic class with an empty set of type parameters (<>). Currently, Spark Java code use mixed usage of this. \n## How was this patch tested?\n\nManual. \nPass the existing tests.\n","created_at":"2016-03-05T23:57:47Z","updated_at":"2016-03-29T05:26:40Z","closed_at":"2016-03-09T10:33:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"69a94b5aa6b4ca4bb0e9b4d4b0f71bc17310a3e2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11541/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11541/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11541/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2e208439d7cf213c3a9f9389e1944769dffcf715","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-13702","ref":"SPARK-13702","sha":"2e208439d7cf213c3a9f9389e1944769dffcf715","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"076009b94985b586ffa78078cc03abb85e308f06","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

both the MemoryStore and DiskStore implement a common `BlockStore` API, but I feel that this API is inappropriate because it abstracts away important distinctions between the behavior of these two stores.\n\nFor instance, the disk store doesn't have a notion of storing deserialized objects, so it's confusing for it to expose object-based APIs like putIterator() and getValues() instead of only exposing binary APIs and pushing the responsibilities of serialization and deserialization to the client. Similarly, the DiskStore put() methods accepted a `StorageLevel` parameter even though the disk store can only store blocks in one form.\n\nAs part of a larger BlockManager interface cleanup, this patch remove the BlockStore interface and refines the MemoryStore and DiskStore interfaces to reflect more narrow sets of responsibilities for those components. Some of the benefits of this interface cleanup are reflected in simplifications to several unit tests to eliminate now-unnecessary mocking, significant simplification of the BlockManager's `getLocal()` and `doPut()` methods, and a narrower API between the MemoryStore and

a cached block is spilled to disk and read back in serialized form (i.e. as bytes), the current BlockManager implementation will attempt to re-insert the serialized block into the MemoryStore even if the block's storage level requests deserialized caching.\n\nThis behavior adds some complexity to the MemoryStore but I don't think it offers many performance benefits and I'd like to remove it in order to simplify a larger refactoring patch. Therefore, this patch changes the behavior so that disk store reads will only cache bytes in the memory store for blocks with serialized storage levels.\n\nThere are two places where we request serialized bytes from the BlockStore:\n1. getLocalBytes(), which is only called when reading local copies of TorrentBroadcast pieces. Broadcast pieces are always cached using a serialized storage level, so this won't lead to a mismatch in serialization forms if spilled bytes read from disk are cached as bytes in the memory store.\n2. the non-shuffle-block branch in getBlockData(), which is only called by the NettyBlockRpcServer when responding to requests to read remote blocks. Caching the serialized bytes in memory will only benefit us if those cached bytes are read before they're evicted and the likelihood of that happening seems low since the frequency of remote reads of non-broadcast cached blocks seems very low. Caching these bytes when they have a low probability of being read is bad if it risks the eviction of blocks which are cached in their expected serialized/deserialized forms, since those blocks seem more likely to be read in local computation.\n\nGiven the argument above, I think this change is unlikely to cause performance regressions.\n","created_at":"2016-03-05T04:57:29Z","updated_at":"2016-03-08T18:43:18Z","closed_at":"2016-03-08T18:42:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"36458a3167335203c2750746be62f65e5733389d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11533/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11533/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11533/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/57d0bcec3348e2178b16da2e17d853529a6dc6d9","head":{"label":"JoshRosen:remove-memorystore-level-mismatch","ref":"remove-memorystore-level-mismatch","sha":"57d0bcec3348e2178b16da2e17d853529a6dc6d9","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22238710,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIzODcxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"JoshRosen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIt's weird that expressions don't always have all the expressions in it. This PR marks `QueryPlan.expressions` final to forbid sub classes overriding it to exclude some expressions. Currently only `Generate` override it, we can use `producedAttributes` to fix the unresolved attribute problem for it.\n\nNote that this PR doesn't fix the problem in #11497 \n## How was this patch tested?\n\nexisting tests.\n","created_at":"2016-03-05T00:42:54Z","updated_at":"2016-03-07T18:34:27Z","closed_at":"2016-03-07T18:34:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f7e6864b1788dce83bcdf882a6628ed6252912b7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11532/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11532/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11532/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5aa533bf59fd8b1f1ff8bd0c13b2829a3710f66d","head":{"label":"cloud-fan:generate","ref":"generate","sha":"5aa533bf59fd8b1f1ff8bd0c13b2829a3710f66d","user":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19689699,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTY4OTY5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"cloud-fan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWhen we add more DDL parsing logic in the future, SparkQl will become very big. To keep it smaller, we'll introduce helper \"parser objects\", e.g. one to parse alter table commands. However, these parser objects will need to access some helper methods that exist in CatalystQl. The proposal is to move those methods to an isolated ParserUtils object.\n\nThis is based on @viirya's changes in #11048. It prefaces the bigger fix for SPARK-13139 to make the diff of that patch smaller.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nNo change in functionality, so just Jenkins.\n","created_at":"2016-03-04T22:40:22Z","updated_at":"2016-03-08T03:41:28Z","closed_at":"2016-03-08T02:03:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5cd4c429b5e68b5f0720a0bba4ceb29dbe739b5a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11529/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11529/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11529/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/fc3c1684ad8e24ab9b05f0f7e02659ea2e365ebd","head":{"label":"andrewor14:parser-utils","ref":"parser-utils","sha":"fc3c1684ad8e24ab9b05f0f7e02659ea2e365ebd","user":{"login":"andrewor14","id":2133137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzMxMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2133137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14","html_url":"https://github.com/andrewor14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17231517,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzMTUxNw==","name":"spark","full_name":"andrewor14/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"andrewor14","id":2133137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzMxMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2133137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14","html_url":"https://github.com/andrewor14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/andrewor14/spark","description":"Mirror
