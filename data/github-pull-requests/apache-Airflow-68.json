This happens when two dags are almost identical (same task ids, same schedules).\r\n\r\nF.e., in this case we have the same dag copied twice, but i changed the name of one of them. When we allow dags to run backfill, we will receive events from two dags, but the run_id for task events will be the same in both cases.\r\n```\r\nfrom airflow import DAG\r\nfrom airflow.operators.bash import BashOperator\r\nfrom airflow.utils.dates import days_ago\r\n\r\nwith DAG(\r\n    dag_id='test',\r\n    start_date=days_ago(2),\r\n    schedule_interval=\"@daily\",\r\n    catchup=True\r\n) as dag1:\r\n    task1 = BashOperator(\r\n        task_id='run',\r\n        bash_command=\"echo 'test'; \"\r\n    )\r\n\r\n\r\nwith DAG(\r\n    dag_id='test_1',\r\n    start_date=days_ago(2),\r\n    schedule_interval=\"@daily\",\r\n    catchup=True\r\n) as dag2:\r\n    task2 = BashOperator(\r\n        task_id='run',\r\n        bash_command=\"echo 'test'; \"\r\n    )\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo fix that, I added a dag_id to the function that generates run_id for the task.

PR upgrades to latest ruff, and removes the ISC001 warning that warns us against potential conflict between ruff and ruff-formatter when two strings in one line get concatenated.\r\n\r\nThis warning makes sense if you run both ruff and formatting at the same time, but in our case we are doing it in two separate steps - one step is to run ruff linting and the second step is to run formatting and running formatting already runs after linting is complete.\r\n\r\nThis warnign is pretty misleading as it distracts from real formatting issues you might have.\r\n\r\nThere is - unfortunately - no standard way to remove the warning so we have to do it a little \"around\" - rather than running the pre-commit directly from ruff website, we run our local pre-commit with few lines of Python code that runs ruff through shell and greps out the ISC001 warning. We also force color to make sure the output is still coloured.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

#36591 has been implemented, in cas of `--spellcheck-only` checks for parallel packages, it might be that some build errors remain in build errors output (depends on some race conditions while

`graphviz` dependency has been problematic as Airflow required dependency - especially for ARM-based installations. Graphviz packages require binary graphviz libraries - which is already a limitation, but they also require to install graphviz Python bindings to be build and installed. This does not work for older Linux installation but - more importantly - when you try to install Graphviz libraries for Python 3.8, 3.9 for ARM M1 MacBooks, the packages fail to install because Pythonn bindings compilation for M1 can only work for Python 3.10+.\r\n\r\nThere is not an easy solution for that except commenting out graphviz dependency from setup.py, when you want to install Airflow for Python 3.8, 3.9 for MacBook M1.\r\n\r\nHowever Graphviz is really used in two places:\r\n\r\n* when you want to render DAGs wia airflow CLI - either to an image or directly to terminal (for terminals/systems supporting imgcat)\r\n\r\n* when you want to rended ER diagram after you modified Airflow models\r\n\r\nThe latter is a development-only feature, the former is production feature, however it is a very niche one.\r\n\r\nThis PR turns rendering of the images in Airflow in optional feature (only working when graphviz python bindings are installed) and effectively turns graphviz into an optional extra (and removes it from requirements).\r\n\r\nThis is not a breaking chnage technically - the CLIs to reder the DAGs is still there and IF you already have graphviz installed, it will continue working as it did before. The only problem when it does not work is where you do not have graphviz installed it will raise an error and inform that you need it.\r\n\r\nGraphviz will remain to be installed for most users:\r\n\r\n* the Airflow Image will still contain graphviz library, because it is added there as extra\r\n* when previous version of Airflow has been installed already, then graphviz library is already installed there and Airflow will continue working as it did\r\n\r\nThe only change will be a new installation of new version of Airflow from the scratch, where graphviz wlll need to be specified as extra or installed separatley in order to enable DAG rendering option.\r\n\r\nTaking into account this behaviour (which only requires to install a graphviz package), this should not be considered as a breaking change.\r\n\r\nExtracted from: #36537\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

The proposal introduces SLAs that are measured and contained within the lifetime of a Dag Run, and within the lifetime of a Task Instance which cost significantly less for the Airflow Infrastructure to compute than the existing concept of SLAs. The proposed SLA callback functions will also accept the TI context as the argument, which is a parameter that is used by other callback types (on_success_callback, on_failure_callback, on_execute_callback) to honor a consistent interface.\r\n\r\n### Dag Updates\r\n#### Added \r\n        sla: timedelta | None = None\r\n        on_sla_miss_callback: None | DagStateChangeCallback | list[DagStateChangeCallback] = None\r\n\r\n#### Marked for Deprecation\r\n        sla_miss_callback: None | SLAMissCallback | list[SLAMissCallback] = None\r\n\r\n### Dag Run DB Updates\r\n#### Added \r\n        sla_missed = Column(Boolean, default=False)\r\n\r\n### DagCallbackRequest Updates (callback_data json payload)\r\n#### Added\r\n        sla_miss: bool | None = False\r\n        dagrun_state: DagRunState\r\n#### Removed\r\n        is_failure_callback: bool | None = True\r\n\r\n### Dag SLA Measurement Semantics \r\nSLA tracking logic is evaluated when the active Dag Run is checked for updates using DagRun.update_state which is executed in the main scheduling loop. Dag SLA is tracked for all run types except for DagRunType.BACKFILL_JOB if **sla** parameter is provided in the Dag definition. \r\n\r\nIf **sla_missed** attribute of the Dag Run is already set to True, the scheduler loop will skip the SLA check for that dag run. This condition ensures that the SLA miss callback is generated only once when a scheduler loop has detected that the dag run has just missed its SLA and has been made the corresponding Dag Run record update in the DB.\r\n\r\nSLA is measured against the time between the Dag Run start_date (time) and the current time. If SLA is less than the time between the current time and the Dag Run start_date, SLA has been missed for the active Dag Run. Using the start_date (instead of the scheduled start time according to the time table) allows us to keep a consistent measuring pattern across MANUAL and SCHEDULED run types, and keep the SLA evaluation logic simple for the initial version of this feature.\r\n\r\nSLA callback is indicated by the sla_miss boolean flag on DagCallbackRequest. The State of the DagRun corresponding to the DagCallbackRequest is propagated through the dagrun_state parameter, which is also used to deduce whether a on_success_callback or a on_failure_callback must be executed along with the request. It is now possible for a DagCallbackRequest to be issued without a finished DagRun State (SUCCESS or FAILED); it is upto dagrun.handle_callback function to parse the parameters and execute the appropriate callback related to the given DagRun State or sla_miss flag.\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nis_failure_callback is kept in DagCallbackRequest for backward compatibility, and is only used if dagrun_state parameter is not available on a given callback. This allows the Airflow instance to also be able to properly support DagCallbackRequests that were generated prior to the Airflow version upgrade, that have not yet been executed.\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-07T00:18:02Z","updated_at":"2024-12-04T00:16:45Z","closed_at":"2024-12-04T00:16:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"jedcunningham","id":66968678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2OTY4Njc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66968678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham","html_url":"https://github.com/jedcunningham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ephraimbuddy","id":4122866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjI4NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4122866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy","html_url":"https://github.com/ephraimbuddy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"bolkedebruin","id":4282712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4282712

as used in our static checks has slightly different heuristics\r\nwhen running on on individual files and whole packages. This sometimes\r\ncauses semi-random failures when different set of files is produced\r\nwhen pre-commits split the files between parallel processes.\r\n\r\nThe regular `mypy-*` pre-commits work by passing filenames to mypy\r\nchecks, and when `--all-files` flag is passed to mypy, this means\r\nthat 2700 files are passed. In this case pre-commit will split such\r\nlong list of files to several sequential muypy executions. This\r\nis not very good because depending on the list of files passed,\r\nmypy can split the list diferently and results will be different\r\nwhen just list of files changes - so mypy might start detecting\r\nproblems that were not present before.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces new `mypy` check that runs mypy for packages\r\nrather than individual files. We cannot run them for local\r\npre-commit runs, because in many cases, such package based\r\nmypy check will run for minutes when a single file changes,\r\ndue to cache invalidation rules - and we do not want to penalise\r\ncommits that are changing common airflow code (because such PRs\r\nwould invalidate a lot of mypy cache every time such common file\r\nchanges). So we still want to run file-based mypy for local\r\ncommits. But we do not want to pass 2700 files in CI, rather than\r\nthat on CI we want to run mypy checks \"per package\".\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new \"manual\" stage mypy pre-commit check that\r\nwill run \"package\" based mypy checks and adds selective check rules\r\nthat will decide properly when to run such tests and separate,\r\nmatrix-based CI job that will run such mypy checks - separately\r\nfor each of the packages: \"airflow\", \"providers\", \"docs\", \"dev\".\r\n\r\nAlso this job will skip providers checks in non-main branch and\r\nwill run all tests when \"full tests needed\" are requested.\r\n\r\nThis PR ignores some errors resulted from 3rd-party libraries used\r\nthat are randomply appearing when some files are modified (and fixes\r\nthe current main failures)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

auto-detects if it should upgrade itself - based on finding Airflow directory it is in and calculating the hash of the pyproject.toml it uses. Finding the airflow sources to act on was using setup.cfg from Airflow and checking the package name inside, but since we are about to remove setup.cfg, and move all project configuration to pyproject.toml (see #36537), this mechanism will stop working.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes it by just checking if `airflow` subdir is present, and contains `__init__.py` with \"airflow\" inside. That should be \"good enough\" and fast, and also it should be backwards compatible in case new Breeze is used in older airflow sources.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

I was digesting for the question about \"why do you use airflow and not Github Actions\" I was looking for alternatives of making a DAG in a Github Action workflow. I ended up finding the list https://github.com/topics/dag and realized that Airflow was not listed... seems we are so far very conservative about the labels we use in Github.\r\n\r\nI was a bit surprised that a couple of similar projects used the label \"airflow\" to attract people even not building on airflow (apache/dolphinscheduler, argoproj/argo-workflows, orchest/orchest) :-D\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a few more labels to the Github repo in order to show-up in more overviews and lists to have more visibility - similar tools play better here.\r\n\r\nOverview of labels used by

be disabled on all pods if dag persistence is enabled, **except** scheduler (because scheduler pod is the sync point of dags).\r\n\r\nThis is alternative implementation of #30896, and second try of

was an edge case where parallel spell-check only could have failed because of interaction between packages that were built in parallel.\r\n\r\nOur documentation building is parallelized so that packages can be built in parallel, however there is an extra complexity added when different packages are built together in parallel and when those packages are referring to each other.\r\n\r\nThe problem is when one package is using reference to another package that is built at the same time. In this case the first package will fail, because it will miss references to the other package.\r\n\r\nThis problem has been solved for documentation building, by introducing multiple passess. If a package fails during the first wave, it is attempted to be rebuilt for the second time (without rebuilding the packages that succeeded) - this way at the second pass, there is no risk that those two pckages will be built in parallel.\r\n\r\nIn fact we have up to 3(!) passes - in order to account for situation where there are three packages in chain built together. I.e if there is A->B->C dependency chain and A and B are built when C is being built both A and B will fail in the first pass, but when A and B will be built in the second pass, A will also fail (because it will expect B) so we have a third pass (and there only A will be rebuilt).\r\n\r\nThis works fine for docs building, but when we do spellcheck-only, the situation is a bit different because we do not perform documentation build in the first place - so re-running spellchecking when we have some A-> B or A->B-C dependency, because neither B nor C will be rebuilt when we run spellcheck-only.\r\n\r\nThis was attempted to be fixed in #36336 by switching to docs+spellcheck build when we detect that spellchecking fails because of dependency to another package. However the fix was not good enough - what the fix did was to attempt to rebuild all packages and continue rebuilding all packages in 2nd and 3rd pass - which had the unfortunate side-effect that if the 2nd pass failed as well, the 3rd pass cleaned everything and repeated what the 2nd pass did before.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes it properly:\r\n\r\n* In case first pass with spellcheck-only fails because of package dependency, the 2nd pass will rebuild all originally built packages both build + spellcheck\r\n\r\n* However in this case the 3rd pass will only rebuild packages that failed in the 2nd pass (not all originally built packages as it was implemented in #36336)\r\n\r\n* Also in case we do spellcheck-only, we introduce the 4th(!) pass to account for the same case A->B-C that the third pass addresses in the \"build docs\" case\r\n\r\nThis PR adds typing, reviews return values from the methods implementing the logic and adds diagnostic logs and comments explaining the logic in an attempt to make it more readable and see what's going on.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

query runs periodically (controlled by `orphaned_tasks_check_interval` setting).\r\n\r\nWe observed that it can take around a minute to run for very large TI tables.  While looking into that issue, I noticed this query was more complicated than it needed to be.  This PR simplifies the query, though it may not meaningfully help performance.\r\n\r\nTwo changes here.\r\n\r\nFirst, previously we ended up with two joins to DagRun because the dag_run relationship attr is `lazy=\"joined\"` and sqlalchemy was not using it.  By setting to be lazy, we eliminate the extra join and we also don't ask for any columns in dag run (previously the generated query asked for all of them, even though we try to limit via options further down).\r\n\r\nSecond, we use inner join for queued by job.  It seems that the outer join was there when this adoption logic was first added in https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/10729, and the comment added at the time indicated that it was only there to handle tasks in flight during upgrade to 2.0:\r\n\r\n>                        # outerjoin is because we didn't use to have queued_by_job\r\n>                        # set, so we need to pick up anything pre upgrade. This (and the\r\n>                        # \"or queued_by_job_id IS NONE\") can go as soon as scheduler HA is\r\n>                        # released.\r\n\r\n### Before:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT\r\n

#34995 \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Overview:\r\nThe current implementation in Airflow allows file transfer from SFTP to GCS by first downloading the file to the worker's local storage, then uploading it to GCS. This approach can lead to low disk space issues when dealing with large files. This PR introduces a direct streaming method from SFTP to GCS, mitigating disk space concerns.\r\n\r\n### Key Changes:\r\nThis PR offers two options for streaming files from SFTP to GCS:\r\n\r\n- High Memory (Over 100MB): It is recommended to use Google's upload_from_file method, which is more robust and includes a retry feature. This method is preferable when sufficient memory is available.\r\n- Low Memory: Lower the stream_chunk_size and employ the custom method for streaming. This approach transfers smaller chunks of data, which is advantageous for systems with limited memory.\r\n\r\nFor logging transfer progress:\r\n\r\n- With Option 1, a custom source_stream_wrapper can be implemented to track the progress.\r\n- With Option 2, in addition to using a custom source_stream_wrapper, setting the log_interval enables built-in simple logging of transfer progress.\r\n\r\n### Significance:\r\nThese enhancements significantly improve the operator's capability in handling large files. They offer greater control over memory utilization and transfer progress logging, leading to more efficient resource management and monitoring in ETL pipelines.\r\n\r\n### Documentation:\r\nDocumentation updates are pending. I am currently seeking guidance on locating the source files for documentation to ensure all necessary updates are made.\r\n\r\n### Tests:\r\nA new test class with multiple tests has been added to cover the functionalities introduced in this PR. A setup function is included in the test class to avoid repetition of setup code across tests.\r\n\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nRead the **[Pull Request Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.rst#pull-request-guidelines)** for more information.\r\nIn case of fundamental code changes, an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvement+Proposals)) is needed.\r\nIn case of a new dependency, check compliance with the [ASF 3rd Party License

to #36343 and #36437.\r\n\r\nIn fab provider, the security manager inheritance check is wrong. We should check that the security manager provided by the user inherits from `FabAirflowSecurityManagerOverride` period. This change is also backward compatible with historical users of this feature because historically we were forcing the class defined in `SECURITY_MANAGER_CLASS` to inherit from [AirflowSecurityManager](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/www/security.py). And this class inherits from `FabAirflowSecurityManagerOverride`.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

PR changes Airflow installation and build backend to use new\r\nstandard Python ways of building Python applications.\r\n\r\nWe've been trying to do it for quite a while. Airflow tranditionally\r\nhas been using complex and convoluted build process based on\r\nsetuptools and (extremely) custom setup.py file. It survived\r\nmigration to Airflow 2.0 and splitting Airlfow monorepo into\r\nAirflow and Providers, adding pre-installed providers and switching\r\nproviders to use flit (and follow build standards).\r\n\r\nSo far tooling in Python ecosystme had not been able to fuflill our\r\nneeds and we refrained to develop our own tooling, but finally with\r\nappearance of Hatch (managed by Python Packaging Authority) and\r\nfew recent advancements there we are finally able to swtich to\r\nPython standard ways of managing project dependnecy configuration\r\nand project build setup (with a few customizations).\r\n\r\nThis PR makes airflow build process follow those standard PEPs:\r\n\r\n* Airflow has all build configuration stored in pyproject.toml\r\n  following PEP 518 which allows any fronted (`pip`, `poetry`,\r\n  `hatch`, `flit`, or whatever other frontend is used to\r\n  install required build dependendencies to install Airflow\r\n  locally and to build distribution pacakges (sdist/wheel)\r\n\r\n* Hatchling backend follows PEP 517 for standard source tree and build\r\n  backend implementation that allows to execute the build in a\r\n  frontend-independent way\r\n\r\n* We store all project metadata in pyprooject.toml - following\r\n  PEP 621 where all necessary project metadata components were\r\n  defined.\r\n\r\n* We plug-in into Hatchling \"editable build\" hooks following\r\n  PEP 660. Hatchling internally builds editable wheel that\r\n  is used as ephemeral step and communication between backend\r\n  and frontend (and this ephemeral wheel is used to make\r\n  editable installation of the projeect - suitable for fast\r\n  iteration of code without reinstalling the package.\r\n\r\nWith Airflow having many provider packages in single source tree\r\nwhere we want to be able to install and develop airflow and\r\nproviders together, this is not a small feat to implement the\r\ncase wher editable installation has to behave quite a bit\r\ndifferently when it comes to packaging and dependencies for\r\neditable install (when you want to edit sources directly) and\r\ninstallable package (where you want to have separate Airflow\r\npackage and provider packages). Fortunately the standardisation\r\nefforts in the Python Packaging community and tooling implementing\r\nit had finally made it possible.\r\n\r\nSome of the important ways bow this has been achieved:\r\n\r\n* We continue using provider.yaml in providers as the single source\r\n  of trutgh for per-provider dependencies. We added a possibility\r\n  to specify \"devel-dependencies\" in provider.yaml so that all\r\n  per-provider dependencies in `generated/provider_dependencies.json`\r\n  and `pyproject.toml` are generated from those dependencies via\r\n  update-providers-dependencies pre-commit.\r\n\r\n* Pyproject.toml is generally managed manually, but the part where\r\n  provider dependencies and bundle dependencies are used is\r\n  automatically updated by a pre-commit whenever provider\r\n  dependencies change. Those generated provider dependencies contain\r\n  just dependencies of providers - not the provider packages, but\r\n  in the final \"standard\" wheel file they are replaced with\r\n  \"apache-airflow-providers-PROVIDER\" dependencies - so that the\r\n  wheel package will only install the provider and use the\r\n  dependencies of that version of provider it installs.\r\n\r\n* We are utilising custom hatchiling build hooks (PEP 660 standard)\r\n  that allow to modify 'standard' wheel package on-the-fly when\r\n  the wheel is being prepared by adding preinstalled package\r\n  dependencies (which are not needed in editable build) and by\r\n  removing all devel extras (that are not needed in the PyPI\r\n  distributed wheel package). This allows to solve the conundrum\r\n  of having different \"editable\" and \"standard\" behaviour while\r\n  keeping the same project specification in pyproject.toml.\r\n\r\n* We added description of how `Hatch` can be employed as build\r\n  frontend in order to manage local virtualenv and install Airflow\r\n  in editable way easily - while keeping all properties of the\r\n  installed application (including working airflow cli and\r\n  package metadata discovery) as well as how to use PEP-standard\r\n  ways of bulding wheel and sdist packages.\r\n\r\n* We have a custom step (following PEP-standards) to inject\r\n  airflow-specific build steps - compiling www assets and\r\n  generating git commit hash version to display it in the UI\r\n\r\n* We also show how all this makes it possible to make it easy to\r\n  manage local virtualenvs and editable installations for Airflow\r\n  contributors - without vendor lock-in of the build tools as\r\n  by following standard PEPs Airflow can be locally and editably\r\n  installed by anyone using any build front-end tools following\r\n  the standards - whether you use `pip`, `poetry`, `Hatch`, `flit`\r\n  or any other frontent build tools, Airflow local installation\r\n  and package building will work the same way for all of them,\r\n  where both \"editable\" and \"standard\" package prepration is\r\n  managed by `hatchling` backend in the same way.\r\n\r\n* Previously our extras contained a \".\" which is not normalized\r\n  name for extras - `pip` and other tools replaced it automatically\r\n  with `_'. This change updates the extra names to contain\r\n  '-' rather than '.' in the name, following PEP-685.  This should be\r\n  fully backwards compatible, users will still be able to use \".\" but it\r\n  will be normalized to \"-\" in Airflow packages. This is also future\r\n  proof as it is expected that all package managers and tools\r\n  will eventually use PEP-685 applied to extras, even if currently\r\n  some of the tools (pip + setuptools) might generate warnings.\r\n\r\n* Additionally, this change organizes the documentation around\r\n  the extras and dependencies, explaining the reasoning behind\r\n  all the different extras we have.\r\n\r\n* As a bonus (and this is what we used to test it all) we are\r\n  documenting how to use Hatch frontend to:\r\n\r\n  * manage multiple Python installations\r\n  * manage multiple Pythob

PR changes Airflow installation and build backend to use new standard Python ways of building Python applications.\r\n\r\nWe've been trying to do it for quite a while. Airflow tranditionally has been using complex and convoluted build process based on setuptools and (extremely) custom setup.py file. It survived migration to Airflow 2.0 and splitting Airlfow monorepo into Airflow and Providers, adding pre-installed providers and switching providers to use flit (and follow build standards).\r\n\r\nSo far tooling in Python ecosystme had not been able to fuflill our needs and we refrained to develop our own tooling, but finally with appearance of Hatch (managed by Python Packaging Authority) and few recent advancements there we are finally able to swtich to Python standard ways of managing project dependnecy configuration and project build setup (with a few customizations).\r\n\r\nThis PR makes airflow build process follow those standard PEPs:\r\n\r\n* Airflow has all build configuration stored in pyproject.toml following PEP 518 which allows any fronted (`pip`, `poetry`, `hatch`, `flit`, or whatever other frontend is used to install required build dependendencies to install Airflow locally and to build distribution pacakges (sdist/wheel)\r\n\r\n* Hatchling backend follows PEP 517 for standard source tree and build backend implementation that allows to execute the build in a frontend-independent way\r\n\r\n* We store all project metadata in pyprooject.toml - following PEP 621 where all necessary project metadata components were defined.\r\n\r\n* We plug-in into Hatchling \"editable build\" hooks following PEP 660. Hatchling internally builds editable wheel that is used as ephemeral step and communication between backend and frontend (and this ephemeral wheel is used to make editable installation of the projeect - suitable for fast iteration of code without reinstalling the package.\r\n\r\nWith Airflow having many provider packages in single source tree where we want to be able to install and develop airflow and providers together, this is not a small feat to implement the case wher editable installation has to behave quite a bit differently when it comes to packaging and dependencies for editable install (when you want to edit sources directly) and installable package (where you want to have separate Airflow package and provider packages). Fortunately the standardisation efforts in the Python Packaging community and tooling implementing it had finally made it possible.\r\n\r\nSome of the important ways bow this has been achieved:\r\n\r\n* Pyproject.toml is generally managed manually, but the part where provider dependencies and bundle dependencies are used is automatically updated by a pre-commit whenever provider dependencies change.\r\n\r\n* We have dedicated (generated) `[devel_provider_*]` extras that are only installing provider dependencies in editable mode (not the final provider packages). This allows to install dependencies of providers individually or in groups in the editable installation of Airflow, without installing provider packages (i.e. we can use provider code directly from sources of editable Airflow installation).\r\n\r\n* We have some generated `[devel_*]` bundle extras that bundle together all or selected provider dependencies for installation in CI image and local editable virtualenv installation.\r\n\r\n* We are utilising custom hatchiling build hooks (PEP 660 standard) that allow to modify 'standard' wheel package on-the-fly when the wheel is being prepared by adding preinstalled package dependencies (which are not needed in editable build) and by removing all devel extras (that are not needed in the PyPI distributed wheel package). This allows to solve the conundrum of having different \"editable\" and \"standard\" behaviour while keeping the same project specification in pyproject.toml.\r\n\r\n* We added description of how `Hatch` can be employed as build frontend in order to manage local virtualenv and install Airflow in editable way easily - while keeping all properties of the installed application (including working airflow cli and package metadata discovery) as well as how to use PEP-standard ways of bulding wheel and sdist packages.\r\n\r\n* We have a custom step (following PEP-standards) to inject airflow-specific build steps - compiling www assets and generating git commit hash version to display it in the UI\r\n\r\n* We also show how all this makes it possible to make it easy to manage local virtualenvs and editable installations for Airflow contributors - without vendor lock-in of the build tools as by following standard PEPs Airflow can be locally and editably installed by anyone using any build front-end tools following the standards - whether you use `pip`, `poetry`, `Hatch`, `flit` or any other frontent build tools, Airflow local installation and package building will work the same way for all of them, where both \"editable\" and \"standard\" package prepration is managed by `hatchling` backend in the same way.\r\n\r\n* Previously our extras contained a \".\" which is not normalized name for extras - `pip` and other tools replaced it automatically with `_'. This change updates the extra names to contain '_' rather than '.' in the name. This should be fully backwards compatible, users will still be able to use \".\" but it will be normalized to \"_\" in Airflow packages.\r\n\r\n* Some of the problematic extras (graphviz, docgen) have been moved out of the core extras to optional ones. Particularly graphviz has been difficult to install on MacOS ARM. This is slightly backwards incompatible, but we should treat it as bugfix - the only missing feature Airflow will not be able to handle is to produce DAG output as image (and it only requires to install graphviz to bring it back). The difficulty of installing graphviz as required dependency justifies the slight backwards-incompatible change.\r\n\r\n* Additionally, this change organizes the documentation around the extras and dependencies, explaining the reasoning behind all the different extras we have.\r\n\r\n* As a bonus (and this is what we used to test it all) we are documenting how to use Hatch frontend to:\r\n\r\n  * manage multiple Python installations\r\n  * manage multiple Pythob virtualenv environments\r\n  * build Airflow packages for release management\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

For advanced user who know what they are doing, rather the API `HTTP PATCH /dags/{dag_id}/dagRuns/{dag_run_id}/taskInstances/{task_id}' is the right way.

when using `airflow dags test`, there is no easy way to know programmatically if a DagRun fails since the state is not stored in DB. The way to do know relies on log lines as below:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nstate=$(airflow dags test exception_dag | grep \"DagRun Finished\" | awk -F, '{for(i=1;i<=NF;i++) if ($i ~ / state=/) print $i}' | awk -F= '{print $2}') if [[ $state == \"failed\" ]]; then exit 1 else exit 0 fi\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR will return an exit code 1 when `airflow dags test` command if DagRun fails and makes it easy to integrate in CI for testing.","created_at":"2023-12-31T16:53:31Z","updated_at":"2024-01-02T10:40:17Z","closed_at":"2024-01-02T10:38:55Z","merged_at":"2024-01-02T10:38:55Z","merge_commit_sha":"383ad31c76411fb0a9f7d4243729d7bb0640ff0c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1672279581,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjcyMjc5NTgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:CLI","name":"area:CLI","color":"e99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2172803017,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcyODAzMDE3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:bug-fix","name":"type:bug-fix","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog:

is a follow-up and split form original PR #35868 and just removes all MSSQL support from Airflow Core (w/o breeze, migrations).\r\n\r\nAs discussed and voted in https://lists.apache.org/thread/pgcgmhf6560k8jbsmz8nlyoxosvltph2\r\n\r\nIt does NOT remove the provider package, so no misunderstanding: Apache Airflow further will \"work\" with MSSQL and the provider package and features are not touched. All Operators keep in place. Just the metadata support is reduced to sqlite (dev only), Postgres, MySQL.\r\nNote that for this also the build of MSSQL client code is kept inside the Docker as Provider packages rely on this

it comes to access and management plugins management follows different pattern than DAG files. While DAG files can (and should) be modified by DAG authors, the whole idea of Plugins was to make it only possible to modify plugins folder (and installl plugin-enabled packages) by the Deploymenet Managers, not DAG authors.\r\n\r\nThe difference is quite important because even in a simplest installation, airflow webserver never needs to access DAG files, while it should be able to access plugins.\r\n\r\nThis is even more profound in the environment (leading in the future to multi-tenant deployments) plugins are not 'per-tenant\" - they must be installed and managed by deployment manager, because those plugins can be used by Airflow Webservers.\r\n\r\nIn the future we might want to make distinction between these two different types of plugins, because theorethically it would be possible to distingquish \"scheduler, worker & triggerer\" plugins from the \"webserver\" plugins - however we do not have such disctinction today and whoever manages plugins folder is impacting both webserver and workers.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

used to have changelog in wheel package description but since those changelogs are immutable in the released packages, we removed the changelog from description some time ago and instead we publish link to the changelog as \"project URL\". However the changelog links are not available until we publish the packages, so there is no easy way to see the changelog - and the \"Status of providers\" is the easiest (and pretty convenient) way of looking at what changes are coming.\r\n\r\nThis PR removes mentioning that \"changelogs are available\" in the PyPI packages and explains that you should look for included PRs in the \"Status issue\" until the providers are released.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.
