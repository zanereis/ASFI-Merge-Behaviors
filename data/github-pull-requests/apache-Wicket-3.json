does implement IMetaDataBufferingWebResponse but fails to buffer header data. Headers are therefore lost in some cases. I took the provided test from WICKET-7107 and reduced it to the minimum required to demonstrate the issue. I also added the header buffering to BaseWicketTester#WicketTesterServletWebResponse. \r\nI believe that this is an improvement but it ultimately falls short of actually testing wicket core functionality. It only tests the test infrastructure. Also, WICKET-7107 is still valid. In the quick start, the buffered response sent after the redirect does not contain the CSP header.","created_at":"2024-04-25T14:07:20Z","updated_at":"2024-05-23T09:47:48Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7d2d847adc3137db005034588aed07fdf6cf6c12","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/pulls/846/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/pulls/846/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/issues/846/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/wicket/statuses/a2d559a80a1789de01698d9ba26dc55d96151ec8","head":{"label":"dr0ps:dr0ps/WICKET-7107","ref":"dr0ps/WICKET-7107","sha":"a2d559a80a1789de01698d9ba26dc55d96151ec8","user":{"login":"dr0ps","id":32899886,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyODk5ODg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32899886?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr0ps","html_url":"https://github.com/dr0ps","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr0ps/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr0ps/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr0ps/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr0ps/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr0ps/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr0ps/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr0ps/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr0ps/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr0ps/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":567812413,"node_id":"R_kgDOIdghPQ","name":"wicket","full_name":"dr0ps/wicket","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dr0ps","id":32899886,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyODk5ODg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32899886?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr0ps","html_url":"https://github.com/dr0ps","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr0ps/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr0ps/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr0ps/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr0ps/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr0ps/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr0ps/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr0ps/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr0ps/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr0ps/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dr0ps/wicket","description":"Apache

of the changes in <a href=\"https://github.com/google/error-prone/releases/tag/v2.26.0\">2.26.0</a>, plus a bug fix to the module name of the annotations artifact <code>com.google.errorprone.annotations</code> (<a

note:</strong></p>\n<p>Now that the annotations artifact explicit declares a module instead of relying on <code>Automatic-Module-Name</code>, JDK 17 and newer perform stricter module encapsulation checks. Modularized libraries depending on Error Prone annotations <code>2.26.x</code> and newer may see errors like:</p>\n<pre><code>error: package com.google.errorprone.annotations is not visible\nimport com.google.errorprone.annotations.CheckReturnValue;\n                            ^\n  (package com.google.errorprone.annotations is declared in module com.google.errorprone.annotations, but module ... does not read it)\n</code></pre>\n<p>The fix is to add <code>requires static</code> to the module declaration of modularized libraries that depend on Error Prone annotations:</p>\n<pre lang=\"diff\"><code> module your.module {\n...\n+  requires static com.google.errorprone.annotations;\n }\n</code></pre>\n<hr />\n<p>Full Changelog: <a href=\"https://github.com/google/error-prone/compare/v2.26.0...v2.26.1\">https://github.com/google/error-prone/compare/v2.26.0...v2.26.1</a></p>\n<h2>Error Prone 2.26.0</h2>\n<p><strong>Warning: This release contains a bug, please use <a href=\"https://github.com/google/error-prone/releases/tag/v2.26.1\">2.26.1</a> or newer instead.</strong></p>\n<p>Changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The 'annotations' artifact now includes a <code>module-info.java</code> for Java Platform Module System support, thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/sgammon\"><code>@‚Äãsgammon</code></a> in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/error-prone/issues/4311\">#4311</a>.</li>\n<li>Disabled checks passed to <code>-XepPatchChecks</code> are now ignored, instead of causing a crash.
