repeated analysis of distance metrics, discrepancies were observed. This appears to be caused by the YTEX package attempting to cache LCS's between CUIs, leading to inconsistent outputs when making repeated calls to the similarity service. By disabling the cache, each distance computation is forced to locate the LCS, ensuring consistent output even when calling multiple CUI pairs in succession.\r\n\r\nFrom my testing, the performance impact of disabling the cache is negligible. Until further investigation can determine why the cache is causing inconsistencies, it is advisable to keep it disabled.","created_at":"2024-02-15T13:57:22Z","updated_at":"2024-02-15T13:57:22Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ctakes/pulls/16/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ctakes/pulls/16/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ctakes/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ctakes/issues/16/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ctakes/statuses/7873e126c24b1d49b08731fcf9f6a67ce6404900","head":{"label":"jlpainter:ytex-caching-bugfix","ref":"ytex-caching-bugfix","sha":"7873e126c24b1d49b08731fcf9f6a67ce6404900","user":{"login":"jlpainter","id":10247389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjQ3Mzg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10247389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlpainter","html_url":"https://github.com/jlpainter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlpainter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlpainter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlpainter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlpainter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlpainter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlpainter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlpainter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlpainter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlpainter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":610499763,"node_id":"R_kgDOJGN8sw","name":"ctakes","full_name":"jlpainter/ctakes","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jlpainter","id":10247389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjQ3Mzg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10247389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlpainter","html_url":"https://github.com/jlpainter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlpainter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlpainter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlpainter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlpainter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlpainter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlpainter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlpainter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlpainter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlpainter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jlpainter/ctakes","description":"Apache

However, this requires that when testing against Perl's package, you must specify to use --instrinsic sanchez as the cTakes YTEX implementation of the IC is ONLY using the Sanchez implementation. If you do not specify the Resnik when calling the perl scripts, it will default to the corpus based IC which results in different numbers being produced. Once you force it to use the Sanchez IC, the distance metrics correspond exactly when running against the same UMLS database

patch makes the following code cleanup and mathematical corrections to the kernel metrics as well as the max-depth calculation for a concept graph:\r\n\r\nCorrect the construction of the initial concept graph whereby the dummy root node has a depth value of zero which was creating wildly unreasonable max-depths for individual graphs.\r\n\r\nIntrinsicLCHMetric contained a mathematical error where the formula misinterpreted that it should be -1 times the log and instead had an implementation that was 1 minus the log. In addition, the way the concept graph is computed, there is a dummy root node created which inflated the depth of the nodes by (2) - this is now corrected and the output matches exactly to values computed by the Perl UMLS::Similarity LCH computation\r\n\r\nLCHMetric contained a mathematical error where the formula misinterpreted that it should be -1 times the log and instead had an implementation that was 1 minus the log. The LCH metric also contained the same depth error as LCH intrinsic and this has been corrected.\r\n\r\nJaccardMetric could have had a divide by zero if the ic1 + ic2 was equal to the lcsIC. Added a check to insure this does not happen.\r\n\r\nThe LinMetric code has been cleaned up to be more readable\r\n\r\nWu-Palmer Metric also suffered from a mis-calculation of node depth due to the dummy node.

patch makes the following code cleanup and mathematical corrections to the kernel metrics:\r\n\r\n- IntrinsicLCHMetric contained a mathematical error where the formula misinterpreted that it should be -1 times the log and instead had an implementation that was 1 minus the log. In addition, the way the concept graph is computed, there is a dummy root node created which inflated the depth of the nodes by (2) - this is now corrected and the output matches exactly to values computed by the Perl UMLS::Similarity LCH computation\r\n- LCHMetric contained a mathematical error where the formula misinterpreted that it should be -1 times the log and instead had an implementation that was 1 minus the log. The LCH metric also contained the same depth error as LCH intrinsic and this has been corrected.\r\n- JaccardMetric could have had a divide by zero if the ic1 + ic2 was equal to the lcsIC. Added a check to insure this does not happen.\r\n- The LinMetric code has been cleaned up to be more readable\r\n- SokalMetric - added a parenthesis for clarity that the formula is evaluated properly\r\n- Wu-Palmer Metric also suffered from a mis-calculation of node depth due to the dummy node.  This code was also cleaned up to be more readable and to document exactly how the similarity score is computed.\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-22T23:34:06Z","updated_at":"2024-01-30T14:13:43Z","closed_at":"2024-01-30T14:09:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"65263196749eac3c3a3f98d25d52b4cef5c7883f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ctakes/pulls/11/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ctakes/pulls/11/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ctakes/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ctakes/issues/11/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ctakes/statuses/58e767b034f570e192959a12f7740814b146d7e2","head":{"label":"jlpainter:ctakes-ytex-metric-patches","ref":"ctakes-ytex-metric-patches","sha":"58e767b034f570e192959a12f7740814b146d7e2","user":{"login":"jlpainter","id":10247389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjQ3Mzg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10247389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlpainter","html_url":"https://github.com/jlpainter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlpainter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlpainter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlpainter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlpainter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlpainter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlpainter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlpainter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlpainter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlpainter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":610499763,"node_id":"R_kgDOJGN8sw","name":"ctakes","full_name":"jlpainter/ctakes","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jlpainter","id":10247389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjQ3Mzg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10247389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlpainter","html_url":"https://github.com/jlpainter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlpainter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlpainter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlpainter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlpainter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlpainter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlpainter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlpainter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlpainter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlpainter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jlpainter/ctakes","description":"Apache

pull requests makes the following changes:\r\n\r\n- Update the ctakes parent pom.xml to bump support to MySQL 8.0.33\r\n- Update the concept graph templates to reference SNOMEDCT as SNOMEDCT_US which is the current name in UMLS\r\n- Update the create_tables.sql to be compatible with MySQL 8.0.x SQL commands\r\n- Update the ytex.properties examples to reflect that we need an xmldb.url to specify when JDBC URLs containing an ampersand which must be escaped by the SAX parser when processing templates for conn.xml in the ant build process.\r\n\r\nFurther notes for testing:\r\n\r\nOnce this patch is applied, you can generate new concept graphs using a locally installed version of the UMLS database following the previous directions from the ctakes website.  Running the command \"ant -f build-setup.xml all\" will create the ytex database using a new version of the UMLS, but you should update the scripts/data/umls/MRCONSO.RRF and MRSTY.RRF with your current extract. These files are too large now to commit to github.  If you are going to build multiple sources into a single concept graph, insure that all sources are represented in the MRCONSO.RRF file for the umls_aui_fword generation steps which setup the ytex database prior to creating concept graphs.\r\n\r\nThe concept graph sct-rxnorm database by default as specified in the buildnon-asf.xml file. If you want to generate an alternate concept network, update the cg.name to match one of the templates provided (e.g. sct-umls will build ONLY the Snomed concept graph - you can specify any number of sources as long as they exist in your local UMLS database). See the main method in  o.a.ctakes.ytex.kernal.dao.ConceptDaoImpl.java for examples on how to generate a new concept graph from code.","created_at":"2024-01-22T23:14:52Z","updated_at":"2024-02-15T13:35:11Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ctakes/pulls/10/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ctakes/pulls/10/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ctakes/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ctakes/issues/10/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ctakes/statuses/ab14ff16362c1da5baf066c43538c16a98540fd6","head":{"label":"jlpainter:ctakes-ytex-mysql-update","ref":"ctakes-ytex-mysql-update","sha":"ab14ff16362c1da5baf066c43538c16a98540fd6","user":{"login":"jlpainter","id":10247389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjQ3Mzg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10247389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlpainter","html_url":"https://github.com/jlpainter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlpainter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlpainter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlpainter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlpainter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlpainter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlpainter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlpainter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlpainter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlpainter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":610499763,"node_id":"R_kgDOJGN8sw","name":"ctakes","full_name":"jlpainter/ctakes","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jlpainter","id":10247389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjQ3Mzg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10247389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlpainter","html_url":"https://github.com/jlpainter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlpainter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlpainter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlpainter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlpainter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlpainter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlpainter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlpainter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlpainter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlpainter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jlpainter/ctakes","description":"Apache

I've added the classgraph implementation for the pipercreator and removed the scanner.  ClassGraph will be much better at working with later versions of Java and modules (yuck)\r\n\r\nAlso added an -a option to the runPiperCreator script which optionally adds a new behavior:\r\n\r\nBy default, only implementations with PipeBitInfo annotations will be found. With a new system property \"ctakes.gui.all-impls\",  all implementations of the classes we used to scan (minus the ones you filtered ) will be found.   That list is de-duped before display  The difference with and without the -a option is about 40 pipebits.  \r\n\r\nThere was also a PipeFinder class that no one was using and since it depended on the scanner, I converted that to use ClassGraph too.  Also added a main() as a unit test for it and a new script  runPiperFinder() that just prints out all the piper files it finds in the fill class and resource paths and their
