changes:\n- VRs are single CPU, so Threading based implementation favoured than Forking based\n- Implements a Python based password server that does not use file based locks\n- Saving password mechanism is provided by using secure token only to VR (localhost)\n- Old serve_password implementation is removed\n- Runs with Python 2.6+ with no external dependencies\n- Locks used within threads for extra safety\n\nThe aim for this is to improve password server by relying on a threading based approach to minimize RAM usage and at the same time avoid using file based lock.

Schuberg Philis we wanted to use the VPN feature, but found it hard to make it work in a reliable way. When we dove into it, we found some bugs and problems that we solved along the way. Since this change, the VPN connections are created and destroyed as expected. Also, we tightened the iptable rules to make it more secure.\n\nThe patched ipsectunnel.sh script works fine in our tests on 4.4, 4.5 and 4.6. Possibly also on 4.3.x when the fix for CLOUDSTACK-5501 is merged.\n\nAlso, after rebooting a VPC the VPN connection reconnected as one would expect.\n\nWe tested this change by using the shell script below (based on CloudMonkey). The script will create a VPN connection between each VPN customer gateway it finds, like in a mesh network. \n\nRegards,\nRemi Bergsma / Funs Kessen\n# !/bin/bash\n\nvpncustgws=`cloudmonkey list
