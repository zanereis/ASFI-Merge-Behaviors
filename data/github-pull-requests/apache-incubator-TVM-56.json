PR intends to remove the exception handling of various `_extract_***` functions of `xgboost` model in autotvm. The reason is that with this extra layer of exception handling in autotvm, `PopenPool` won't be able to capture the exception during worker running and therefore `None` results with `Status.COMPLETE` could be returned. I didn't add a test bcoz I am not sure what is the best way to mock a `None` result out of `xgboost` of `autotvm`. Any directions would be appreciated!\r\n\r\n@junrushao1994 @tqchen @vinx13

feature enables passing a textural representation of a relay module to the tvmc command line.\r\n\r\nExample: `tvmc compile relay.txt --target c --runtime=crt --executor=aot --executor-aot-unpacked-api=1 --pass-config tir.disable_vectorize=1 -f mlf`\r\n\r\nCurrently it is not possible to supply parameters as it is mainly intended to be used for testing certain relay functions or operators. In the future (with minor changes to the tvmc frontend api) params could be passed via an additional i.e. `params.bin` file\r\n\r\nThis commit also adds minimal unit testing of the added

quantization for broadcast ops was supported in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/10718, but apparently an invalid `BroadcastAttrs` can be created, where the channel axis can be set to 1 even though the input shape is of rank 1. I've hit this error when working on the quantized BERT model with the latest `main`. The error can be reproduced by running the test (disabled on CI since it is slow) https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/c2488ac863a8d17ab6b95d67ff19227ed4b2fcbe/tests/python/unittest/test_meta_schedule_integration.py#L220\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a workaround for cases like that, but I have a feeling that something needs to be fixed on the FQ2I side, where those invalid axes are created.\r\n\r\n@sfvaroglu @AndrewZhaoLuo @mbrookhart @anwang2009

on @masahi's PR #10578, we are able to further simplify the logic and remove redundancy.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n- Remove `MetaScheduleContext`, which is not useful any more after Masa's new relay backend;\r\n- Consolidate logic around `ApplyHistoryBest`, and slightly improve the error message;\r\n- Separate `integration.py` into 3 files: `apply_history_best.py`, `extracted_task.py` and `relay_integration.py`;\r\n\r\nThese changes make future Relax integration easier - the only thing needed is to add `relax_integration.py` without having to worry about potential

switches the PyTorch we install use to CPU only.\r\nAs discussed in #10758 we see funny things when linking libtorch (which is in general linked to a different version of CUDA than TVM will use) into libtvm.\r\nThis also cleans up some of the cuda use in the frontend tests (so hopefully it can run on CPU only but will make use of the GPU if available locally). This is a bit of a tough call, it might make sense to remove all optional CUDA use with the thought that we want local tests to reproduce the CI as closely as possible, if you have comments, I'm all

each allocation allocates an entire page, so even a relatively small number of allocations can use very large amounts of VTCM.  This commit changes calls to `AllocVtcmWorkspace` of shape `[N,M]` from performing `N` allocations of size `M`, to 1 allocation of size `N*M`.  Since `N` is usually much smaller than a page, this reduces the total amount of memory required.\r\n\r\nThis is an intermediate step, where the long-term solution is to use static planning for VTCM allocations.  This returns the same `void**` type as the static planning eventually will, but avoids excess memory use in the meantime.","created_at":"2022-04-05T16:27:27Z","updated_at":"2022-04-06T16:00:34Z","closed_at":"2022-04-06T15:58:00Z","merged_at":"2022-04-06T15:58:00Z","merge_commit_sha":"591a0009c47f7361cffa977307073c758dfac4b3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":858780915,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTg3ODA5MTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20need%20review","name":"status:

is a temporary fix for python not handling this case `T.Buffer[(T.int64(xx), T.int64(xx)), \"float32\"]` well. For now, `TVMScriptPrinter` will not print `match_buffer` with syntax sugar if the `shape` argument is typed other than `int32`.\r\n\r\nRoot cause of this behavior is that we defined `T.Buffer` as `__getitem__(self, args)` in which `args` is a list of all arguments. But adding `T.int64` to the list will make Python think there is more than one positional arguments and raise a TypeError. TVMScript with such semantics could actually pass our parser check but not the type checker of Python, meaning only handwritten script with typed args in  `T.buffer` will raise this error.\r\n\r\n@MasterJH5574 @vinx13 @junrushao1994

there, this pr aims to make some workload schedulable with `reorder` primitive. We can find a nice description for similar workloads in ethosu's cascade scheduler work:  https://github.com/apache/tvm-rfcs/blob/main/rfcs/0037-arm-ethosu-cascading-scheduler.md. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/tvm-rfcs/raw/main/resources/cascading-diagram.png\r\n\r\nGenerally, if we have consecutive ops like conv and pooling, tiling the last one, and `compute_at` others under the outer loops, we then create cascade tiles simultaneously. The block binding for sub-blocks (except last) are not affine, since they have overlapped tile regions, due to non-trivial strides and window size.\r\n\r\nUnder current check, we can not `reorder` each sub-block's inner loops to perform subsequent optimizations, since a global affine binding is required. But note that if we fix outer loops, the block binding wrt inner loops generally keep affineness. The pr try to allow `reorder` in this situation. \r\n\r\nThe example script below builds two consecutive pooling op from `te` and schedule them with tir:\r\n```python\r\nfrom tvm import topi\r\nx = tvm.te.placeholder(shape=[1, 16, 112, 112], name=\"x\")\r\ny1 = topi.nn.pool2d(x, [3, 3], [1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0], pool_type=\"max\")\r\ny2 = topi.nn.pool2d(y1, [3, 3], [1, 1], [1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0], pool_type=\"max\")\r\nf = tvm.te.create_prim_func([x, y2])\r\ns = tvm.tir.schedule.Schedule(f)\r\nn, c, h, w, kh, kw = s.get_loops(s.get_block(\"tensor_1\"))\r\nho, hi = s.split(h, factors=[None, 4])\r\ns.compute_at(s.get_block(\"tensor\"), ho)\r\nv2, v3 = s.get_loops(s.get_block(\"tensor\"))[-2:]\r\ns.reorder(v2, v3)  # affine check failure!\r\n```

`StackMemoryManager` in the `crt` currently requires `g_aot_memory` (the AOT memory array) to be 16 byte aligned. If `g_aot_memory` is **not** 16 byte aligned, then `StackMemoryManager_Init` decreases `workspace_size` (the amount of memory we use) to resolve the issue:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/2b94a7e6b19d4bba0d5e17fc5190e3da701e31db/src/runtime/crt/memory/stack_allocator.c#L89-L91\r\n\r\nHowever, when the size of our AOT memory array (`WORKSPACE_SIZE`) is set, it is drawn from the MLF file to be the smallest possible value. This means that whenever `g_aot_memory` is not 16 byte aligned, the `StackMemoryManager` will decrease its size, which will cause inference to fail.\r\n\r\nThis occurs in the Arduino backend, and this PR adds code to force `g_aot_memory` to be 16 byte aligned (thus making sure `offset = 0` and solving the issue for Arduino). However, I believe this bug also effects Zephyr and Ethos. @mehrdadh added the following code to circumvent the issue for Zephyr, but I believe Ethos is vulnerable (I don't have a board, so I can't test myself)\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/2f937801de21757a409d9d193f43fe5c0ab5a202/tests/micro/zephyr/test_utils.py#L88-L98\r\n\r\nI'll make a follow-up PR to fix the issue more nicely for Zephyr and Ethos (and possibly other `crt` users), and to add a unit test. However, for now I'd love to get this merged ASAP so Arduino can avoid this cryptic bug. I've [attached an Arduino sketch](https://github.com/apache/tvm/files/8403683/project.zip) (as a `.zip`) where this bug occurs - to see it happen, compile it and upload it to a Nano 33 BLE. Note that the issue might not happen on other boards/platforms where the bug exists, as if `g_aot_memory` is already 16 byte aligned, inference will work despite the bug.\r\n","created_at":"2022-04-03T02:24:54Z","updated_at":"2022-04-04T01:33:35Z","closed_at":"2022-04-04T01:33:35Z","merged_at":"2022-04-04T01:33:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"fcdf4636d866fefbf3e2a55daa614565ce97203a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/10886/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/10886/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/10886/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/d6f088632d85cae167535040fc91d47d2def77ff","head":{"label":"guberti:fix-arduino-workspace-alignment","ref":"fix-arduino-workspace-alignment","sha":"d6f088632d85cae167535040fc91d47d2def77ff","user":{"login":"guberti","id":3069006,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNjkwMDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3069006?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti","html_url":"https://github.com/guberti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":371518634,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzE1MTg2MzQ=","name":"tvm","full_name":"guberti/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"guberti","id":3069006,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNjkwMDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3069006?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti","html_url":"https://github.com/guberti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/guberti/tvm","description":"Open

https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/10366 is merged, all the search configurations (`EvolutionarySearchConfig`, `ReplayFuncConfig`, `ReplayTraceConfig`) are updated with a new field `max_trials_global` to be consistent with AutoScheduler's gradient-based task scheduler, which allows users to control the total number of trials of a model, while the scheduler distribute them unevenly according to task importance. This PR fixes the test cases that are not updated with this change, which are left undetected previously because they are not run in the CI.\r\n\r\nFor example, when tuning BERT-base, we could set `max_trials_global` to `20000`, and the task scheduler will distribute trials to each task by preferring tasks with more potential performance growth:\r\n\r\n```\r\n ID |

never worked in TypeScript before, so it's possible I'm wrong, but the behavior of this timer script appears to be inconsistent with the earlier(?) code in tvm/src/runtime/rpc/rpc_module.cc#L387-388.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, what this code is *supposed* to be doing is scaling up the number of runs measured per trial if minRepeatMs hasn't been reached. The `max` condition seems to be intended to make sure that the number of replicates run on subsequent trials is no less than 1.618 times the previous attempt's trials -- presumably as a failsafe against somehow getting stuck in a very tight loop. The version of the code in web/src/runtime.ts wouldn't actually avoid that problem,

adds a demonstration of extracting, scheduling, and e2e-compiling relay subgraphs with multiple anchor ops. Since task extraction is not associated with TE scheduling anymore, extracting a subgraph with multiple anchor TE compute just works.\r\n\r\nThe test case manually creates a simple fused mod with two `relay.dense`. But in the future, an effort like https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/9628 should make it easier to construct multi-anchor subgraphs.\r\n\r\nThe extracted TensorIR block corresponding to two TE `dense`
