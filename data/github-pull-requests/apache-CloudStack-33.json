Description\r\nACS, with KVM, cannot migrate VM's volumes from a `SharedMountPoint` to a `NFS` storage pool properly; it will not copy the volumes's template to the destination storage pool (if needed), neither update the VM's XML properly.\r\n\r\nFrom a `SharedMountPoint` to a `NFS` storage pool, ACS used to interpret that it would use `localhost` as the host of the storage system; as it is a shared mount point configured in all cluster's host, as server name, but `NFS` retrieves its path from KVM, so it needs to keep the same behavior as `NFS` to `NFS`.\r\n\r\nThis PR intends to enable migration between NFS <> ISCSI (via sharedmountpoint) in KVM. \r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ]

Has This Been Tested?\r\nIt has been tested locally in a test lab.\r\n1. I created a VM;\r\n2. I configured 2 primary storages, 1 as NFS and 1 as SharedMountPoint;\r\n3. I tried to migrate VM (with `migrateVirtualMachineWithVolume`) from a SharedMountPoint to a NFS, but it threw a Exception due to incorrect path on VM's XML;\r\n\r\n-- After appling this patch the

Description\r\n\r\nPR #4698 was merged at the master (4.16) but it fixes an issue that is also relevant for current LTS versions.\r\n\r\nConsidering that the port is relatively straight-forward and it can benefit releases 4.14.2.0 and 4.15.1.0, this PR proposes back-porting PR #4698 into 4.14 and later forward it to 4.15.\r\n\r\nMore details at  #4698.\r\n\r\n> In the execution flow of the API migrateVirtualMachineWithVolume, there is a step that copies the volume's template to the target storage, if it is needed.\r\n> In some cases when the volume is a data type, it (the volume) does not

Description\r\n\r\nAs a cloud provider, we don't want our customers to see other templates.

Create three domain with their respective domain admin accounts.\r\n2. Register new template for each account like the following table.\r\n3. Follow the test cases.\r\n\r\nOwner | Templates\r\n-------|--------------\r\nAdmin | U20, SystemVM\r\nTest0  | U0\r\nTest1  | U1\r\nTest2  | U2\r\n\r\n#### Test case one.\r\n\r\n1. Set `share.public.templates` to false for every domain\r\n2. List templates in every account. You can't see any templates except the owneres templates.\r\n\r\n#### Test case two\r\n\r\n1. Set `share.public.templates` like the following table.\r\n2. List templates in `test0` account. You should see combination of the `U20, U0, U2` with different `templatefilter` but not `U1`\r\n\r\nOwner | share.public.templates\r\n-------|--------------\r\nAdmin | true\r\nTest0  | Doesn't matter\r\nTest1  | false\r\nTest2  | true\r\n\r\n#### Test case three\r\n\r\n1. Set `share.public.templates` like the test case two\r\n2. List templates in `test0` with template id. You should be ablet to see the `U20, U0, U2` but empty result if you use `U1` id.\r\n\r\n\r\nI wrote [this](https://gist.github.com/soreana/7c20dd1b5bca00cfdfee5018c13add6a) script to test this pr, you can find it in the following link. You need the `cmk` command and you should put `admin`, `test1`, and `test2` users info in the cmk configuration file. How to run this?\r\n\r\n- Put account names in accounts array defined at top of the script\r\n- ./listTemplates.sh will list all filter for all accounts\r\n- ./listTemplates.sh <account name> list all templates using all possible filters for <account name>\r\n- ./listTemplates.sh <template filter> list all templates for accounts in ('admin' 'test' 'test2') using <template filter>\r\n- ./listTemplates.sh <account name> <template filter> list all templates for <accounts name> using <template filter>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) document -->\r\n","created_at":"2021-03-09T10:02:13Z","updated_at":"2022-04-22T02:10:22Z","closed_at":"2022-04-22T02:10:21Z","merged_at":"2022-04-22T02:10:21Z","merge_commit_sha":"debfb455eaf8796cf71cf4d64984a56142ba7df8","assignee":{"login":"sureshanaparti","id":12028987,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDI4OTg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12028987?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti","html_url":"https://github.com/sureshanaparti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"sureshanaparti","id":12028987,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDI4OTg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12028987?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti","html_url":"https://github.com/sureshanaparti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":584073853,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODQwNzM4NTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:api","name":"component:api","color":"1DB401","default":false,"description":""},{"id":584074680,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODQwNzQ2ODA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/type:security","name":"type:security","color":"bfdadc","default":false,"description":""},{"id":904051781,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5MDQwNTE3ODE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/Python","name":"Python","color":"a9b50e","default":false,"description":"Warning...

Description\r\nAddresses: https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/issues/4470 \r\nThis PR fixes the issue noticed while deleting a template in a zone and also adds cleanup, in order to remove such templates left behind.  The following is currently observed currently:\r\nIn a Zone with only 1 store:\r\n- when a template (private/public) is deleted, the template is marked as Inactive, but not removed\r\nIn a Zone with > 1 store:\r\n- when a private template is deleted, the template is marked as Inactive, but not removed. For eg, after deletion, the following is observed:\r\n```\r\nMariaDB [cloud]> select id,type,name,uuid,format,public,size,state,created,removed from vm_template where id =204\\G\r\n*************************** 1. row ***************************\r\n     id: 204\r\n   type: USER\r\n   name: template-private-2storesZone\r\n   uuid: d899e386-fd23-4c8b-9834-9cac9cd6febe\r\n format: QCOW2\r\n public: 0\r\n   size: 52428800\r\n  state: Inactive\r\ncreated: 2021-03-04 06:09:22\r\nremoved: NULL\r\n1 row in set (0.00 sec)\r\n\r\nMariaDB [cloud]> select id,template_id,store_id,created,state,size,store_role,install_path from template_store_ref where template_id =204\\G\r\n*************************** 1. row ***************************\r\n          id: 18\r\n template_id: 204\r\n    store_id: 1\r\n     created: 2021-03-04 06:09:22\r\n       state: Destroyed\r\n        size: 52428800\r\n  store_role: Image\r\ninstall_path: template/tmpl/2/204/1ba40914-9eba-33de-93b0-8c05ea6fc753.qcow2\r\n1 row in set (0.01 sec)\r\n```\r\n- When a public template is deleted, the templates are set as destroyed on the secondary store (template_store_ref), but it continues to be marked as Active in the vm_template table.

`security_group.py` it is returned the bridge device as `brname:` instead of the expected `brname`.\r\n\r\nWe experienced this issue on CloudStack 4.13.1.0 with _Security Groups_ enabled for _Advanced Networking_. Additionally, KVM nodes are running on Ubuntu 18.04.\r\n\r\nPR #4303 (merged in 4.15) added support for Ubuntu 20.04 which turned out to fix `get_bridge_physdev(brname)`; however, we faced the very same issue with the previous CloudStack and Ubuntu versions.\r\n\r\nEven though we might not get a `4.13.2`, and CloudStack `4.14.1.0` has just been released, this PR proposes merging the fix into branch `4.13` and then get it forwarded into `4.14`. Thus, allowing users to have this fix referenced and also opening the possibility of addressing this in case of a potential `4.14.2.0`.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n\r\n<!--- ********************************************************************************* -->\r\n<!--- NOTE: AUTOMATATION USES THE DESCRIPTIONS TO SET LABELS AND PRODUCE DOCUMENTATION. -->\r\n<!--- PLEASE PUT AN 'X' in only **ONE** box -->\r\n<!--- ********************************************************************************* -->\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [X] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n<!-- Please describe in detail how you tested your changes. -->\r\n<!-- Include details of your testing environment, and the tests you ran to -->\r\n<!-- see how your change affects other areas of the code, etc. -->\r\n\r\nWe had manually changed the `security_group.py` script on our KVM nodes.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR for fix https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/issues/4726 \r\n\r\n1. https://github.com/apache/cloudstack-primate/issues/158\r\n   - [x] When opening a dialog, the first element should be active (with the cursor ready for typing). This avoids extra clicks.\r\n   - [x] Some dialogs do not have 'Cancel' buttons - for example 'Assign Instance to Another Account'. The 'x' icon on the top right corner is always an option but I think we should be consistent here.\r\n\r\n2. https://github.com/apache/cloudstack-primate/issues/462\r\n   - [x] Create zone form is not aligned in mobile view\r\n   - [x] Page size changer doesn't show up on mobile mode\r\n   - [x] Enter to submit a form\r\n   - [x] While listing domains, on full page reload, it goes back to the root domain\r\n   - [x] Account in user info card doesn't directly go to account but to the account listview\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed.

Description\r\nWhen ACS is deploying a VM, it defines a minimum memory|CPU to the VM based on a calculation through the overprovisioning (defined mem|cpu speed / overprovisioning factor); Therefore, it will define a range of memory|CPU, even if it does not use scalable (dynamic) service offerings. \r\n\r\nThis PR intends to externalize 2 cluster's configurations to allow operators to decide if they want the minimum memory|CPU to be different from the allocated value when the overprovisioning's configurations are different than `1`. \r\n\r\nWhen we set the overprovisioning factor, it means that we (as operators) are willing to allocate more virtual resources than the physical ones. This is interesting when the hypervisor has optimization techniques such as the KVM ones for optimizing the allocation of common blocks among running virtual machines (Kernel Samepage Merging - KSM). Therefore, we do not need to reduce the minimum amount of memory that the VM must receive when the overprovisioning is higher than one. This is important for public cloud environments, where such definition can be perceived by final users.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nIt has been tested locally in a test lab.\r\n\r\n1.

Description\r\nThis PR removes some unnecessary code and enhances a few log messages at IpAddressManagerImpl.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, method `com.cloud.network.NetworkModelImpl.areServicesEnabledInZone` does not use list `checkedProvider`; the respective list should either be removed or populated.\r\n\r\nI have chosen to add provider names at `checkedProvider`, instead of removing it; however, I would appreciate any opinion/suggestion.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR aims at restoring the previous level of leniency in listing templates on stores that have been marked as deleted / removed by updating the DB.\r\nWhile Cloudstack doesn't allow deleting stores that have resources on them, it may so happen that users may mimic a deletion of a store by merely updating the DB. Under such a case, listing of templates is hampered due to an NPE that is caused.

Description\r\n`ACS` has some APIs to manage `guest_os` and `guest_os_hypervisor` mapping entries; however, it is impracticable to use it due to the way we have been working.\r\n\r\nMost times we add data to these tables via `SQLs` with a hardcoded `id`. (See [schema-41200to41300.sql](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/0f3f2a09370a18301db28ec3d28efe746b6437c9/engine/schema/src/main/resources/META-INF/db/schema-41200to41300.sql)). Therefore, if an operator adds a new row to `guest_os` via the API, when he/she updates the version to any that insert a new row to `guest_os`, it might break the update due to duplicated id.\r\n\r\nAn `INSERT IGNORE` would avoid the breaking, but it would not insert the new row (if it contains different data/information/configuration); therefore, it does not seem like a good solution. Although it may not happen often, it could generate duplicated data (like display_name...). \r\n\r\nThis PR intends to add new data in `guest_os` and to suggest a new way to insert `guest_os` data via `SQL`, verifying if it already exists on the table (with `insert... select ... where not exists`). \r\n\r\nObs: we used a temporary table to avoid repeating the code.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nIt has been tested locally on a test lab.\r\n1.

Description\r\nIn the execution flow of the API `migrateVirtualMachineWithVolume`, there is a step that copies the volume's template to the target storage, if it is needed.   \r\nIn some cases when the volume is a `data` type, it (the volume) does not have a template; therefore, it is going to generate an NPE when it tries to get the template's ID (Long to long auto conversion).\r\n\r\nThis PR intends to validate if the volume being copied has a template, before trying to copy the template. \r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing

Description\r\nUse ACPI event to reboot VM on KVM, and Use 'forced' reboot option to stop and start the VM(s).\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses the following:\r\n\r\n- Replaces the legacy stop/start logic to reboot VM on KVM, with libvirt's native reboot operation that will use ACPI event based rebooting.\r\n- Introduces new 'forced' parameter in the rebootVirtualMachine API, which facilitates to stop and start the user VM.\r\n- Introduces new 'forced' parameter in rebootSystemVm API, to stop and start the system VM.\r\n- Introduces new 'forced' parameter in rebootRouter API, to force stop and start the Router.\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case

Description\r\nThese tests were changing the value of an attribute in a protected static object at runtime instead of mocking the object. We discovered this problem when working with the docker build containers in https://github.com/khos2ow/cloudstack-deb-builder/pull/20. They were breaking the tests when building in the docker container. \r\n\r\nThis PR intends to improve these tests to use actual mocks, instead of change the value at runtime with reflection, keeping the same behavior.\r\n\r\n\r\nObs: The [DEB Builder](https://github.com/khos2ow/cloudstack-deb-builder) uses version 4.13 to test the container's building for Java8 containers, and 4.15 for Java11 containers.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nThe tests were been ran and the packages were built locally.","created_at":"2021-02-08T16:53:30Z","updated_at":"2021-02-26T12:35:49Z","closed_at":"2021-02-25T23:28:12Z","merged_at":"2021-02-25T23:28:11Z","merge_commit_sha":"e1f3179446529da3683154c044b15f277d0d7eab","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"rohityadavcloud","id":95203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud","html_url":"https://github.com/rohityadavcloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/4668/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/4668/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/4668/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/30602c7d2d65389e50069418c903068cbb9f52db","head":{"label":"GutoVeronezi:adjust-tests-to-allow-builders-containers","ref":"adjust-tests-to-allow-builders-containers","sha":"30602c7d2d65389e50069418c903068cbb9f52db","user":{"login":"GutoVeronezi","id":38945620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4OTQ1NjIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38945620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi","html_url":"https://github.com/GutoVeronezi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":325596270,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjU1OTYyNzA=","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"GutoVeronezi/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"GutoVeronezi","id":38945620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4OTQ1NjIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38945620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi","html_url":"https://github.com/GutoVeronezi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/GutoVeronezi/cloudstack","description":"Apache
