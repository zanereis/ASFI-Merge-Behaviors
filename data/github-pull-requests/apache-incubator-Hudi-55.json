What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nFor a MOR table 'mor_simple' and its RO table 'mor_simple_ro' and RT table 'mor_simple_rt', if user drops 'mor_simple_ro' without purging. There might be issue. Reproduce like below:\r\n```\r\n1. Create table as below:\r\nCREATE TABLE mor_simple (\r\n  `id` INT,\r\n  `name` STRING,\r\n  `price` DOUBLE)\r\nUSING hudi\r\nlocation '/user/hive/warehous/mor_simple'\r\nOPTIONS(\r\n  'type' = 'mor',\r\n  'primaryKey' = 'id',\r\n  'hoodie.table.precombine.field' = 'id'\r\n); \r\n\r\n2. Trigger hive-sync by inserting values \r\n insert into mor_simple values (1, 'z3', 1)\r\n\r\n3. 'show tables' -- we will find mor_simple_rt and mor_simple_ro show up;\r\n\r\n4. 'drop table mor_simple_ro' and 'show tables' -- we will find mor_simple is dropped but mor_simple_ro can never be dropped.\r\n```\r\nThis PR refines DropHoodieTableCommand and takes more consideration

archiving deletion\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nSuppose a flink application crashes while archiving, it leaves some instant files that should be deleted.\r\nIf the commit

and then delete commit file.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis pull request is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\nWhen creating table like below with a 'comment' and check by \"show create table\", the comment is not shown\r\n```\r\ncreate table test(\r\n  id int,\r\n  name string,\r\n  price double,\r\n  ts long\r\n ) using hudi\r\n comment \"This is a simple hudi table\"\r\n tblproperties (\r\n   primaryKey = 'id',\r\n   preCombineField = 'ts'\r\n )\r\n```\r\nThe cause is as below:\r\n1. Current hudi & spark3 invokes ShowCreateTableExec when \"show create ...\"\r\n2. ShowCreateTableExec checks table property of 'comment' for result\r\n3. Spark HiveClientImpl hides property of 'comment', but set it to Catalog#comment when returning a CatalogTable (https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/hive/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/hive/client/HiveClientImpl.scala#L487)\r\n\r\nThis PR targets to fix and give a support.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n  - *Restore table property of 'comment' when HoodieCatalog#loadTable*\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n  - *Added a test*\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nIn current code, AlterHoodieTableDropPartitionCommand and TruncateHoodieTableCommand require all partition fields should be specified when droping / truncating partitions(s), otherwise complain with AnalyisException (HoodieSqlCommonUtils#normalizePartitionSpec).\r\n\r\nBut native Spark/Hive SQL have no such limitations – – partition matching is provided as a functionality helping user to manage partition(s) in an easy way. Say dropping partitions with a single SQL \"alter table test drop partition (year='2020')\", but rather to specify all the partitions from (year='2020', month='01', day='01') to (year='2020', month='12', day='31')\r\n\r\nThis PR propose to refine the partition matching logic when drop / truncate partition and remove the limitation mentioned above.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Refine HoodieSqlCommonUtils#normalizePartitionSpec -- Reuse Spark utilities for column verifying;\r\n  - HoodieSqlCommonUtils#getMatchingPartitions provides  as a utility for partition matching;\r\n  - Corresponding change in AlterHoodieTableDropPartitionCommand and TruncateHoodieTableCommand;\r\n  - Check 'encodePartitioning' should always be true in SqlKeyGenerator;\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n  - Added tests in TestAlterTableDropPartition and TestTruncateTable\r\n  - Added tests in TestHoodieSparkSqlWriter\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nIn current code, AlterHoodieTableDropPartitionCommand and TruncateHoodieTableCommand require all partition fields should be specified when droping / truncating partitions(s), otherwise complain with AnalyisException (HoodieSqlCommonUtils#normalizePartitionSpec).\r\n\r\nBut native Spark/Hive SQL have no such limitations – – partition matching is provided as a functionality helping user to manage partition(s) in an easy way. Say dropping partitions with a single SQL \"alter table test drop partition (year='2020')\", but rather to specify all the partitions from (year='2020', month='01', day='01') to (year='2020', month='12', day='31')\r\n\r\nThis PR propose to refine the partition matching logic when drop / truncate partition and remove the limitation mentioned above.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Refine HoodieSqlCommonUtils#normalizePartitionSpec -- Reuse Spark utilities for column verifying;\r\n  - HoodieSqlCommonUtils#getMatchingPartitions provides  as a utility for partition matching;\r\n  - Corresponding change in AlterHoodieTableDropPartitionCommand and TruncateHoodieTableCommand\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n  - Added tests in TestAlterTableDropPartition and TestTruncateTable\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is

purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nReplacing interactions w/ HoodieRecordPayload and raw Avro payload with HoodieRecord interface.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately given the nature of such refactoring, it's impossible to break it down into more granular pieces, since all of the components being touched here are tied together tight.\r\n\r\nAddresses\r\n\r\n[HUDI-3380](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-3380)\r\n[HUDI-3379](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-3379)\r\n[HUDI-3378](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-3378)\r\n[HUDI-3353](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-3353)\r\n[HUDI-3354](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-3354)\r\n[HUDI-3381](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-3381)\r\n[HUDI-3380](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-3380)\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n1. remove HoodieRecordPayload from generic T in writeClient, ActionExecutor, Strategy. TableMetaData still use HoodieRecordPayload\r\n2. Use inheritance structure with HoodieFileReader->HoodieAvroFileReader->... and HoodieFileWriter->HoodieAvroFileWriter->... . HoodieFileReader expose HoodieRecord api with Mapper. Mapper can transform avro data to HoodieRecord with payloadClassFQN, preCombineField... .\r\n3. Create HoodieAvroIndexedRecord to hold the IndexedRecord. This record avoids serialization compared with HoodieAvroRecord.\r\n4. Put combineAndUpdate and preCombine api into HoodieAvroRecord. And replace using HoodiePayload#combineAndUpdate/preCombine. Most of the changes are in HoodieWriteHanle's inheritance class and xxxHelper.\r\n5. Put rewrite API in HoodieAvroRecord. Other engine specified record needs to implement this.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nExisting tests can already be covered\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding

`PARTITIONPATH_FIELD_NAME` similarly in the various key generators\r\n    * in particular, it now accepts both not specifying the prop key and setting it as the empty string to denote a non-partitioned table\r\n- While here, also parse `RECORDKEY_FIELD_NAME` similarly, and allow leaving not specifying `RECORDKEY_FIELD_NAME` to mean the default.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nCurrently, HoodieMetricsCloudWatchConfig is part of hudi-aws module, while HoodieMetricConfig is part of hudi-client-common. The builder of HoodieMetricConfig uses HoodieMetricsCloudWatchConfig. When we want to use hudi write client in other engines (presto/trino), we need to include hudi-aws module because HoodieMetricsConfig initialization falls in that path. But, this bloats the presto/trino bundle, which we want to keep as light as possible.\r\n\r\nThis PR decouples the two. Let all metric configs be in client-common (e.g. prometheus and datadog configs are already there). This way we can exclude hudi-aws from the bundles.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *Modify AnnotationLocation checkstyle rule in checkstyle.xml*\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nWhen reading data from flink-hudi to external storage, the result is incorrect  because of concurrency issues：\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n  - Add fileId in class  MergeOnReadInputSplit ;\r\n  - modify inputSplits method in class IncrementalInputSplits;\r\n  - add keyBy fileId in class HoodieTableSource;\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [HUDI-4044] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen reading data from flink-hudi to external storage, the result is incorrect  because of concurrency issues：\r\n \r\nHere's the  case:\r\n \r\nThere is a split_monitor task that listens for changes on the TimeLine every N seconds; There are four split_reader tasks for processing changing data and sinking data to external storage:\r\n \r\n(1) First,split_monitor listens to Instance1 changes , and the corresponding fileId is log1. Split_monitor distributes the fileId information to split_reader task 1 in Rebanlance mode for processing.\r\n \r\n(2) then,split_monitor listens for Instance2 change . The corresponding fileId is log1 (assuming that the changed data have the same primary key ). The split_monitor task distributes fileId information to split_reader task 2 in Rebanlance mode for processing.\r\n \r\n(3) Split_reader task 1 and split_reader task 2 process the same primary key data, and their processing speeds are inconsistent. As a result, the sequence of data sink to external storage is inconsistent. The data modified earlier overwrites the data modified later, resulting in incorrect data.\r\n \r\n \r\nSolution:\r\nAfter the split_monitor task monitors the data changes, it distributes them to the split_reader task through the FileId Hash mode to ensure that the same FileId files are processed in the same split_reader task, thus solving this problem .\r\n

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\n`getDataSize` has non-trivial overhead in the current `ParquetWriter` impl, requiring traversal of already composed Column Groups in memory. Instead we can sample these calls to `getDataSize` to amortize its cost.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n - Sample memory checks of the currently written output size to avoid excessive block traversals\r\n - Extracted HoodieBaseParquetWriter encapsulating shared functionality b/w `ParquetWriter` impls\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n       \r\n - [ ] For large changes, please consider breaking it into sub-tasks under an umbrella

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nFix getCommitsSinceLastCleaning failed when async cleaning\r\n\r\nWhen async cleaning\r\n```\r\n000.commit\r\n001.commit.requested\r\n002.clean\r\n001.commit.inflight\r\n001.commit\r\n003.commit.requested\r\n004.clean\r\n```\r\n002 cleaning did not include 001 because it has not been completed,So when 004 cleaning , 001 should be included when we calculate the commit after 002.But because 001 < 002,Therefore, 001 is not included. `getCommitsSinceLastCleaning` returns 0.\r\nSo we need to save last completed commit timestamp (000.commit), The last completed commit timestamp is used to calculate how many commit have been completed since the last clean\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n  - Add `lastCompletedCommitTimestamp` in `HoodieCleanMetadata`  for `getCommitsSinceLastCleaning `\r\n  - Add support for async clean in some clean unit test cases\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis pull request is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis pull request is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n(or)\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end.*\r\n  - *Added HoodieClientWriteTest to verify the change.*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a job locally.*\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n       \r\n - [ ] For large changes, please consider breaking it into sub-tasks under an umbrella JIRA.\r\n","created_at":"2022-04-30T15:39:23Z","updated_at":"2022-09-13T13:54:57Z","closed_at":"2022-09-13T13:54:49Z","merged_at":"2022-09-13T13:54:48Z","merge_commit_sha":"03c49cae52b75cee17a58d70369ce3c261f44177","assignee":{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2719800718,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE5ODAwNzE4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/priority:critical","name":"priority:critical","color":"B60205","default":false,"description":"production

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nI have two partitions named p1 and p2.\r\nI only delete record in p1 and only update record in p2.\r\nRun flink offline compaction and it will throw NPE, because the log file in p1 only contains delete operation and hudi cannot get schema from it.\r\n\r\nIf a `.log` file only contain delete operation, we can't parse schema from this file. So it should scan another `.log` file to parse schema when the code runs in the moment.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *Modify AnnotationLocation checkstyle rule in checkstyle.xml*\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis pull request is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis pull request is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n(or)\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end.*\r\n  - *Added HoodieClientWriteTest to verify the change.*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a job locally.*\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n       \r\n - [ ] For large changes, please consider breaking it into sub-tasks under an umbrella

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nAdded support for initializing DeltaStreamer without a defined Spark Master. That will enable the usage of DeltaStreamer on environments such as AWS Glue or other serverless environments where the spark master is inherited and we do not have access to it.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n - Modify HoodieDeltaStreamer class in order to have an option to inherit Spark Master.\r\n - Modify UtilHelpers class to have an option to start the Spark Context without defined Master.\r\n - Modify HoodieMultiTableDeltaStreamer to have the same default Spark Master( although right now is not used).\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis pull request is a trivial rework.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [x] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [x] Commit message is descriptive

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\n- Adding few perf optimizations for bulk insert row writer. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Avoid using udf for key generator for SimpleKeyGen and NonPartitionedKeyGen. \r\n- Fixed NonPartitioned Key generator to directly fetch record key from row rather than involving GenericRecord.\r\n- Other minor fixes around using static values instead of looking up hashmap. \r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n- Fixed TestHoodieDatasetBulkInsertHelper tests to test the fixed functionality. Rest of the fixes are covered with existing tests. \r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nThis PR adds support of reading by flink when comprehensive schema evolution(RFC-33) enabled and there were some operations *add column*, *rename column*, *change type of column*, *drop column*.\r\nSupported mode: batch/cow/snapshot\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Added new option to enable comprehensive schema evolution in flink\r\n  - Key changes are made inside `CopyOnWriteInputFormat`. Now, during the opening, it calculates schema of file, if this schema differs from queried schema, it creates cast map. After reading file, type conversion is performed according to constructed map.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n  - Added unit test `TestCastMap` to verify that type conversion is correct\r\n  - Added integration test `ITTestReadWithSchemaEvo` to verify that table with added, renamed, casted, dropped columns is read as expected. This test uses `TestSpark3DDL` to prepare data, so it works only with `-P scala-2.12,spark3.2`, since `TestSpark3DDL` works only with it.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n       \r\n - [ ] For large changes, please consider breaking it into sub-tasks under an umbrella JIRA.\r\n","created_at":"2022-04-27T09:44:05Z","updated_at":"2022-06-10T04:58:24Z","closed_at":"2022-06-10T04:57:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e376a8fe9920f280650b0b03dbcf147fae0c3d0d","assignee":{"login":"danny0405","id":7644508,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NDQ1MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7644508?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405","html_url":"https://github.com/danny0405","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"danny0405","id":7644508,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NDQ1MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7644508?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405","html_url":"https://github.com/danny0405","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2284138194,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMjg0MTM4MTk0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/schema-and-data-types","name":"schema-and-data-types","color":"ceae46","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2719802999,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE5ODAyOTk5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/priority:major","name":"priority:major","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":"degraded

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nFor MOR, when no merging is performed there is no point in reading either primary-key or pre-combine-key values (unless query is referencing these). Avoiding reading these allows to potentially save substantial resources wasted for reading it out.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n - Injecting Spark Session extensions for `TestMORDataSource`\r\n - Fixed `createBaseFileReader` seq to only create base-file readers based on the table's base-file format\r\n - Extracted `MergeOnReadFileReaders`\r\n - Fixed MOR schema-pruning seq to prune only columns required for merging (and not ones required for incremental reads for ex)\r\n - Rebased `HoodieMergeOnReadRDD` to accept file readers as a tuple\r\n - Avoid unnecessary unsafe projection\r\n - Fixed required schema pruning in cases when columns required for merging are not requested by the query\r\n - Fixed `dataSchema` to only strip out partition columns in case when partition values are extracted from partition path\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n       \r\n - [ ] For large changes, please consider breaking it into sub-tasks under an umbrella JIRA.\r\n","created_at":"2022-04-26T02:06:06Z","updated_at":"2022-07-22T22:32:45Z","closed_at":"2022-07-22T22:32:45Z","merged_at":"2022-07-22T22:32:45Z","merge_commit_sha":"39f2a06c85d237c51c3bf2b1e2f6876e7eb65e06","assignee":{"login":"yihua","id":2497195,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTcxOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2497195?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua","html_url":"https://github.com/yihua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"yihua","id":2497195,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTcxOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2497195?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua","html_url":"https://github.com/yihua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yihua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2177611461,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTc3NjExNDYx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/performance","name":"performance","color":"a6fcaf","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2610270804,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjEwMjcwODA0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/priority:blocker","name":"priority:blocker","color":"78FA72","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2719821152,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE5ODIxMTUy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/spark","name":"spark","color":"D9974C","default":false,"description":"Issues

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nCurrently, all Hudi `Relation`s bear performance gap relative to Spark's `HadoopFsRelation` and the reason to that is `SchemaPruning` optimization rule (pruning nested schemas) that is unfortunately predicated on usage of `HadoopFsRelation`, meaning that it's not applied in cases when any other relation is used.\r\n\r\nThis change is porting this rule to Hudi relations (MOR, Incremental, etc) by the virtue of leveraging `HoodieSparkSessionExtensions` mechanism injecting modified version of the original `SchemaPruning` rule that is adopted to work w/ Hudi's custom relations.\r\n\r\nPending Items\r\n - [x] ~`ReadSchema` is represented incorrectly in the current Spark Plans~\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n - Added customOptimizerRules to HoodieAnalysis\r\n - Added NestedSchemaPrunning Spark's Optimizer rule\r\n - Handle Spark's Optimizer pruned data schema (to effectively prune nested schemas)\r\n - Enable HoodieClientTestHarness to inject `HoodieSparkSessionExtensions`\r\n - Injecting Spark Session extensions for `TestMORDataSource`, `TestCOWDataSource`\r\n - Disabled fallback to `HadoopFsRelation`\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or
