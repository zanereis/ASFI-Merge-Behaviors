easily: -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

easily: -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-04-25T03:18:01Z","updated_at":"2021-04-27T02:24:22Z","closed_at":"2021-04-27T02:24:22Z","merged_at":"2021-04-27T02:24:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"03ec45ea6e991772502cc86b4c4f1efc3c472dcd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7620/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7620/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7620/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/6249f6e0f18236f6d39bb9fa89006a32029477fb","head":{"label":"skyguard1:fix_field_util","ref":"fix_field_util","sha":"6249f6e0f18236f6d39bb9fa89006a32029477fb","user":{"login":"skyguard1","id":24522024,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTIyMDI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24522024?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1","html_url":"https://github.com/skyguard1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":274626224,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzQ2MjYyMjQ=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"skyguard1/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"skyguard1","id":24522024,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTIyMDI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24522024?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1","html_url":"https://github.com/skyguard1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/skyguard1/dubbo","description":"Apache

change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-04-24T15:05:51Z","updated_at":"2021-05-16T12:49:53Z","closed_at":"2021-05-16T12:49:53Z","merged_at":"2021-05-16T12:49:53Z","merge_commit_sha":"4e9bd572f1d12412d1d4fc7132827bda9cac83b6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7618/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7618/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7618/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/2d95af61bd088771b3f64a5dfe6d618110e26c53","head":{"label":"xiaoheng1:up-dev-issue#7614","ref":"up-dev-issue#7614","sha":"2d95af61bd088771b3f64a5dfe6d618110e26c53","user":{"login":"xiaoheng1","id":12539730,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTM5NzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12539730?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1","html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoheng1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":187745345,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODc3NDUzNDU=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"xiaoheng1/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xiaoheng1","id":12539730,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTM5NzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12539730?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1","html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoheng1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoheng1/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

[GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-04-24T14:17:54Z","updated_at":"2021-04-26T04:33:15Z","closed_at":"2021-04-26T04:33:15Z","merged_at":"2021-04-26T04:33:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"2057906d7b69dd5cdd6e4084580e604d4c6185e7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7617/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7617/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7617/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/3d2cf4ab5cdd8c44824e241954400b997a21dad3","head":{"label":"xiaoheng1:up-dev-issue#7616","ref":"up-dev-issue#7616","sha":"3d2cf4ab5cdd8c44824e241954400b997a21dad3","user":{"login":"xiaoheng1","id":12539730,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTM5NzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12539730?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1","html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoheng1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":187745345,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODc3NDUzNDU=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"xiaoheng1/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xiaoheng1","id":12539730,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTM5NzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12539730?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1","html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoheng1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoheng1/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-04-23T04:31:38Z","updated_at":"2024-11-28T06:54:46Z","closed_at":"2021-04-26T03:01:34Z","merged_at":"2021-04-26T03:01:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"36870a7eaba18e7e0f5db20a8010c669ba7cc449","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7607/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7607/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7607/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/957697ab79388ec90c21049e7d3907a00dae8843","head":{"label":"CrazyHZM:fix/default_configuration_is_invalid","ref":"fix/default_configuration_is_invalid","sha":"957697ab79388ec90c21049e7d3907a00dae8843","user":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":152715619,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTI3MTU2MTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"CrazyHZM/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM/dubbo","description":"Apache

[GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-04-22T03:35:17Z","updated_at":"2021-05-28T02:38:22Z","closed_at":"2021-05-28T01:20:16Z","merged_at":"2021-05-28T01:20:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"9915770b446858f0771b85afab4ace45bf7fe90c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7602/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7602/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7602/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/c1c6cf6f31eff1cb21d8da893e4e65e50aaac1b2","head":{"label":"CrazyHZM:fix/Ignore_non-dubbo_nacos_services","ref":"fix/Ignore_non-dubbo_nacos_services","sha":"c1c6cf6f31eff1cb21d8da893e4e65e50aaac1b2","user":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":152715619,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTI3MTU2MTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"CrazyHZM/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM/dubbo","description":"Apache

[GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-04-19T12:57:31Z","updated_at":"2021-05-17T13:55:48Z","closed_at":"2021-05-17T13:55:48Z","merged_at":"2021-05-17T13:55:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"d476c5dd1c28c0a48c17998be1945f812be40e6a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7591/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7591/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7591/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/3ca209d558b42c2920d0d817084d992be25db2b5","head":{"label":"xiaoheng1:up-dev-issue#7590","ref":"up-dev-issue#7590","sha":"3ca209d558b42c2920d0d817084d992be25db2b5","user":{"login":"xiaoheng1","id":12539730,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTM5NzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12539730?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1","html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoheng1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":187745345,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODc3NDUzNDU=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"xiaoheng1/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xiaoheng1","id":12539730,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTM5NzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12539730?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1","html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoheng1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoheng1/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

[GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-04-15T11:34:17Z","updated_at":"2021-04-21T11:54:51Z","closed_at":"2021-04-21T11:17:59Z","merged_at":"2021-04-21T11:17:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"f3dd2dbf41e35e9691eb274e8e419f2895c0676d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7567/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7567/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7567/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/63c7e1358ba4c43dc9c5ca5748b1af10406f49d3","head":{"label":"pinxiong:develop","ref":"develop","sha":"63c7e1358ba4c43dc9c5ca5748b1af10406f49d3","user":{"login":"pinxiong","id":7067417,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNjc0MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7067417?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong","html_url":"https://github.com/pinxiong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":349733065,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDk3MzMwNjU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"pinxiong/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"pinxiong","id":7067417,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNjc0MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7067417?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong","html_url":"https://github.com/pinxiong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/pinxiong/dubbo","description":"Apache

field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-04-15T11:09:46Z","updated_at":"2021-04-21T11:05:24Z","closed_at":"2021-04-21T11:05:24Z","merged_at":"2021-04-21T11:05:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"c0f09c9890db1c12c2b63f78c366d830e07f08c0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7565/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7565/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7565/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/8faeee7a5fca81a676f72403e0f62cb164ae44ec","head":{"label":"xiaoheng1:up-dev-issue#7564","ref":"up-dev-issue#7564","sha":"8faeee7a5fca81a676f72403e0f62cb164ae44ec","user":{"login":"xiaoheng1","id":12539730,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTM5NzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12539730?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1","html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoheng1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":187745345,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODc3NDUzNDU=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"xiaoheng1/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xiaoheng1","id":12539730,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTM5NzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12539730?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1","html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoheng1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoheng1/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-04-15T10:27:02Z","updated_at":"2021-06-10T16:33:24Z","closed_at":"2021-06-10T16:32:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"55698194fe579c682da84ac5546380fa5386a5c6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7563/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7563/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7563/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/427cdaee2090b6cdded63573f7bd2eac4f8898f5","head":{"label":"70-cloud-lab:210415-enable-dubbo.service.xxx-in-properties","ref":"210415-enable-dubbo.service.xxx-in-properties","sha":"427cdaee2090b6cdded63573f7bd2eac4f8898f5","user":{"login":"70-cloud-lab","id":61860043,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYxODYwMDQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61860043?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab","html_url":"https://github.com/70-cloud-lab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":345975894,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDU5NzU4OTQ=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"70-cloud-lab/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"70-cloud-lab","id":61860043,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYxODYwMDQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61860043?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab","html_url":"https://github.com/70-cloud-lab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/70-cloud-lab/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/70-cloud-lab/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n当提供者和消费者部署在一起时，dubbo:service上的async参数无法生效，服务调用只执行同步调用。\r\n\r\n从用户角度看，服务是同步调用/异步调用应该只与配置参数有关，而与部署方式无关。\r\n\r\nissue-demo: https://github.com/70-cloud-lab/dubbo-issues/tree/main/210413-injvm-async\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n在InjvmInvoker.doInvoke时，如果async=true，则使用CompletableFuture+AsyncRpcResult返回result。async=false则保持原有逻辑。\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nMake [NetUtilsTest#testGetIpByHost()](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/blob/master/dubbo-common/src/test/java/org/apache/dubbo/common/utils/NetUtilsTest.java) run successfully.\r\n\r\nsee #7552\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nupdate [NetUtilsTest#testGetIpByHost()](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/blob/master/dubbo-common/src/test/java/org/apache/dubbo/common/utils/NetUtilsTest.java) test case\r\n\r\n## Reason\r\nIn some companies, there are short domains to simplify the full domain. So, the OPS team will set some rules to convert the short domain to IP address. Sometimes, the short domains is a string without separating with dots.\r\n\r\nThere are some examples in my company below:\r\n\r\n+ run `ping dubbo`\r\n![ping dubbo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7067417/114812601-e54b0200-9de2-11eb-860c-cf7afb12c63d.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n+ run `ping assdfasdfasdfasd`\r\n![ping assdfasdfasdfasd](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7067417/114812442-98672b80-9de2-11eb-9817-885ed391158e.png)\r\n\r\n+ run `ping dubbo.local`\r\n![ping dubbo.local](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7067417/114812778-483c9900-9de3-11eb-860d-cad6dfeb602d.png)\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\nUpdate the domain and make sure the domain contains dot.\r\n\r\nAlso, we can see the domain `dubbo` has been updated to `dubbo.local` in the branch of [3.0](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/blob/3.0/dubbo-common/src/test/java/org/apache/dubbo/common/utils/NetUtilsTest.java)\r\n\r\nSo, we'd better update the domain  from `dubbo` to `dubbo.local`\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

time to fix all these checkstyles for you but I want to know about your opinions first.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

-->\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-04-14T04:18:44Z","updated_at":"2021-04-21T10:59:32Z","closed_at":"2021-04-21T10:59:32Z","merged_at":"2021-04-21T10:59:32Z","merge_commit_sha":"3b8b394e40f4a2b1cab4f0e842b30e54d4f34e0b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7546/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7546/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7546/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/f865870043cd599c0e7f731aea9e4821e68d795c","head":{"label":"haoyann:fix-logger","ref":"fix-logger","sha":"f865870043cd599c0e7f731aea9e4821e68d795c","user":{"login":"haoyann","id":43994656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTk0NjU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43994656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann","html_url":"https://github.com/haoyann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":340824984,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDA4MjQ5ODQ=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"haoyann/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"haoyann","id":43994656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTk0NjU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43994656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann","html_url":"https://github.com/haoyann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/haoyann/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThe reason for adding the `triple` protocol as a `dubbo-demo` is as follows:\r\n\r\n+ `triple` protocol released in `3.0-preview` version. There are not many people who know it, we can promote it through `dubbo-demo`\r\n+ There are 4 examples in `dubbo-demo`, they are good for `dubbo` protocol but not good for `triple` protocol\r\n+ We can make a good comparison between the `dubbo` protocol and `triple` protocol\r\n+ I know all of dubbo's samples are in the [dubbo-samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project. However, the purpose of this project is to let users know how to use it, not be good for developers to study. It is very inconvenient for people who like to read the source codes\r\n\r\nTherefore, I strongly recommend to add `triple` protocol into `dubbo-demo` module.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n1. add `dubbo-demo-triple` sub-module in `dubbo-demo` module\r\n2. update `.gitignore` file\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-04-13T06:57:59Z","updated_at":"2021-04-13T07:45:37Z","closed_at":"2021-04-13T07:45:36Z","merged_at":"2021-04-13T07:45:36Z","merge_commit_sha":"303a5aff45e38249c00603a3aebad1b04489f648","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7537/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7537/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7537/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/9d9d69201ff7e99843756d43f2320385ec7cc09f","head":{"label":"guohao:3.0","ref":"3.0","sha":"9d9d69201ff7e99843756d43f2320385ec7cc09f","user":{"login":"guohao","id":13098309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDk4MzA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13098309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao","html_url":"https://github.com/guohao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":343317923,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDMzMTc5MjM=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"guohao/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"guohao","id":13098309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDk4MzA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13098309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao","html_url":"https://github.com/guohao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/guohao/dubbo","description":"Apache

it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-04-12T04:53:11Z","updated_at":"2021-04-12T04:53:31Z","closed_at":"2021-04-12T04:53:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"be2008677d20ee1dd8273533bcb7d8698bcff2ac","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7535/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7535/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7535/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/e84b0f67853e297767e93f87bc39950ba119a72f","head":{"label":"jybjobs:master","ref":"master","sha":"e84b0f67853e297767e93f87bc39950ba119a72f","user":{"login":"jybjobs","id":15391009,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzkxMDA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15391009?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jybjobs","html_url":"https://github.com/jybjobs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jybjobs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jybjobs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jybjobs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jybjobs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jybjobs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jybjobs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jybjobs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jybjobs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jybjobs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":258756453,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNTg3NTY0NTM=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"jybjobs/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jybjobs","id":15391009,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzkxMDA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15391009?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jybjobs","html_url":"https://github.com/jybjobs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jybjobs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jybjobs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jybjobs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jybjobs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jybjobs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jybjobs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jybjobs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jybjobs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jybjobs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jybjobs/dubbo","description":"Apache

contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-04-09T09:36:05Z","updated_at":"2021-04-09T11:52:51Z","closed_at":"2021-04-09T11:52:51Z","merged_at":"2021-04-09T11:52:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"31563eafb746681ee75436e0c45e412b054fda0b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7526/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7526/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7526/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/043ffb64dc69fa6ee836853dc5758e0f053ebeb3","head":{"label":"guohao:3.0","ref":"3.0","sha":"043ffb64dc69fa6ee836853dc5758e0f053ebeb3","user":{"login":"guohao","id":13098309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDk4MzA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13098309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao","html_url":"https://github.com/guohao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":343317923,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDMzMTc5MjM=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"guohao/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"guohao","id":13098309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDk4MzA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13098309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao","html_url":"https://github.com/guohao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guohao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/guohao/dubbo","description":"Apache

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-04-09T05:58:11Z","updated_at":"2021-04-12T09:36:57Z","closed_at":"2021-04-12T09:36:57Z","merged_at":"2021-04-12T09:36:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"82ff056d0a0430dfe5c595d046a9ec92e52871e9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7523/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7523/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7523/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/5d78f6a5f5c4dbd5eef14d50e323892aabc657b1","head":{"label":"xiaoheng1:up-dev-issue#7518","ref":"up-dev-issue#7518","sha":"5d78f6a5f5c4dbd5eef14d50e323892aabc657b1","user":{"login":"xiaoheng1","id":12539730,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTM5NzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12539730?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1","html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoheng1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":187745345,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODc3NDUzNDU=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"xiaoheng1/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xiaoheng1","id":12539730,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTM5NzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12539730?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1","html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoheng1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoheng1/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).","created_at":"2021-04-08T10:01:42Z","updated_at":"2021-06-08T16:06:14Z","closed_at":"2021-06-08T16:06:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3696c89ea07a21430b8f70c65dc413d3b3a6cfeb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7522/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7522/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7522/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/a5f39d92ff071fd32959cc9c95302ff3fceb755e","head":{"label":"liudaolunboluo:master","ref":"master","sha":"a5f39d92ff071fd32959cc9c95302ff3fceb755e","user":{"login":"liudaolunboluo","id":23066403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDY2NDAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23066403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liudaolunboluo","html_url":"https://github.com/liudaolunboluo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liudaolunboluo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liudaolunboluo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liudaolunboluo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liudaolunboluo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liudaolunboluo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liudaolunboluo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liudaolunboluo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liudaolunboluo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liudaolunboluo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"d391a06290c4ef46acb651bb951415a4fc22980d","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

easily: -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-04-05T14:26:33Z","updated_at":"2021-04-06T04:04:40Z","closed_at":"2021-04-06T03:52:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"113bc1e64439f8927404f61854a38e4aa5e2a6fb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7508/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7508/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7508/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/ba18d7781607ca93068e35e60fe3ecce64d69ca5","head":{"label":"ruanwenjun:dev_wenjun_refacContain","ref":"dev_wenjun_refacContain","sha":"ba18d7781607ca93068e35e60fe3ecce64d69ca5","user":{"login":"ruanwenjun","id":22415594,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDE1NTk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22415594?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruanwenjun","html_url":"https://github.com/ruanwenjun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruanwenjun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruanwenjun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruanwenjun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruanwenjun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruanwenjun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruanwenjun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruanwenjun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruanwenjun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruanwenjun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":303657328,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMDM2NTczMjg=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"ruanwenjun/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ruanwenjun","id":22415594,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDE1NTk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22415594?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruanwenjun","html_url":"https://github.com/ruanwenjun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruanwenjun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruanwenjun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruanwenjun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruanwenjun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruanwenjun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruanwenjun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruanwenjun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruanwenjun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ruanwenjun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ruanwenjun/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nfix bug for export async ignore exception\r\n\r\nwhen I use wrong threadPool config that does't exist and use async export model ,such as dubbo-thread-pool as below code:\r\n\r\n>             \r\n            ProtocolConfig protocol = new ProtocolConfig();\r\n            protocol.setName(\"dubbo\");\r\n            protocol.setPort(12345);\r\n            protocol.setThreads(16);\r\n            protocol.setIothreads(2);\r\n            protocol.setKeepAlive(true);\r\n            //this is bad thread-pool\r\n            protocol.setThreadpool(\"dubbo-thread-pool\");\r\n            protocol.setAccepts(4);\r\n            protocolConfigList.add(protocol); \r\n\r\n> \r\n\r\n        DubboBootstrap dubboBootstrap = DubboBootstrap.getInstance();\r\n        dubboBootstrap.service(service);\r\n        dubboBootstrap.configCenter(configCenterConfig);\r\n        dubboBootstrap.registry(registryConfig);\r\n        //export by async !!!\r\n        dubboBootstrap.exportAsync();\r\n        dubboBootstrap.start();\r\n\r\nin this situation , export operation will run in executorRepository , it will be fail if export catch exception because the workThread in threadPool will be die if catch error !!!\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nfix bug for export async ignore exception\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-04-03T14:44:53Z","updated_at":"2021-04-09T08:33:17Z","closed_at":"2021-04-06T06:30:38Z","merged_at":"2021-04-06T06:30:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"04788e6e6c893045c4e47db6d302e09047d03c62","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/37","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/37","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/37/labels","id":6618745,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNjYxODc0NQ==","number":37,"title":"2.7.11","description":"","creator":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":8,"state":"closed","created_at":"2021-04-02T04:49:39Z","updated_at":"2021-05-06T17:14:20Z","due_on":"2021-05-08T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2021-05-06T17:14:20Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7507/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7507/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7507/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/b38c86f648dd697df11a2a6dd606ebb007a9bb7f","head":{"label":"weiyue888999:fix-export-async-ignore-exception","ref":"fix-export-async-ignore-exception","sha":"b38c86f648dd697df11a2a6dd606ebb007a9bb7f","user":{"login":"weiyue888999","id":36350800,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MzUwODAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36350800?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiyue888999","html_url":"https://github.com/weiyue888999","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiyue888999/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiyue888999/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiyue888999/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiyue888999/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiyue888999/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiyue888999/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiyue888999/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiyue888999/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weiyue888999/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"aa6d43df11e67f65ff55ee48ec018af641eaa798","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.

is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-04-03T03:17:30Z","updated_at":"2021-04-08T07:27:34Z","closed_at":"2021-04-08T07:27:33Z","merged_at":"2021-04-08T07:27:33Z","merge_commit_sha":"c60a8f000b130071882e46180f2e185b9bde64a9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7506/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7506/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7506/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/5256955f4bc2f2621b90d26217ac2932b7aae3f6","head":{"label":"xiaoheng1:up-dev-issue#7507","ref":"up-dev-issue#7507","sha":"5256955f4bc2f2621b90d26217ac2932b7aae3f6","user":{"login":"xiaoheng1","id":12539730,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTM5NzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12539730?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1","html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoheng1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":187745345,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODc3NDUzNDU=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"xiaoheng1/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xiaoheng1","id":12539730,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTM5NzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12539730?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1","html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoheng1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoheng1/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nfix incorrect handling of the URLBuilder caused the wrong URL to be generated\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n在appItemToUrls方法中，对services进行遍历的时候，因为复用同一个URLBuilder，没有使用深拷贝，导致所有的值都追加在了一起。\r\n\r\nserviceItemToUrls方法中，对apps遍历的时候，也是这个问题。不过因为是追加参数到url，所以后者会覆盖前者，这个并不影响功能，我只是在这个上面和appItemToUrls保持统一。\r\n\r\n##

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-04-02T03:01:42Z","updated_at":"2021-04-19T12:07:04Z","closed_at":"2021-04-03T07:02:31Z","merged_at":"2021-04-03T07:02:31Z","merge_commit_sha":"aa6d43df11e67f65ff55ee48ec018af641eaa798","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/37","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/37","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/37/labels","id":6618745,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNjYxODc0NQ==","number":37,"title":"2.7.11","description":"","creator":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":8,"state":"closed","created_at":"2021-04-02T04:49:39Z","updated_at":"2021-05-06T17:14:20Z","due_on":"2021-05-08T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2021-05-06T17:14:20Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7501/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7501/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7501/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/a098e156f2c6e465bb968097d027031adb679052","head":{"label":"BurningCN:fix_url_generated_error","ref":"fix_url_generated_error","sha":"a098e156f2c6e465bb968097d027031adb679052","user":{"login":"BurningCN","id":43363120,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMzYzMTIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43363120?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN","html_url":"https://github.com/BurningCN","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":317421885,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMTc0MjE4ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"BurningCN/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"BurningCN","id":43363120,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMzYzMTIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43363120?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN","html_url":"https://github.com/BurningCN","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/BurningCN/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nImprove reference bean register, make xml parsing and annotation processing register bean definition in a similar way, solving the problem of reference injection.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n**`@DubboReference` annotation and `<dubbo:reference />` xml elements:**\r\n1. The main processing logic of `@DubboReference` annotation:\r\n* First, scan all bean definitions, find the field and method annotated by `@DubboReference`, and register the reference bean definition;\r\n* Then, inject the reference bean to other beans by matching type and name;\r\n\r\n2. Support  using`@DubboReference` with `@Bean` in java-config class, and support `@Conditional` on ReferenceBean\r\nBy post processing `AnnotatedBeanDefinition` which created by java-config `@Configuration` class ,  parsing `@DubboReference` with `@Bean`  and set reference props to bean definition attribute.\r\n\r\n3. Improve reference bean props populating\r\n\r\n4. Through the reference key, if the attributes of `@DubboReference` annotation and the `<dubbo:reference />` xml bean  are the same, they share the same bean definition.\r\n\r\n5. The default value of `@DubboReference/@DubboService/@Method/@Argument` annotated int type is changed to -1, and the default value of String type is an empty string.\r\n   `@DubboReference` and `@DubboService` annotations add `scope` attribute, @Method annotation adds `parameters` attribute.\r\n\r\n**Others:**\r\n1. Upgrade Spring version to 5.x\r\n2. Upgrade dubbo-config-spring  unit tests to junit 5\r\n3. Add tests for issuse #6000 and #7003 , localcall and import xml\r\n   and https://github.com/apache/dubbo-spring-boot-project/issues/779\r\n\r\n**TODO:** \r\n1. fix dubbo-spring-boot unit tests\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-04-01T08:13:05Z","updated_at":"2021-05-06T02:06:23Z","closed_at":"2021-05-05T12:59:41Z","merged_at":"2021-05-05T12:59:41Z","merge_commit_sha":"b62832b21a0191bf28fa290707ad016029474838","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/37","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/37","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/37/labels","id":6618745,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNjYxODc0NQ==","number":37,"title":"2.7.11","description":"","creator":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":8,"state":"closed","created_at":"2021-04-02T04:49:39Z","updated_at":"2021-05-06T17:14:20Z","due_on":"2021-05-08T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2021-05-06T17:14:20Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7494/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7494/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7494/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/8da7eed563fcdefceaaadb493ce600f844334a0a","head":{"label":"zhongxiongzeng:master","ref":"master","sha":"8da7eed563fcdefceaaadb493ce600f844334a0a","user":{"login":"zhongxiongzeng","id":41657421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNjU3NDIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41657421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongxiongzeng","html_url":"https://github.com/zhongxiongzeng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongxiongzeng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongxiongzeng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongxiongzeng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongxiongzeng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongxiongzeng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongxiongzeng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongxiongzeng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongxiongzeng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongxiongzeng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"c3730308b48e0bb38fc5c83afdcb19fbb414a166","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-03-29T02:20:54Z","updated_at":"2021-04-01T03:31:07Z","closed_at":"2021-03-29T03:20:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5c86c4ff608da7fdfc9442b7aa5481f168d51525","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7467/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7467/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7467/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/e3e1fb1f431a4ee3d6196da983960c4c5862985e","head":{"label":"kevinw66:typo","ref":"typo","sha":"e3e1fb1f431a4ee3d6196da983960c4c5862985e","user":{"login":"kevinw66","id":31196226,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMTk2MjI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31196226?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinw66","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinw66","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinw66/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinw66/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinw66/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinw66/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinw66/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinw66/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinw66/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinw66/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinw66/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":324349848,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjQzNDk4NDg=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"kevinw66/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kevinw66","id":31196226,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMTk2MjI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31196226?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinw66","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinw66","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinw66/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinw66/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinw66/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinw66/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinw66/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinw66/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinw66/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinw66/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinw66/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kevinw66/dubbo","description":"Apache

Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nUpdate LRU to LRU-2\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nReduce cache pollution by filtering one access data with a history list. This strategy will not occupy too much extra memory because the history list only saves the keys.\r\n\r\nWhen the data accessed for the first time, add it to the history list. If the size of the history list reaches max capacity, eliminate the earliest data. When the data already exists in the history list, and be accessed for the second time, then it will be put into the real cache.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAlso need to update LRUCacheTest, CacheTest, and CacheFilterTest due to the two-time verification mechanism of LRU-2, and two calls need to be performed to put the cache into LRUCache, which shows as commit. \r\n\r\nThe performance

change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43363120/112745259-9ecf6800-8fd9-11eb-8cff-ee684cc8240b.png)\r\n","created_at":"2021-03-28T07:24:24Z","updated_at":"2021-05-27T03:31:14Z","closed_at":"2021-05-27T03:31:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"32e138fa3ef87339f314c86b43c997df9e9da2d1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7458/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7458/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7458/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/ec121470867c30a043ee72cf22f8b030f492d705","head":{"label":"BurningCN:fix_calculating_elapseTime_error","ref":"fix_calculating_elapseTime_error","sha":"ec121470867c30a043ee72cf22f8b030f492d705","user":{"login":"BurningCN","id":43363120,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMzYzMTIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43363120?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN","html_url":"https://github.com/BurningCN","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":317421885,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMTc0MjE4ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"BurningCN/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"BurningCN","id":43363120,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMzYzMTIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43363120?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN","html_url":"https://github.com/BurningCN","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurningCN/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/BurningCN/dubbo","description":"Apache
