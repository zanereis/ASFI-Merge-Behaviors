is left:\r\n- transaction support (in the future I suppose)\r\n- Is representing Mutation as Row ok? To discuss.\r\n- There is a lot of duplication code in struct -> row and row -> struct translation. I would be grateful for some advice how (if possible in this case) to deal with it.\r\n- SpannerWriteResult is replaced with PDone thus FailureMode must be FAIL_FAST\r\n- To read from spanner Schema is needed to be added to the configuration. Schema can be constructed from Struct while running the pipeline, but idk how to pass the RowCoder to the pipeline otherwise. And it's to discuss whether validation of schemas equality is needed.\r\n- I didn't generify Read and Write because there is ReadAll , Transaction etc and this way is much less complicated. ReadRows and WriteRows shouldn't be used outside cross-language transforms.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR has the Go SDK join Java and Python in having its coders tested against the standard_coder.yaml suite.\r\n\r\n* It adds representation markers for standard types that previously didn't have representation (such as iterables, rows, length prefixes, etc) in the graph/coder package.\r\n* It adds execution wrappers for encoding, decoding those values in the exec package.\r\n* It adds serialization support for these representations in the graphx package.\r\n* Adds hashing support for row coded values.\r\n\r\nTesting of the code here is largely through the newly introduced fromyaml test harness which reads standard_coder.yaml and helps it along a touch, in particular in how to interpret the yaml versions of expected structures, which don't map to go types exactly.\r\n\r\nWhile this PR plumbs in Timers and ParamWindowCoders, these coders are not implemented in the SDK at this time, and those tests are skipped.  At best, the implementation is vestigial, but leaving them wholely unimplemented caused certain difficulties with the standard yaml test.\r\nSimilarly, while Windows are now fully plumbed through the stack, this is largely for convenience when testing those codings vs the standard_coders.yaml file. \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

will throw a duplicate key error when write requests in the batch contains duplicate keys. \r\nAn optional deduplication mechanism is added to avoid this error, taking reference from the implementation in [the official Python SDK of DynamoDB](https://github.com/boto/boto3/blob/develop/boto3/dynamodb/table.py).\r\nChanges to the ver1 module (beam-sdks-java-io-amazon-web-services) has been tested on an actual DynamoDB table with writes with duplicate keys. The job throws duplicate error if overwriteByPKeys are not specified, but ran successfully if the table's partition and sort keys are provided, as expected. \r\nChanges have been ported to the ver2 module (beam-sdks-java-io-amazon-web-services2), but not tested on an actual dynamodb table. It passed local unit tests as did v1. \r\ntests are updated to include provision of overwriteByPKeys, but a dedicated test for duplicate keys has not been written, since the mock dynamodb does not seem to throw on duplicate keys anyhow. \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR implements a filesystem for Azure Blobstore.  It is mostly complete, with the exception of the following TODOs that I will resolve in a separate PR:\r\n\r\n1) Add more pipeline options to the filesystem, including adding more credential options to authenticate an azure blob service client.  These will be added in AzureOptions.java, BlobstoreOptions.java, and DefaultAzureClientBuilderFactory.java.  I also plan to write a file called AzureModule.java, similar to the AwsModule.java file in aws/options, to parse credentials passed as pipeline options.\r\n\r\n2) Create mocks for unit tests, to be used in AzureBlobStoreFileSystemTest.java.  The current tests in AzureBlobStoreFileSystemTest are integration tests, using an actual Azure client, that can be run by setting the AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING environment variable.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

To mitigate the limited parallelism introduced by an implicit grouping on keys, we allow the states/timers associated with each input key to be shardable.\r\n\r\nThis PR modifies the state and work caching in the Dataflow Java runner such that the states of different shards of keys are tracked separately, to prepare it for shardable GroupIntoBatches.\r\n\r\nSee more details in https://s.apache.org/sharded-group-into-batches.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR adds support for logical types in Python schemas, and adds the first logical type implementation there for `beam:logical_type:millis_instant:v1`. \r\n\r\nI chose `apache_beam.utils.timestamp.Timestamp` as the Python type mapping for millis_instant . Note that `Timestamp` is represented as microseconds since the epoch, so this is a lossy mapping, but there is precedent for this in Python's `WindowedValueCoder`: https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/699f872ea1ef3bdb1588a029fc6b1e3185e986a6/sdks/python/apache_beam/coders/coder_impl.py#L1236-L1240\r\n\r\nAlso in this PR:\r\n- some changes to the Java SDK implementation of Beam schemas to make its `FieldType.DATETIME` type behave exactly like `beam:logical_type:millis_instant:v1` when used in portabillity (afa939e). `DATETIME` will be deprecated and removed in favor of a Java implementation of millis_instant in the future (BEAM-7554).\r\n- Unit testing in schemas_test and row_coder_test.\r\n- Tests using Timestamp in the Python SqlTransform.\r\n- Test cases in standard_coders_test.yaml (the first logical type tested there).\r\n\r\nNote the Python implementation of LogicalTypes in this PR is limited to those that do not use an argument.\r\n\r\nR: @robertwb \r\nCC: @lostluck \r\n\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-10702\r\n\r\nLooks like the artifact service started with `--job_endpoint=embed` uses `FileSystems.open` to read the artifacts to be staged, which by default decompresses the artifacts if they are compressed. PIP packages are compressed as .tar.gz, so when the worker container retrieves the PIP packages to install, they see .tar.gz files whose contents is actually the underlying .tar file.\r\n\r\nI would appreciate guidance for where to add tests for this.\r\n* `artifact_service_test` uses an in-memory file reader fn that doesn't actually share the code being used in production. Should I change that?\r\n* `worker_handlers_test` does not exist - there's `fn_runner_test.py` in that directory but I'm not sure how to test the artifact staging codepath via there.\r\n* Do we have any ValidatesRunner tests at all with `job_endpoint=embed`? If not, how would I go about adding some?\r\n\r\nR: @robertwb @pabloem \r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

test & back porting the `StreamOperatorStateContext.internalTimerServiceManager` logic from upstream but ran into other issues including checkstyle errors w.r.t. missing `package-info.java` and test failures.\r\n\r\nIt worked with my forked upstream Flink build with `AbstractStreamOperator.timeServiceManager` reverted to `protected`.\r\n\r\n@mxm any

some adjustments to  JdbcIOTest.testFluentBackOffConfiguration to fix the flakes observed recently.\r\n\r\nThe problem seems to be because the initial `connection` is held open for 10s to induce deadlocks in the Beam pipeline, and sometimes the pipeline fails early enough that `connection` is still open when we get to assertRowCount. Note the exception is thrown by pipeline.run() so commitThread.join() is never called, leaving this possibility open.\r\n\r\nThis PR resolves that issue by using assertRaises on the specific line that we expect to raise an error, and removes the 10s delay. Instead uniformly committing the connection once the Pipeline has failed.\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master
