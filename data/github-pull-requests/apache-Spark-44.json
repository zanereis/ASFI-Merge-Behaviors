What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThere seems to be a regression from Spark 3.5 to 4.0 caused by https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-43838 / https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/41347 as the following code no longer succeed:\r\n```\r\nval df = Seq((1, 2)).toDF(\"a\", \"b\")\r\nval df2 = df.select(df(\"a\").as(\"aa\"), df(\"b\").as(\"bb\"))\r\nval df3 = df2.join(df, df2(\"bb\") === df(\"b\")).select(df2(\"aa\"), df(\"a\"))\r\ndf3.show()\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease note that if we dig deeper then it turns out that if we omit the extra project from `df` then the following is actually a bug that came in with the very first version of `DeduplicateRelations`, that deduplicated `MultiInstanceRelation`s only:\r\n```\r\nval schema = StructType.fromDDL(\"a int, b int\")\r\nval rows = Seq(Row(1, 2))\r\nval rdd = sparkContext.parallelize(rows)\r\nval df = spark.createDataFrame(rdd, schema)\r\nval df2 = df.select(df(\"a\").as(\"aa\"), df(\"b\").as(\"bb\"))\r\nval df3 = df2.join(df, df2(\"bb\") === df(\"b\")).select(df2(\"aa\"), df(\"a\"))\r\ndf3.show()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe root cause seems to be `DeduplicateRelations` as it changes `df(\"a\")` (`a#7`) comming from the right side when it runs on the join:\r\n```\r\n=== Applying Rule org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.analysis.DeduplicateRelations ===\r\n!'Join Inner, '`=`(bb#12, b#8)              'Join Inner, '`=`(bb#12, b#18)\r\n :- Project [a#7 AS aa#11, b#8 AS bb#12]    :- Project [a#7 AS aa#11, b#8 AS bb#12]\r\n :  +- Project [_1#2 AS a#7, _2#3 AS b#8]   :  +- Project [_1#2 AS a#7, _2#3 AS b#8]\r\n :     +- LocalRelation [_1#2, _2#3]        :     +- LocalRelation [_1#2, _2#3]\r\n!+- Project [_1#2 AS a#7, _2#3 AS b#8]      +- Project [_1#15 AS a#17, _2#16 AS b#18]\r\n!   +- LocalRelation [_1#2, _2#3]              +- LocalRelation [_1#15, _2#16]\r\n```\r\nand then when the `.select()` API adds a `Project` node containing `df(\"a\")` above the join, it can't be resolved.\r\n\r\nThis is because `DeduplicateRelations` always keeps the attributes of the first occurance of a node (`Project [_1#2 AS a#7, _2#3 AS b#8]` in this case) and creates new instances for other occurances. The rule doesn't (and can't) take into account if a top level attribute can actually come from a node or not.\r\nIf `spark.sql.analyzer.failAmbiguousSelfJoin` is enabled then the `DetectAmbiguousSelfJoin` catches the issue as\r\n```\r\nColumn a#7 are ambiguous. It's probably because you joined several Datasets together, and some of these Datasets are the same. This column points to one of the Datasets but Spark is unable to figure out which one. Please alias the Datasets with different names via Dataset.as before joining them, and specify the column using qualified name, e.g. df.as(\"a\").join(df.as(\"b\"), $\"a.id\" > $\"b.id\"). You can also set spark.sql.analyzer.failAmbiguousSelfJoin to false to disable this check.\r\n```\r\nIf it is not enabled then `a#7` can't be resolved error is thrown.\r\n\r\nTo solve the above regression this PR:\r\n- Assigns `LogicalPlan.PLAN_ID_TAG`s to logical plans of `Dataset`s that don't have any id yet. (Connect planner already does this.)\r\n- Changes resolved `AttributeReference`s to `UnresolvedAttribute`s in certain `Dataset` APIs if an attribute doesn't seem valid based on the output of the underlying logical plan. Also, the `UnresolvedAttribute`s get the necessary tags to get resolved by `ResolveReferences` rule (`ColumnResolutionHelper.tryResolveDataFrameColumns()` logic) later.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nI've added a new ExplainMode, SilentMode, which allows us to use EXPLAIN or .explainString without any output.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhile investigating unit test duration we found that org.apache.spark.sql.execution.QueryExecution.explainString () takes approximately 14% time. This method generates the string representation of the execution plan. The string is often used for logging purposes. This is also called for each AQE job so it can save prod execution time too. While SPARK-44485 does exist to help optimize the prod execution time, the main purpose of this PR is to save time during unit testing.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nA couple new unit tests + existing.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2024-03-16T00:09:34Z","updated_at":"2024-06-30T00:22:38Z","closed_at":"2024-06-30T00:22:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f3a10acb7419fe96e7c2c3ac8ca87a01bd3364cc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45542/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45542/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/45542/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f83a1485780386a1093f4f893885f00bdc50e3b7","head":{"label":"ForVic:vsunderl/explain_silent_mode","ref":"vsunderl/explain_silent_mode","sha":"f83a1485780386a1093f4f893885f00bdc50e3b7","user":{"login":"ForVic","id":64456855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NDU2ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64456855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForVic","html_url":"https://github.com/ForVic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForVic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForVic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForVic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForVic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForVic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForVic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForVic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForVic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForVic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":772804997,"node_id":"R_kgDOLhARhQ","name":"spark","full_name":"ForVic/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ForVic","id":64456855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NDU2ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64456855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForVic","html_url":"https://github.com/ForVic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForVic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForVic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForVic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForVic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForVic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForVic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForVic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForVic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForVic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ForVic/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nA common pattern when developing SQL queries is teh addition, removal and commenting out of expressiomns in the select list.\r\nMost commonly users format the select list with an expression per line and a trailing comma for each but the last expression.\r\n```\r\nSELECT c1,\r\n       c2,\r\n       c3\r\n FROM T;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you want to comment out or remove the last column it is easy to forget the trailing comma in the previous line:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT c1,\r\n       c2,\r\n --      c3\r\n FROM T;\r\n```\r\n\r\nA less common style to combat this is to use a leading comma:\r\n```\r\nSELECT c1\r\n     , c2\r\n     , c3\r\n FROM T;\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow removing a column is easy:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT c1\r\n     , c2\r\n--     , c3\r\n FROM T;\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever this notation is rare and generally disliked.\r\n\r\nSome other products, most notably duckDB and Snowflake have added tolerance for trailing blank to make the following succeed:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT c1,\r\n       c2,\r\n FROM T;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to do this for Spark.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIf you can't fight them, join them....\r\nIt's a popular feature. Eliminates a peprcut.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. Aside from statements working which failed before it requires us to make FROM a RESERVED keyword.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nNew tests\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write

By default, the calendar with local session time zone will be returned. H2 dialect has bad implementation of get/setTimestamp as it doesn't do calculations right if you pass the calendar, so for H2 the decision is to just override this method and return null calendar. This behaviour can be turned off by setting `USE_NULL_CALENDAR` config to true.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIt turns out that the users will see same 'string values' of timestamps as they are in remote data source only if JVM time zone and spark local session time zone are equal. If users change JVM time zone (which is possible) or spark local session time zone, then they are not going to see same results. Therefore, when calling getTimestamp and setTimestamp, calendar with spark local session time zone is passed. \r\nThis is true for some data sources, and therefore these dialects could override getDatabaseCalendar method. If the change is risky, it is advised to use feature flag in overridden method.\r\n\r\nAlso, in this PR the pushdown value of timestamps is fixed in the following way:\r\n+ Since both NTZ and TZ columns in data sources are mapped to TimestampType (or TimestampNTZType if isInferTimestampNTZ flag is true) it is not safe to do any shifting of timestamp values to match remote data source timezone because the fix for TZ columns would brake NTZ columns and vice versa. \r\n+ Therefore local session timezone of remote data source is set in beforeFetch so that remote data source takes care of this - This doesn't work for MSSQL dialect as it is not possible to set the session time zone.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR fixes support for set operations for strings with collations different from `UTF8_BINARY`. The fix is not strictly related to set operations and may resolve other problems in collation space. The fix is to add default value for `StringType` with collation. Previously the matching pattern would not catch the `StringType` with collation case and fix is simply to do pattern matching on `st: StringType` instead of relying on `StringType` match.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFixing behaviour of set operations.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes - fixing the logic that previously didn't work.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nGolden file tests are added.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses the problem of calculating the maximum concurrent tasks while evaluating the number of slots for barrier stages, specifically for the case when the task resource amount is greater than 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n``` scala\r\n  test(\"problem of calculating the maximum concurrent task\") {\r\n    withTempDir { dir =>\r\n      val discoveryScript = createTempScriptWithExpectedOutput(\r\n        dir, \"gpuDiscoveryScript\", \"\"\"{\"name\": \"gpu\",\"addresses\":[\"0\", \"1\", \"2\", \"3\"]}\"\"\")\r\n\r\n      val conf = new SparkConf()\r\n        // Setup a local cluster which would only has one executor with 2 CPUs and 1 GPU.\r\n        .setMaster(\"local-cluster[1, 6, 1024]\")\r\n        .setAppName(\"test-cluster\")\r\n        .set(WORKER_GPU_ID.amountConf, \"4\")\r\n        .set(WORKER_GPU_ID.discoveryScriptConf, discoveryScript)\r\n        .set(EXECUTOR_GPU_ID.amountConf, \"4\")\r\n        .set(TASK_GPU_ID.amountConf, \"2\")\r\n        // disable barrier stage retry to fail the application as soon as possible\r\n        .set(BARRIER_MAX_CONCURRENT_TASKS_CHECK_MAX_FAILURES, 1)\r\n      sc = new SparkContext(conf)\r\n      TestUtils.waitUntilExecutorsUp(sc, 1, 60000)\r\n\r\n      // Setup a barrier stage which contains 2 tasks and each task requires 1 CPU and 1 GPU.\r\n      // Therefore, the total resources requirement (2 CPUs and 2 GPUs) of this barrier stage\r\n      // can not be satisfied since the cluster only has 2 CPUs and 1 GPU in total.\r\n      assert(sc.parallelize(Range(1, 10), 2)\r\n        .barrier()\r\n        .mapPartitions { iter => iter }\r\n        .collect() sameElements Range(1, 10).toArray[Int])\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the described test scenario, the executor has 6 CPU cores and 4 GPUs, and each task requires 1 CPU core and 2 GPUs. Consequently, the maximum number of concurrent tasks should be 2. However, the issue arises when attempting to launch the subsequent 2 barrier tasks, as the 'checkBarrierStageWithNumSlots' function gets the incorrect concurrent task limit that is 1 instead of 2. The bug needs to be fixed.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe existing and newly added unit tests should pass\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2024-03-15T02:37:55Z","updated_at":"2024-04-01T02:39:24Z","closed_at":"2024-03-19T15:08:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ab8d2711f060f948b74b9bda0e65cf9722581488","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"tgravescs","id":4563792,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjM3OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4563792?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs","html_url":"https://github.com/tgravescs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45528/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45528/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/45528/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b0d90c03e0eec7dfc39da95f50fb1294dff2f019","head":{"label":"wbo4958:2-gpu","ref":"2-gpu","sha":"b0d90c03e0eec7dfc39da95f50fb1294dff2f019","user":{"login":"wbo4958","id":1320706,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjA3MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1320706?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wbo4958","html_url":"https://github.com/wbo4958","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wbo4958/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wbo4958/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wbo4958/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wbo4958/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wbo4958/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wbo4958/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wbo4958/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wbo4958/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wbo4958/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":245613513,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNDU2MTM1MTM=","name":"spark","full_name":"wbo4958/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wbo4958","id":1320706,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjA3MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1320706?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wbo4958","html_url":"https://github.com/wbo4958","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wbo4958/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wbo4958/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wbo4958/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wbo4958/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wbo4958/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wbo4958/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wbo4958/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wbo4958/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wbo4958/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wbo4958/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nLike SPARK-24553, this PR aims to fix redirect issues (incorrect 302) when one is using proxy settings. Change the generated link to be consistent with other links and include a trailing slash\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWhen using a proxy, an invalid redirect is issued if this is not included\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nOnly that people will be able to use these links if they are using a proxy\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nWith a proxy installed I went to the location this link would generate and could go to the page, when it redirects with the link as it exists.\r\n\r\nEdit: Further tested by building a version of our application with this patch applied, the links work now.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nPage with working link\r\n<img width=\"913\"

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd hooks to release the ANTLR DFA cache after parsing SQL\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nANTLR builds a DFA cache while parsing to speed up parsing of similar future inputs. However, this cache is never cleared and can only grow. Extremely large SQL inputs can lead to very large DFA caches (>20GiB in one extreme case I've seen).\r\n\r\nSpark’s ANTLR SQL parser is derived from the Presto ANTLR SQL Parser (see [SPARK-13713](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-13713) and https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/11557), and Presto has added hooks to be able to clear this DFA cache (https://github.com/trinodb/trino/pull/3186). I think Spark should have similar hooks.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNew `SQLConf` to control the behaviour (`spark.sql.parser.releaseAntlrCacheAfterParse`)\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew unit test\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo","created_at":"2024-03-14T22:00:33Z","updated_at":"2024-06-29T00:19:46Z","closed_at":"2024-06-29T00:19:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"82a9f350775776441baa7aed584020360ae8ce22","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"linhongliu-db","id":67896261,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3ODk2MjYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/67896261?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhongliu-db","html_url":"https://github.com/linhongliu-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhongliu-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhongliu-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhongliu-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhongliu-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhongliu-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhongliu-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhongliu-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhongliu-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linhongliu-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45526/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45526/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/45526/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a5a02c8761eecc6b7c00854943cbe59ab6614b0a","head":{"label":"markj-db:antlr-cache","ref":"antlr-cache","sha":"a5a02c8761eecc6b7c00854943cbe59ab6614b0a","user":{"login":"markj-db","id":63264495,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMjY0NDk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63264495?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markj-db","html_url":"https://github.com/markj-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markj-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markj-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markj-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markj-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markj-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markj-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markj-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markj-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markj-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":720206272,"node_id":"R_kgDOKu15wA","name":"spark","full_name":"markj-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"markj-db","id":63264495,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMjY0NDk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63264495?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markj-db","html_url":"https://github.com/markj-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markj-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markj-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markj-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markj-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markj-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markj-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markj-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWe are proposing to allow the users to have a custom `InMemoryTableScanExec`. To accomplish this we can follow the same convention we followed for `ShuffleExchangeLike` and `BroadcastExchangeLike` \r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn the PR added by @ulysses-you, we are wrapping `InMemoryTableScanExec` inside `TableCacheQueryStageExec`. This could potentially cause problems, especially in the RAPIDS Accelerator for Apache Spark, where we replace `InMemoryTableScanExec` with a customized version that has optimizations needed by us. This situation could lead to the loss of benefits from [SPARK-42101](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-42101) or even result in Spark throwing an Exception.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nRan the existing tests \r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo","created_at":"2024-03-14T18:51:06Z","updated_at":"2024-03-22T04:25:20Z","closed_at":"2024-03-21T19:46:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8f880f688c2ad1c607bfbe2af2fc14e382f60827","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"tgravescs","id":4563792,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjM3OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4563792?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs","html_url":"https://github.com/tgravescs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45525/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45525/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/45525/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f18a4cd6ba8423653d876d401b610ea14294e96f","head":{"label":"razajafri:extract-inmem-trait","ref":"extract-inmem-trait","sha":"f18a4cd6ba8423653d876d401b610ea14294e96f","user":{"login":"razajafri","id":8813002,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTMwMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8813002?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/razajafri","html_url":"https://github.com/razajafri","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/razajafri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/razajafri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/razajafri/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/razajafri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/razajafri/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/razajafri/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/razajafri/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/razajafri/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/razajafri/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":331725153,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzE3MjUxNTM=","name":"spark","full_name":"razajafri/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"razajafri","id":8813002,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTMwMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8813002?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/razajafri","html_url":"https://github.com/razajafri","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/razajafri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/razajafri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/razajafri/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/razajafri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/razajafri/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/razajafri/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/razajafri/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/razajafri/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/razajafri/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/razajafri/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/40755  adds a null check on the input of the child deserializer in the tuple encoder. It breaks the deserializer for the `Option` type, because null should be deserialized into `None` rather than null. This PR adds a boolean parameter to `ExpressionEncoder.tuple` so that only the user that https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/40755 intended to fix has this null check.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a follow-up to https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/45409. It refactors `supportsDataType` to use a non-recursive `supportsScalarDataType` method. This allows subclasses that just want to include or exclude one or two types to override with something like the following, rather than having to make a full copy of the recursive `supportsDataType` function, and risk getting out of sync as other types are changed in the base trait.\r\n\r\n```\r\noverride def supportsScalarDataType(dt: DataType): Boolean = {\r\n    dt.isInstanceOf[VariantType] || super.supportsScalarDataType(dt)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAllows subclasses to override the list of supported types with less duplicated code, and less risk of bugs.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-03-14T00:16:36Z","updated_at":"2024-03-14T12:53:03Z","closed_at":"2024-03-14T12:53:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"06a1b358c61a3c2937fd6613c9c0140447cdcf0b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45506/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45506/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/45506/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1ef05e705731d0c361b80e0941123f9dd2d009e3","head":{"label":"cashmand:SPARK-45827-CreatableRelationProvider-followup","ref":"SPARK-45827-CreatableRelationProvider-followup","sha":"1ef05e705731d0c361b80e0941123f9dd2d009e3","user":{"login":"cashmand","id":54722026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NzIyMDI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54722026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand","html_url":"https://github.com/cashmand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":469837514,"node_id":"R_kgDOHAEmyg","name":"spark","full_name":"cashmand/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cashmand","id":54722026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NzIyMDI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54722026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand","html_url":"https://github.com/cashmand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cashmand/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nMake the shutdown hook timeout configurable. If this is not defined it falls back to the existing behavior, which uses a default timeout of 30 seconds, or whatever is defined in core-site.xml for the hadoop.service.shutdown.timeout property.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSpark sometimes times out during the shutdown process. This can result in data left in the queues to be dropped and causes metadata loss (e.g. event logs, anything written by custom listeners). \r\n\r\nThis is not easily configurable before this change. The underlying `org.apache.hadoop.util.ShutdownHookManager` has a default timeout of 30 seconds.  It can be configured by setting hadoop.service.shutdown.timeout, but this must be done in the core-site.xml/core-default.xml because a new hadoop conf object is created and there is no opportunity to modify it.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, a new config `spark.shutdown.timeout` is added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManual testing in spark-shell. This behavior is not practical to write a unit test for.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2024-03-13T21:56:19Z","updated_at":"2024-03-18T17:36:41Z","closed_at":"2024-03-18T17:36:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"84307e360fdac86c6ed165e718926db5686bc44f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45504/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45504/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/45504/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a61a139db021632a07b7971a408ce3edc7e1a957","head":{"label":"robreeves:sc_shutdown_timeout","ref":"sc_shutdown_timeout","sha":"a61a139db021632a07b7971a408ce3edc7e1a957","user":{"login":"robreeves","id":5604993,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MDQ5OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5604993?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robreeves","html_url":"https://github.com/robreeves","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robreeves/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robreeves/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robreeves/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robreeves/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robreeves/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robreeves/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robreeves/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robreeves/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robreeves/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":524214006,"node_id":"R_kgDOHz7e9g","name":"spark","full_name":"robreeves/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"robreeves","id":5604993,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MDQ5OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5604993?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robreeves","html_url":"https://github.com/robreeves","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robreeves/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robreeves/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robreeves/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robreeves/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robreeves/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robreeves/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robreeves/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robreeves/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robreeves/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/robreeves/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd support for range scan based key state encoder for use with state store provider\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nChanges are needed to allow range scan of fixed size initial cols especially with RocksDB state store provider. Earlier we had tried to use the existing key state encoder to encapsulate state for ordering columns using BIG_ENDIAN encoding. However, that model does not work with variable sized non-ordering columns part of the grouping key, since in that case the variable length portion gets encoded upfront in the `UnsafeRow` thereby breaking the range scan/sorting functionality. In order to avoid this, we introduce a new key state encoder called `RangeScanKeyStateEncoder`. This allows the user to do the following:\r\n- create the state store instance or any column family with a key schema and the `RangeScanKeyStateEncoder` encoder type and the num of ordering cols being specified\r\n- with the new encoder, user can perform range scan in sorted order using ordering cols\r\n- with the new encoder, user can perform prefix scan using ordering cols\r\n- ordering cols have to be > 0 and <= num_key_schema_cols which is a more lenient requirement than `PrefixScanKeyStateEncoder`\r\n- only fixed size (primitive type) ordering cols can be used with this encoder\r\n\r\nInternally, we will convert the passed `UnsafeRow` into a new one that has the BIG_ENDIAN encoded byte arrays that are eventually written out to RocksDB.\r\n\r\nNote that the existing - `NoPrefixKeyStateEncoder` and `PrefixScanKeyStateEncoder` will also continue to be supported. The user can decide which encoder best fits the need of their store/col family schema/use.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nMove concurrency test to the `CollationFactorySuite`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis is more appropriate location for the test as it directly uses the `CollationFactory`.\r\n\r\nAlso, I just found out that `par` method is highly discouraged and that we should use `ParSeq` instead.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nWith existing UTs\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIn this PR we change the client behaviour to send the previously observed server session id so that the server can validate that the client used to talk with this specific session. Previously this was only validated on the client side which made the server actually execute the request for the wrong session before throwing on the client side (once the response from the server was obtained).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe server can execute the client command on the wrong spark session before client figuring out it's the different session.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nThe error message now pops up differently (it used to be a slightly different message when validated on the client).\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting unit tests, add new unit test, e2e test added, manual testing\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis addresses SPARK-47289 and adds a new section in explain plan where Spark extensions can add additional information for end users. The section is included in the output only if the relevant configuration is enabled and if the extension actually adds some new information\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nExtensions to Spark can add their own planning rules and sometimes may need to add additional information about how the plan was generated. This is useful for end users in determining if the extensions rules are working as intended.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nThis PR increases the information logged in the UI in the query plan. The attached screenshot shows output from an extension which provides some of its own operations but does not support some operations. \r\n\r\n<img width=\"703\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-03-11 at 10 23

Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2.

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThe current parser does not recognize CDATA sections and thus will read row tags that are enclosed within a CDATA section. The expected behavior is for none of the following rows to be read, but they are all read. \r\n\r\n```\r\n// BUG:  rowTag in CDATA section\r\nval xmlString=\"\"\"<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" ?>\r\n<test><![CDATA[\r\n    <elem id=\"1\" />\r\n    <elem id=\"2\" > </elem>\r\n    <elem> <id>3</id> </elem>\r\n]]>\r\n</test>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe changes proposed would make the tokenizer ignore the row elements within the CDATA section. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFor XML data to be read correctly.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nrowTags within CDATA tags in XML files are now properly ignored when read by Spark.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUnit tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n- Add a PySpark DataFrame method `toArrow()` which returns the contents of the DataFrame as a [PyArrow Table](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/generated/pyarrow.Table.html), for both local Spark and Spark Connect.\r\n- Add a new entry to the **Apache Arrow in PySpark** user guide page describing usage of the `toArrow()` method.\r\n- Add  a new option to the method `_collect_as_arrow()` to provide more useful output when there are zero records returned. (This keeps the implementation of `toArrow()` simpler.)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn the Apache Arrow community, we hear from a lot of users who want to return the contents of a PySpark DataFrame as a PyArrow Table. Currently the only documented way to do this is to return the contents as a pandas DataFrame, then use PyArrow (`pa`) to convert that to a PyArrow Table.\r\n```py\r\npa.Table.from_pandas(df.toPandas())\r\n```\r\nBut going through pandas adds significant overhead which is easily avoided since internally `toPandas()` already converts the contents of Spark DataFrame to Arrow format as an intermediate step when `spark.sql.execution.arrow.pyspark.enabled` is `true`.\r\n\r\nCurrently it is also possible to use the experimental `_collect_as_arrow()` method to return the contents of a PySpark DataFrame as a list of PyArrow RecordBatches. This PR adds a new non-experimental method `toArrow()` which returns the more user-friendly PyArrow Table object.\r\n\r\nThis PR also adds a new argument `empty_list_if_zero_records` to the experimental method `_collect_as_arrow()` to control what the method returns in the case when the result data has zero rows. If set to `True` (the default), the existing behavior is preserved, and the method returns an empty Python list. If set to `False`, the method returns returns a length-one list containing an empty Arrow RecordBatch which includes the schema. This is used by `toArrow()` which requires the schema even if the data has zero rows.\r\n\r\nFor Spark Connect, there is already a `SparkSession.client.to_table()` method that returns a PyArrow table. This PR uses that to expose `toArrow()` for Spark Connect.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\n- It adds a DataFrame method `toArrow()` to the PySpark SQL DataFrame API.\r\n- It adds a new argument `empty_list_if_zero_records` to the experimental DataFrame method `_collect_as_arrow()` with a default value which preserves the method's existing behavior.\r\n- It exposes `toArrow()` for Spark Connect, via the existing `SparkSession.client.to_table()` method.\r\n- It does not introduce any other user-facing changes.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThis adds a new test and a new helper function for the test in `pyspark/sql/tests/test_arrow.py`.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the implementation of the `parse_json` expression to replace the current fake implementation. This expression parses a JSON string as a variant value. It throws an exception when the string is not a valid JSON value or when the resulting variant cannot fit into the size limit.\r\n\r\nThis feature is achieved by introducing a library`common/variant`. It includes the utility functions to build and manipulate binary-encoded variant values. It also contains a `README` that describes the variant binary format. It is intended that this library can be used outside of Spark.\r\n\r\nSome usage examples of `parse_json`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nselect parse_json('{\"a\": 1, \"b\": 2}');\r\n\r\ncreate table variant_table as select parse_json(j) as v from json_table;\r\n\r\nselect parse_json('[');\r\n-- will throw an exception because the input is not valid JSON\r\n\r\nselect parse_json('\"' || repeat('a', 16 * 1024 * 1024) || '\"');\r\n-- will throw an exception because the variant exceeds the size limit\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, the `parse_json` expression will return an actual binary-encoded variant value rather than the original placeholder value.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests that validate the `parse_json` result. Negative cases where the expression fail on invalid/large JSON are also covered.\r\n\r\nSome unit tests need to be temporarily disabled because the `toString` implementation doesn't match the `parse_json` implementation yet. I will shortly add a new `toString` implementation and re-enable them.\r\n","created_at":"2024-03-12T20:26:50Z","updated_at":"2024-03-25T00:00:11Z","closed_at":"2024-03-15T00:17:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1dd493c8832892a8df4c63b41ab167b4ed85597d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982110661,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMTEwNjYx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/INFRA","name":"INFRA","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45479/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45479/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/45479/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/82120fc63ce72fbc691b953dd4762000489af615","head":{"label":"chenhao-db:parse_json","ref":"parse_json","sha":"82120fc63ce72fbc691b953dd4762000489af615","user":{"login":"chenhao-db","id":122326661,"node_id":"U_kgDOB0qOhQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/122326661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db","html_url":"https://github.com/chenhao-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":608298960,"node_id":"R_kgDOJEHn0A","name":"oss","full_name":"chenhao-db/oss","private":false,"owner":{"login":"chenhao-db","id":122326661,"node_id":"U_kgDOB0qOhQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/122326661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db","html_url":"https://github.com/chenhao-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.githu

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to make `PluginEndpoint` warn when plugins reply for one-way message.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nPreviously, it logs `INFO` level messages. Sometimes, it look 66% driver INFO logs. We had better increase the log level to make the users fix the issues.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo. Only a log level.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-03-12T17:48:16Z","updated_at":"2024-03-12T19:44:31Z","closed_at":"2024-03-12T19:44:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b1014d07b89336a526ebc76c59c27104f9364af0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45478/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45478/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/45478/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/391fd1597b69e5b2aed78b910f426b099b5d8b55","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-47364","ref":"SPARK-47364","sha":"391fd1597b69e5b2aed78b910f426b099b5d8b55","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":677218341,"node_id":"R_kgDOKF2IJQ","name":"spark","full_name":"dongjoon-hyun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun/spark","description":"Apache

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIn this PR we propose to extend the lexing of IDENTIFIER beyond what is legitimate for unquoted identifiers to include\r\n\"plausible\" identifiers. We then use the \"exit\" hook in the parser raise INVALID_IDENTIFIER error which is more meaningful than a syntax error.\r\n\r\nSpecifically we allow:\r\n* general letters beyond the ASCII a-z. This will catch locale specific names\r\n* URIs which are used for table's represented by a path.\r\n\r\nAs part of this PR we also found that rolling `NOT` and `!` into one token is a \"bad idea\".\r\nWe allow:\r\n\r\nCREATE TABLE t(c1 INT ! NULL); etc.\r\nThis is clearly not intended.\r\n\r\n! is now ONLY allowed as a boolean prefix operator.\r\n \r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis change  improves the user experience in case of an error by returning a more meaningful error.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nExisting test suite + new unit tests\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR adds support for users to provide a Dataframe that can be used to instantiate state for the query in the first batch for arbitrary state API v2.\r\n\r\nNote that populating the initial state will only happen for the first batch of the new streaming query. Trying to re-initialize state for the same grouping key will result in an error.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThese changes are needed to support initial state. The changes are part of the work around adding new stateful streaming operator for arbitrary state mgmt that provides a bunch of new features listed in the SPIP JIRA here - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-45939\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes.\r\nThis PR introduces a new function: \r\n```\r\ndef transformWithState(\r\n      statefulProcessor: StatefulProcessorWithInitialState[K, V, U, S],\r\n      timeoutMode: TimeoutMode,\r\n      outputMode: OutputMode,\r\n      initialState: KeyValueGroupedDataset[K, S]): Dataset[U] \r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nMake Kubernetes resource manager support existing config `spark.ui.custom.executor.log.url`.\r\n\r\nAllow for\r\n\r\n    spark.ui.custom.executor.log.url=\"https://my.custom.url/logs?app={{APP_ID}}&executor={{EXECUTOR_ID}}\"\r\n\r\nSupports these variables:\r\n\r\n- <code>APP_ID</code>: The unique application id\r\n- <code>EXECUTOR_ID</code>: The executor id (a positive integer larger than zero)\r\n- <code>HOSTNAME</code>: The name of the host where the executor runs\r\n- <code>KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE</code>: The namespace where the executor pods run\r\n- <code>KUBERNETES_POD_NAME</code>: The name of the pod that contains the executor\r\n- <code>FILE_NAME</code>: The name of the log, which is always <code>\"log\"</code>\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nRunning Spark on Kubernetes requires persisting the logs elsewhere. Having the Spark UI link to those logs is very useful. This is currently only supported by YARN.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nSpark UI provides links to logs when run on Kubernetes.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit test and manually tested on minikube K8S cluster.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo","created_at":"2024-03-11T14:23:48Z","updated_at":"2024-08-14T15:39:30Z","closed_at":"2024-07-31T00:17:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6ed642470e71bfbce40a216ad238ffaa5189255c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605057,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/KUBERNETES","name":"KUBERNETES","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1406605079,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDc5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/WEB%20UI","name":"WEB

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/45409 created a default allow-list of types for data sources. The intent was to only prevent creation of the two types that had already been prevented elsewhere in code, but the match expression matched `StringType`, which is an object representing the default collation, instead of the `StringType` class, which represents any collation. This PR fixes the issue.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWithout it, the previous PR would be a breaking change for data sources that write StringType with a non-default collation.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nIt reverts the previous unintentional user-facing change.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit test.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-03-11T14:03:53Z","updated_at":"2024-03-11T17:57:31Z","closed_at":"2024-03-11T17:57:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8c4f64c0dac64d4c916ab658497077d5a3993457","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45463/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45463/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/45463/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/073fdaa035cca681caa7c27241c5400970d1d008","head":{"label":"cashmand:SPARK-45827-followup","ref":"SPARK-45827-followup","sha":"073fdaa035cca681caa7c27241c5400970d1d008","user":{"login":"cashmand","id":54722026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NzIyMDI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54722026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand","html_url":"https://github.com/cashmand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":469837514,"node_id":"R_kgDOHAEmyg","name":"spark","full_name":"cashmand/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cashmand","id":54722026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NzIyMDI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54722026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand","html_url":"https://github.com/cashmand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cashmand/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn this PR I propose a change to add new error class NULL_QUERY_STRING_EXECUTE_IMMEDIATE that is thrown when sqlString variable is a null string in execute immediate query. Null pointer exception was thrown before this change.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo ensure that user facing error is as clear as possible and to avoid NPE for possible user input.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. This PR introduces a new error class that has an user facing description.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running an \"EXEC IMMEDIATE - Null string as sqlString parameter\" test from AnalysisErrorSuite. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2024-03-11T13:58:04Z","updated_at":"2024-03-13T17:42:17Z","closed_at":"2024-03-12T11:27:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"33fdadcf32425cad3e3aa04a72bd083052601231","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45462/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45462/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/45462/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/350a606fe37d96aae163a0d1e9ec608c7ae5a5f5","head":{"label":"stefanbuk-db:ES-1055420_fix-ExecuteImmediateQuery-sqlString-null","ref":"ES-1055420_fix-ExecuteImmediateQuery-sqlString-null","sha":"350a606fe37d96aae163a0d1e9ec608c7ae5a5f5","user":{"login":"stefanbuk-db","id":161319309,"node_id":"U_kgDOCZ2JjQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/161319309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanbuk-db","html_url":"https://github.com/stefanbuk-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanbuk-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanbuk-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanbuk-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanbuk-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanbuk-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanbuk-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanbuk-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanbuk-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanbuk-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":765608789,"node_id":"R_kgDOLaJDVQ","name":"spark","full_name":"stefanbuk-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"stefanbuk-db","id":161319309,"node_id":"U_kgDOCZ2JjQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/161319309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanbuk-db","html_url":"https://github.com/stefanbuk-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanbuk-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanbuk-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanbuk-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanbuk-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanbuk-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanbuk-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanbuk-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanbuk-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanbuk-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/stefanbuk-db/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nA few [tests](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/connector/connect/client/jvm/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/connect/client/SparkConnectClientSuite.scala#L481-L527) in SparkConnectClientSuite attempt to test the result collection of a reattachable execution through the use of a SQL command. The SQL command, on a real server, is not executed eagerly (since it is a select command) and thus, is not entirely accurate. The test itself is non-problematic since a dummy server with dummy responses is used but a small improvement here would be to construct a relation rather than a command.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAlthough these tests are not problematic, we should ensure that the behavior of the tests is consistent with the actual behavior of real servers to avoid misleading developers.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nThe tests in org.apache.spark.sql.connect.client.SparkConnectClientSuite passed.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for details.\r\n-->\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-03-11T13:39:45Z","updated_at":"2024-03-11T23:50:42Z","closed_at":"2024-03-11T23:50:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"69dfe93b3e0fb01249b64d557b2c03bbb3dfc360","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45460/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45460/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/45460/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d44919dc73ecec4408f85098d67fb2b98e31e20d","head":{"label":"xi-db:SPARK-47341-fix-misleading-tests","ref":"SPARK-47341-fix-misleading-tests","sha":"d44919dc73ecec4408f85098d67fb2b98e31e20d","user":{"login":"xi-db","id":159039256,"node_id":"U_kgDOCXq_GA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/159039256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db","html_url":"https://github.com/xi-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":757362931,"node_id":"R_kgDOLSRw8w","name":"spark","full_name":"xi-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xi-db","id":159039256,"node_id":"U_kgDOCXq_GA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/159039256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db","html_url":"https://github.com/xi-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xi-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xi-db/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to introduce `UNCLASSIFIED` for default error class when error class is not defined.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn Spark, when an `errorClass` is not explicitly defined for an exception, the method `getErrorClass` returns null so far.\r\n\r\nThis behavior can lead to ambiguity and makes debugging more challenging by not providing a clear indication that the error class was not set.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo API changes, but the user-facing error message will contain `UNCLASSIFIED` when error class is not specified.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUpdated the existing UT (`SparkThrowableSuite`)\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2024-03-11T08:12:22Z","updated_at":"2024-07-24T23:59:50Z","closed_at":"2024-07-24T23:59:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"784bfa6e7fce122e9458d1ef5d48b2e68a262a77","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED
