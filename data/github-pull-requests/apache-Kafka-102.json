have been seeing increased flakiness in transaction system tests. I believe the cause might be due to KIP-537, which increased the default zk session timeout from 6s to 18s and the default replica lag timeout from 10s to 30s. In the system test, we use the default transaction timeout of 10s. However, since the system test involves hard failures, the Produce request could be blocking for as long as the max of these two in order to wait for an ISR shrink. Hence this patch increases the timeout to 30s.\r\n\r\nNote this patch also includes a minor logging fix in `Partition`. Previously we would see messages like the following:\r\n```\r\n[Broker id=3] Leader output-topic-0 starts at leader epoch 0 from offset 0 with high watermark 0 ISR 3,2,1 addingReplicas  removingReplicas .Previous leader epoch was -1.\r\n```\r\nThis patch fixes the log to print as the following:\r\n```\r\n[Broker id=3] Leader output-topic-0 starts at leader epoch 0 from offset 0 with high watermark 0 ISR [3,2,1] addingReplicas []  removingReplicas []. Previous leader epoch was -1.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n-

recently added assertion in Connect integration tests uses `consumer#partitionsFor` to verify that a topic was created with the expected number of partitions and replicas. However, probably because of metadata propagation delays, this call doesn't always return a valid `PartitionInfo` for the topic that has just been created and the test is terminated with a NPE. \r\n\r\nThis commit changes the assertion to perform retries in order to verify the topic settings and uses the admin client instead.\r\n\r\nTests have been adjusted to use the new assertion. \r\n

The Outer loop Issue, at Original line 134 of FileStreamSourceTask.java \r\n\twhile (readerCopy.ready()) {\r\n\r\nSince the buffer is used cross multiple poll. This condition missed a case that file has reached EOF, but buffer has un-parsed data. \r\n\r\nTo fix it, change the while loop to if statement, and move the file reading logic to extractLine\r\n        if (offset < buffer.length && reader.ready()) {\r\n\r\nTest case: FileStreamSourceTaskTest.testSmallFile\r\n\r\n2.

Connect workers have been able to create Connect's internal topics using the new admin client for some time now (see KAFKA-4667). However, tasks of source connectors are still relying upon the broker to auto-create topics with default config settings if they don't exist, or expect these topics to exist before the connector is deployed, if their configuration needs to be specialized. \r\n\r\nWith the implementation of KIP-158 here, if `topic.creation.enable=true`, Kafka Connect will supply the source tasks of connectors that are configured to create topics with an admin client that will allow them to create new topics on-the-fly before writing the first source records to a new topic. Additionally, each source connector has the opportunity to customize the topic-specific settings of these new topics by defining groups of topic configurations. \r\n\r\nThis feature is tested here via unit tests (old tests that have been adjusted and new ones) as well as integration tests.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n-

KIP-392, we added logic to make sure that high watermark changes are propagated to followers without delay in order to improve end to end latency when fetching from followers. The downside of this change is that it increases the rate of fetch requests from followers which can have a noticeable impact on performance (see KAFKA-9731). \r\n\r\nTo fix that problem, we have already modified the code so that we only propagate high watermark changes immediately when a replica selector is used (which is not the default). However, leaving this logic around means that it is risky to enable follower fetching since it changes the follower request rate, which can have a big impact on overall broker performance. \r\n\r\nThis patch disables immediate propagation of the high watermark more generally. Instead, users can use the max wait time in order to control the worst-case latency. Note that this is typically only a problem anyway for low-throughput clusters since otherwise we will always have a steady rate of high watermark updates.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from

mirrors how the KafkaProducer constructors are organised and reduce\r\ncode duplication.\r\n\r\nMore specifically this PR makes the following changes without changing any behaviour or public API:\r\n\r\n1. Move the helper method `propsToMap()` from `KafkaProducer` to `Utils` with the other\r\nsimilar helpers `mkMap()` and `mkProperties()`, as this is now both used by `KafkaConsumer` and `KafkaProducer`.\r\n2. Move the `ConsumerConfig` instantiation to the constructor that actually does the work.\r\n3. Remove the `addDeserializerToConfig()` that operates on `Properties` and it's two tests, as all of those are very similar to the ones that operate on `Map<String, Object>` instances.\r\n4. Have the `KafkaConsumer` constructors that accept `Properties` parameter convert those early to `Map<String, Object>` instances.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ]

detailed description of your change,\r\nif necessary. The PR title and PR message become\r\nthe squashed commit message, so use a separate\r\ncomment to ping reviewers.*\r\n\r\n1. Added a new common client configuration parameter socket.connection.setup.timeout.ms to the NetworkClient. Handle potential transportation layer timeout using the same approach as it handling potential request timeout.\r\n2. When no connected channel exists, leastLoadedNode() will now provide a disconnected node that has the least recent connection attempts. \r\n3. ClusterConnectionStates will keep the connecting node ids. Now it also has several new public methods to provide per connection relavant data.\r\n\r\n*Summary of testing strategy (including rationale)\r\nfor the feature or bug fix. Unit and/or integration\r\ntests are expected for any behaviour change and\r\nsystem tests should be considered for larger changes.*\r\n\r\n1. A unit test for the basic functionality of the new configuration\r\n2. A unit test for optimized leastLoadedNode()\r\n3. Use docker scenarios for system tests. May add a duckertape test.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify

this PR, I have implemented various classes and integration for the read path of the feature versioning system ([KIP-584](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-584%3A+Versioning+scheme+for+features)). The ultimate plan is that the cluster-wide **finalized** features information is going to be stored in ZK under the node `/feature`. The read path implemented in this PR is centered around reading this **finalized** features information from ZK, and, processing it inside the Broker.\r\n\r\nHere is a summary of what's in this PR (a lot of it is **new** classes):\r\n\r\n - A facility is provided in the broker to declare it's supported features, and advertise it's supported features via it's own `BrokerIdZNode` under a `features` key.\r\n- A facility is provided in the broker to listen to and propagate cluster-wide **finalized** feature changes from ZK.\r\n- When new **finalized** features are read from ZK, feature incompatibilities are detected by comparing against the broker's own supported features.\r\n- `ApiVersionsResponse` is now served containing supported and finalized feature information (using the newly added tagged fields).\r\n\r\nMore details below.\r\n\r\n**New IBP config value:**\r\nThe feature versioning system is implemented such that it is activated only if the IBP >= `KAFKA_2_7_IV0` (newly defined value in this PR). That is because, we would like to keep the feature version system disabled (almost as if it is non-existent) until the user upgrades the cluster to or beyond IBP `KAFKA_2_7_IV0`.\r\n\r\n**New common libraries (Java):**\r\n\r\nA set of common libraries abstracting features have been introduced. Features are a map with key being `String` (feature name) and value being a  `VersionRangeType` (the range of supported or finalized versions for the feature). These common libraries are defined as 4 new classes in: `org.apache.kafka.common.feature.{Features, BaseVersionRange, SupportedVersionRange, FinalizedVersionRange}`.\r\n\r\nThe reason why it is kept in this common package is that future client and tooling development could reuse some/all of these abstractions.\r\n\r\n**New broker libraries (Scala):**\r\n\r\nThe above common libraries are used within the Broker code to implement the read path for feature information, as explained below.\r\n   1. **`FinalizedFeatureCache`**: Implemented a cache of cluster-wide finalized features (see companion object: `FinalizedFeatureCache`). This cache stores the latest finalized features and epoch read from the `/feature` node in ZK. Currently the main reader of this cache is the read path that serves an `ApiVersionsRequest` returning the features information in the response. In the future, as we start using the versioning system more, the cache could be read by future read paths intending to learn the finalized feature information. **Note:** this is defined as a companion object (a singleton),  because, this way it will be easy to share read access with any code path in the Broker.\r\n   2. **`FinalizedFeatureChangeListener`**: Implemented a feature ZK node change listener, that, listens to changes in the `/feature` node in ZK, and, invalidates the cache defined in `FinalizedFeatureCache` (see above point). See class: `FinalizedFeatureChangeListener`.  An instance of this class is maintained in `KafkaServer`, and initialized only if the IBP is set to `KAFKA_2_7_IV0` or higher.\r\n   3. **`SupportedFeatures`**: Implemented a facility to define supported features within the Broker (these are specific to a broker binary). See companion object: `SupportedFeatures`. Currently the list of supported features is empty, because, we have not identified features (yet). In the future this class can be populated as we begin to define supported features. Also, the public interface of this class provides a way to compare supported vs finalized features to detect incompatibilities. **Note:** this is a companion object (a singleton), because, it makes it easy to define supported features at a common point and also share read access with any code path in the Broker.\r\n\r\n**New Zookeeper node: `/feature`:**\r\nThe finalized feature information is going to be stored in ZK under the node `/feature`.\r\n1. The class backing the new node is `FeatureZNode`. It provides required state and encode/decode APIs that abstract the structure of the new feature ZK node.\r\n2. Implemented new APIs in `KafkaZkClient.scala` to read/update/delete the `/feature` ZK node.\r\n\r\n**Broker advertisements:**\r\nA facility is provided in the broker to declare it's supported features (via the `SupportedFeatures` class), and advertise it's supported features via it's own `BrokerIdZNode` under a `features` key (only if IBP >=`KAFKA_2_7_IV0`). The encode/decode logic for the new `features` key is provided in this PR in the class `BrokerIdZNode`.\r\n  \r\n**Updated ApiVersionsResponse**:\r\n\r\nDefined new tagged fields in existing `ApiVersionsResponse` schema. In the request serving path (in `KafkaApis.scala`), these fields are populated in the response with the latest supported features (from `SupportedFeatures`) and latest finalized features (from `FinalizedFeatureCache`).\r\n\r\n**Tests:**\r\nAdded test suites for all of the new classes, and changes made in this PR.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2020-05-17T09:00:58Z","updated_at":"2020-06-11T18:28:58Z","closed_at":"2020-06-11T18:28:57Z","merged_at":"2020-06-11T18:28:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"4f96c5b424956355339dd3216c426c1c0388fe9e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/8680/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/8680/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/8680/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/8e3ef56c552da13226c1fcc472c8d339fb98c7a8","head":{"label":"kowshik:kip584_features_read_path","ref":"kip584_features_read_path","sha":"8e3ef56c552da13226c1fcc472c8d339fb98c7a8","user":{"login":"kowshik","id":216151,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNjE1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/216151?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik","html_url":"https://github.com/kowshik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":239427959,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzk0Mjc5NTk=","name":"kafka","full_name":"kowshik/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kowshik","id":216151,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNjE1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/216151?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik","html_url":"https://github.com/kowshik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kowshik/kafka","description":"Mirror

Update checkpoint files once for all deleted partitions instead of updating them for each deleted partitions. With this, a stop replica requests with 2000 partitions to be deleted takes ~2 secs instead of ~40 secs previously.\r\n* Refactor the checkpointing methods to not compute the `logsByDir` all the time. It is now reused as much as possible.\r\n* Refactor the exception handling. Some checkpointing methods were handling `IOException` but the underlying write process already catches them and throws KafkaStorageException instead.\r\n* Reduce the logging in the log cleaner manager. It does not log anymore when a partition is deleted as it is not a useful information.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ]

seems to be the final piece in the EosBetaUpgradeTest flakiness puzzle. From time to time the listOffsets request would fail during the initial startup rebalance, causing a probing rebalance to be scheduled for 10 min later (rather than immediately after). The assignor was newly creating the changelogs and then almost immediately calling `listOffsets` which then failed as the internal topics were not yet ready.\r\n\r\nTo avoid this race condition, we keep track of which changelogs we just created and skip fetching the end offsets for them. If a changelog did not exist before this moment, we can safely assume that its end offset is zero.","created_at":"2020-05-12T22:45:01Z","updated_at":"2020-05-15T01:01:08Z","closed_at":"2020-05-14T20:53:29Z","merged_at":"2020-05-14T20:53:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"4e722021a916a2a4183210dae70e6c95df2b5593","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/8662/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/8662/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/8662/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/df24f6e351160de97ae664daf4f433abf54334d1","head":{"label":"ableegoldman:HOTFIX-dont-fetch-offsets-for-new-changelogs","ref":"HOTFIX-dont-fetch-offsets-for-new-changelogs","sha":"df24f6e351160de97ae664daf4f433abf54334d1","user":{"login":"ableegoldman","id":4843099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NDMwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4843099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman","html_url":"https://github.com/ableegoldman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":166325386,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjYzMjUzODY=","name":"kafka","full_name":"ableegoldman/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ableegoldman","id":4843099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NDMwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4843099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman","html_url":"https://github.com/ableegoldman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ableegoldman/kafka","description":"Mirror

state stores turn on bulk loading of the underlying RocksDB\r\nwhen restoring. This is correct for segmented state stores that\r\nare in restore mode on active tasks and the onRestoreStart() and\r\nonRestoreEnd() in RocksDBSegmentsBatchingRestoreCallback take care\r\nof toggling bulk loading mode on and off. However, restoreAll()\r\nin RocksDBSegmentsBatchingRestoreCallback might also turn on bulk loading\r\nmode. When this happens on a stand-by task bulk loading mode is never\r\nturned off. That leads to steadily increasing open file descriptors\r\nin RocksDB because in bulk loading mode RocksDB creates continuously new\r\nfiles but never compacts them (which is the intended behaviour).\r\n\r\nThis PR checks whether the task is an active task before turning on bulk \r\nloading mode in restoreAll() for segmented state stores.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from

has passed.**\r\n\r\nExpanded the allowed values for the internal topics’ replication factor and partitions from positive values to also include -1 to signify that the broker defaults should be used.\r\n\r\nThe Kafka storage classes were already constructing a `NewTopic` object (always with a replication factor and partitions) and sending it to Kafka when required. This change will avoid setting the replication factor and/or number of partitions on this `NewTopic` if the worker configuration uses -1 for the corresponding configuration value.\r\n\r\nQuite a few new tests were added to verify that the `TopicAdmin` utility class is correctly using the AdminClient, that the `DistributedConfig` validators for these configurations are correct, and that the `DistributedConfig` is correctly assembling the configuration properties that define the topic settings, which are now accessed by the three Kafka storage objects before they create the topics.\r\n\r\nAlso added support for additional topic settings used when creating the config, status, and offset internal topics. \r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [

to this fix a plugged-in verifiable client, such as\r\nconfluent-kafka-python, would be deployed on the node in the background\r\nworker thread as the client was started. Since this could be time consuming\r\n(e.g., 10+ seconds) and since the main test thread would continue to\r\noperate, it was common for the current test to time out waiting\r\nfor e.g. the verifiable producer to produce messages while it was in fact\r\nstill deploying.\r\n\r\nThe fix here is to deploy the verifiable client on the node when\r\nthe verifiable client is instantiated, which is thus a blocking\r\noperation on the main test thread, avoiding any test-based timeouts.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ]

to KAFKA-8106, we allowed the v0 and v1 message formats to contain non-consecutive inner offsets. Inside `LogValidator`, we would detect this case and rewrite the batch. After KAFKA-8106, we changed the logic to raise an error in the case of the v1 message format (v0 was still expected to be rewritten). This caused an incompatibility for older clients which were depending on the looser validation. This patch reverts the old logic of rewriting the batch to fix the invalid inner offsets.\r\n\r\nNote that the v2 message format has always had stricter validation. This patch also adds a test case for this.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build

java.lang.AssertionError: Expected: is <0L> but: was <43L> at org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert.assertThat(MatcherAssert.java:20) at org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert.assertThat(MatcherAssert.java:6) at org.apache.kafka.streams.integration.OptimizedKTableIntegrationTest.shouldApplyUpdatesToStandbyStore(OptimizedKTableIntegrationTest.java:138)\r\n\r\nThe tests failed at `assertThat(listener.startOffset, is(equalTo(0L)));`. It looks like that it did a restore before the assert. But we should expect the restore sometimes happen to resume the failed tasks by itself. It should not cause the test failure under this situation. \r\n\r\nOn the other hands, I checked the original tests in below PR link:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/7238/files#diff-7b659da73450d5bf7a1731b5606e4c83R205\r\nThe original tests added the `assertThat(listener.startOffset, is(equalTo(0L)));` is because in the end of the test, we'll also test the `startOffset` value. But in the newer version of the test, we don't really care about the `startOffset` or `totalNumRestored`  value. All we want to test in this test is:\r\n**Assert that the current value in store reflects all messages being processed** \r\n\r\nSo, removing the assert can avoid flaky test failure, and also be able to test what the test case want to test.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build
