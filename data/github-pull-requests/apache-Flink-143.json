you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nRefactors existing code to use the new data structures interfaces.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nThe commints in the order:\r\n- [table-common] Add necessary methods to internal data structures\r\n- [table-common] Add binary implementations of internal data structures\r\n- [table-runtime-blink] Implement all the data structures and serializers around RowData\r\n- [table-runtime-blink] Remove legacy data formats (BaseRow)\r\n- [table-blink] Refactor planner and runtime to use new data structures\r\n- [python] Refactor pyflink to use new data structures\r\n- [parquet] Refactor parquet connector to use new data structures\r\n- [orc] Refactor ORC connector to use new data structures\r\n- [hive] Refactor Hive connector to use new data structures\r\n\r\nSome notable changes: \r\n- In code generation, we hard cast `StringData` to `BinaryStringData`. This makes the code generator easily to generate opeartions based on string. The same to `RawValueData`. \r\n- Most methods of `Decimal` have been moved to `DecimalDateUtil`. So I also updated the code generation logic.\r\n- Remove `RecordEqualiser#equalsWithoutHeader` interface. This method is used less and can be replaced by `RecordEqualiser#equals`. This can also avoid add `equalsWithoutHeader` method to the public API `GenericRowData`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is covered by existing tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: yes\r\n  - The serializers: yes\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): yes\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the unstable input channel test.\r\n\r\nCurrently some test might be unstable with specific thread concurrency when we simulating the cases that recycling exclusive and floating buffers in different threads.

Therefore, we could change the recycling into the same thread.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- c9d0fc65ad8da1f3295d3fb608967ddb471bb370 fixes the unstable tests.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this

What is the purpose of the change\r\n[FLINK-17401]  Currently labels are not set in the task info object. A lot of companies can have logic specific to labels on TM. For example in criteo, based on labels we set kerberos env variables and mesos debug capabilities. It is critical for us to be able to pass these label values to the task manager.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nReading the labels as map structure from flink config and pass it to mesos task parameters. TaskInfo object is populated with the labels by LaunchableMesosWorker.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper:  don't know\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? yes\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nIncreased timeouts of UnalignedCheckpointITCase.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Increased timeouts of UnalignedCheckpointITCase.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThere is some spelling mistakes in state_processor_api.md, E.g  ”getExecutionEnviornment“.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n modify state_processor_api.md doc.\r\n","created_at":"2020-04-27T09:02:02Z","updated_at":"2020-04-27T16:12:50Z","closed_at":"2020-04-27T16:12:50Z","merged_at":"2020-04-27T16:12:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"9a96609c6d24e92b59db1ecf3c05278b26747708","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/11919/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/11919/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/11919/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/14d41ad5c3dd6c319ae1f8a6c5b8dbe617bbc29c","head":{"label":"caozhen1937:changedoc","ref":"changedoc","sha":"14d41ad5c3dd6c319ae1f8a6c5b8dbe617bbc29c","user":{"login":"caozhen1937","id":28433016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NDMzMDE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28433016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caozhen1937","html_url":"https://github.com/caozhen1937","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caozhen1937/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caozhen1937/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caozhen1937/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caozhen1937/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caozhen1937/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caozhen1937/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caozhen1937/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caozhen1937/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caozhen1937/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":179279367,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzkyNzkzNjc=","name":"flink","full_name":"caozhen1937/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"caozhen1937","id":28433016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NDMzMDE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28433016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caozhen1937","html_url":"https://github.com/caozhen1937","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caozhen1937/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caozhen1937/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caozhen1937/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caozhen1937/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caozhen1937/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caozhen1937/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caozhen1937/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caozhen1937/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caozhen1937/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/caozhen1937/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR fix the problem that requested/allocated containers cannot be matched on Hadoop 2.10+.\r\n\r\nThe problem is due to relying on the hash code of the Hadoop abstract class `Resource` for mapping, which is calculated inconsistently by different `Resource` implementations.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- Add `WorkerSpecContainerResourceAdapterTest#testMatchResourceWithDifferentImplementation`.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

\"Hive Integration\" into Chinese\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed,

Chinese\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nRemove useless FlinkYarnSessionCli#logAndSysout method\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2020-04-25T02:59:26Z","updated_at":"2020-05-27T13:07:58Z","closed_at":"2020-05-27T13:07:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3421ff9af74d4324d2863f556de7ed685f6a7a4e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/11908/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/11908/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/11908/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/9c21872fb88b20f94c323231adda9f718a544a81","head":{"label":"zzchun:remove-useless-method","ref":"remove-useless-method","sha":"9c21872fb88b20f94c323231adda9f718a544a81","user":{"login":"zzchun","id":33080263,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMDgwMjYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33080263?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun","html_url":"https://github.com/zzchun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":118125414,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTgxMjU0MTQ=","name":"flink","full_name":"zzchun/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zzchun","id":33080263,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMDgwMjYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33080263?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun","html_url":"https://github.com/zzchun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zzchun/flink","description":"Mirror

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nRemove useless FlinkYarnSessionCli#logAndSysout method\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2020-04-25T01:22:38Z","updated_at":"2020-04-25T01:26:36Z","closed_at":"2020-04-25T01:25:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"187ccdaac8fd5e9d1f1bee8e9a45ff6bada5cfaa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/11907/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/11907/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/11907/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/0158e11e5880598517b50c9477ee52cab1c0a204","head":{"label":"zzchun:remove-useless-code","ref":"remove-useless-code","sha":"0158e11e5880598517b50c9477ee52cab1c0a204","user":{"login":"zzchun","id":33080263,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMDgwMjYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33080263?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun","html_url":"https://github.com/zzchun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":118125414,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTgxMjU0MTQ=","name":"flink","full_name":"zzchun/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zzchun","id":33080263,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMDgwMjYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33080263?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun","html_url":"https://github.com/zzchun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzchun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zzchun/flink","description":"Mirror

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nSupport the reading of PK and Unique constraints when reading JDBC tables. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Modified PostgresCatalog in order to read PK and Unique constraints*\r\n  - *Set DataType of columns mentioned in those constraints as non-null*\r\n  - *Added unique constraint list to TableSchema*\r\n  - *Renamed value in UniqueConstraint from UNIQUE_KEY to UNIQUE*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *PostgresCatalogTestBase.java *.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): **no**\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: **no**\r\n  - The serializers: **no**\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): **no**\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper:**no**\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: **no**\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? **no**\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? not documented\r\n","created_at":"2020-04-24T19:43:51Z","updated_at":"2022-03-17T15:37:01Z","closed_at":"2020-05-20T14:27:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ae77595350ed48e62777a7eaf69809240a7a2066","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1278775149,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjc4Nzc1MTQ5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Connectors/JDBC","name":"component=Connectors/JDBC","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1292353221,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjkyMzUzMjIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/Ecosystem","name":"component=TableSQL/Ecosystem","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/11906/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/11906/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/11906/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/1310d3ed1bad9e2356a320128cac125e930831dc","head":{"label":"fpompermaier:flink-17356","ref":"flink-17356","sha":"1310d3ed1bad9e2356a320128cac125e930831dc","user":{"login":"fpompermaier","id":3776037,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NzYwMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3776037?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpompermaier","html_url":"https://github.com/fpompermaier","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpompermaier/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpompermaier/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpompermaier/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpompermaier/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpompermaier/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpompermaier/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpompermaier/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpompermaier/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpompermaier/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34671677,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDY3MTY3Nw==","name":"flink","full_name":"fpompermaier/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fpompermaier","id":3776037,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NzYwMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3776037?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpompermaier","html_url":"https://github.com/fpompermaier","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpompermaier/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpompermaier/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpompermaier/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpompermaier/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpompermaier/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpompermaier/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpompermaier/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpompermaier/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fpompermaier/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fpompermaier/flink","description":"Mirror

The PR might not cover all cases where NULL enters the system, entry points of NULL into the type factory should be avoided.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Don't allow a NULL type during type generalization\r\n- Generate a null literal for FLIP-65 functions\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows: `FunctionITCase`, `NullTypeTest`\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: yes\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2020-04-24T13:52:17Z","updated_at":"2020-04-30T13:45:03Z","closed_at":"2020-04-30T13:45:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fcd5d35b7b0119d7d136098cf089dcec11749e9f","assignee":{"login":"dawidwys","id":6242259,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNDIyNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6242259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys","html_url":"https://github.com/dawidwys","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"dawidwys","id":6242259,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNDIyNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6242259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys","html_url":"https://github.com/dawidwys","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1285080206,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjg1MDgwMjA2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/Planner","name":"component=TableSQL/Planner","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1289893384,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjg5ODkzMzg0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/API","name":"component=TableSQL/API","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/11904/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/11904/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/11904/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/481a31b3db0c152c5f4671b98c0e6a752d21b7ca","head":{"label":"twalthr:FLINK-17373","ref":"FLINK-17373","sha":"481a31b3db0c152c5f4671b98c0e6a752d21b7ca","user":{"login":"twalthr","id":5746567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NDY1Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5746567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr","html_url":"https://github.com/twalthr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":20658760,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY1ODc2MA==","name":"flink","full_name":"twalthr/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"twalthr","id":5746567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NDY1Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5746567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr","html_url":"https://github.com/twalthr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis ensures that function signatures are always extracted in a deterministic way. Esp. when it comes to implicit casting, a deterministic type inference is important to evaluate sequences like `f(INT) || f(BIGINT)`. Before this PR, the signatures could be mixed by data structures or JVM method listing.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Fixes a couple of bugs around ordering\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows: `InputTypeStrategyTest`, `TypeInferenceExtractionTest`\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis pull request allows to read and write serial fields\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\nFrom types spec listed in https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/datatype-numeric.html, handled serial types in  in PostgresCatalog.fromJDBCType:\r\n\r\n- _serial_, _serial2_ , _serial4_  as **INT** \r\n- _bigserial_, _serial8_ as **BIGINT**\r\n- _smallserial_ as **SMALLINT**\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\nHowever serial type is auto-incremented: you can write a value into it but if you try to autogenerate a value you get duplicate values until you find a value that is not already in use. However Flink does not keep track of the original field type so there's no way to warn the user that is not using this field correctly (he/she should use DEFAULT or not specify any value for such columns).\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): **no**\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: **no**\r\n  - The serializers: **no**\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): **no**\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: **no**\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: **no**\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? **no**\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? **not

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThe current behavior of forcing savepoints ignores max-concurrent-checkpoints limit. Which violates Unaligned Checkpoints (UC) assumption of a single concurrent barrier.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes `CheckpointCoordinator` behavior to enqueue savepoint requests instead of forcing them if the limit is reached (in UC mode). Supporting changes are to execute these requests after one of the pending checkpoints is completed and prioritize savepoints before checkpoints.\r\n\r\nI consider this as a workaround because there is already work being done in `CheckpointCoordinator` and I'd like to minimize intersections.\r\n\r\nThe proper solution would be to introduce several separate queues and a single worker thread that processes requests from these queues: savepoint requests, (periodic) checkpoint requests, and ack/nack requests (thread-safe bounded O(1) queues). That would eliminate most of the complexity with callbacks and checks.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n1. Remove periodicTriggeringSuspended. Instead, if periodic request can't be executed now is ignored.\r\n2. Check queue before executing a new request (not after).\r\n3. Execute queued request when pending checkpoint is completed (instead of resuming timer).\r\n4. Don't set CheckpointRequest.force in UC mode.\r\n5. Change requests queue to PriorityQueue to prioritize savepoints. Limit its size.\r\n6. Move all request-related decision logic into one place (and one sync block).\r\n7. For savepoints, if running in UC mode and limit is reached then enqueue request instead of forcing it\r\n8. Don't throw trigger exceptions. Currently, they are not reported to `CheckpointFailureManager` (and besides that, it would ignore them)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n - Added `CheckpointCoordinatorTest.testSavepointScheduledInUnalignedMode` to test new CheckpointCoordinator behavior (savepoints in UC mode)\r\n - Added `CheckpointRequestDeciderTest` to test decision logic in isolation\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis pull request introduct single-value format to (de)serialize message  to a single field \r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- add single-value format . Currently support bytes[], string, int, float, double,long,boolean\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (**yes** / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / **not documented**)\r\n","created_at":"2020-04-24T04:52:31Z","updated_at":"2020-11-03T16:45:11Z","closed_at":"2020-11-03T16:45:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"eba207f01fc3fb83db2c8e45e86e855228e33d08","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"wuchong","id":5378924,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNzg5MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5378924?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong","html_url":"https://github.com/wuchong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1274303759,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjc0MzAzNzU5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Formats","name":"component=Formats","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1289893384,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjg5ODkzMzg0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/API","name":"component=TableSQL/API","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/11896/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/11896/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/11896/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/653bc88992e501e753484b41fd8ec7805582cf3c","head":{"label":"hackergin:add-single-value-format","ref":"add-single-value-format","sha":"653bc88992e501e753484b41fd8ec7805582cf3c","user":{"login":"hackergin","id":24229889,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjI5ODg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24229889?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackergin","html_url":"https://github.com/hackergin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackergin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackergin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackergin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackergin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackergin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackergin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackergin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackergin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackergin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":258399408,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNTgzOTk0MDg=","name":"flink","full_name":"hackergin/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hackergin","id":24229889,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjI5ODg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24229889?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackergin","html_url":"https://github.com/hackergin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackergin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackergin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackergin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackergin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackergin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackergin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackergin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackergin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hackergin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hackergin/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not

What is the purpose of the change\r\nFLINK-14688 introduces DESCRIBE statement in sql parser, but doesn't implement it in planner side because the TableEnvironment.sqlUpdate returns nothing. Since FLINK-16366 introduces TableEnvironment.executeSql and returns TableResult, we can implement DESCRIBE statement in planner now.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n- 84b4681 supports DESCRIBE statement in both planners\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nadd a Test for issue [FLINK-16662], Blink Planner classloader load user class when create job graph\r\n1. provide a blink planner program using customer pojo (or udf) with test jar\r\n2. generate job graph \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - add a test program & test case in module flink-table-planner-blink module\r\n  - add assembly plugin for generating test jar, maven-clean-plugin for clean test class\r\n  - add assembly file\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nexecute test in BlinkProgramCodegenClassloaderTest\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no, only maven plugin)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nadd a Test for issue [FLINK-16662], Blink Planner classloader load user class when create job graph\r\n1. provide a blink planner program using customer pojo (or udf) with test jar\r\n2. generate job graph \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - add a test program & test case in module flink-table-planner-blink module\r\n  - add assembly plugin for generating test jar, maven-clean-plugin for clean test class\r\n  - add assembly file\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nexecute test in BlinkProgramCodegenClassloaderTest\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no, only maven plugin)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2020-04-23T17:48:43Z","updated_at":"2020-05-08T13:54:14Z","closed_at":"2020-05-08T13:53:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2b38f96517fa5a4e07baeefe2f9e996aad281b23","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1285080206,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjg1MDgwMjA2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/Planner","name":"component=TableSQL/Planner","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1536123478,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTM2MTIzNDc4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Client/JobSubmission","name":"component=Client/JobSubmission","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/11889/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/11889/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/11889/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/a0a3fd92c804a1fd057f046262c74a6b0a005015","head":{"label":"chenxyz707:release-1.10","ref":"release-1.10","sha":"a0a3fd92c804a1fd057f046262c74a6b0a005015","user":{"login":"chenxyz707","id":12759277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzU5Mjc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12759277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenxyz707","html_url":"https://github.com/chenxyz707","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenxyz707/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenxyz707/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenxyz707/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenxyz707/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenxyz707/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenxyz707/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenxyz707/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenxyz707/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenxyz707/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:release-1.10","ref":"release-1.10","sha":"7a87aa415ef7a3cf6d2845e0e9fe5f4b8234503f","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":20587599,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDU4NzU5OQ==","name":"flink","full_name":"apache/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nadd a Test for issue [FLINK-16662], Blink Planner classloader load user class when create job graph\r\n1. provide a blink planner program using customer pojo (or udf) with test jar\r\n2. generate job graph \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - add a test program & test case in module flink-table-planner-blink module\r\n  - add assembly plugin for generating test jar, maven-clean-plugin for clean test class\r\n  - add assembly file\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nexecute test in BlinkProgramCodegenClassloaderTest\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no, only maven plugin)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2020-04-23T17:36:24Z","updated_at":"2020-04-23T18:06:21Z","closed_at":"2020-04-23T17:38:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1285080206,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjg1MDgwMjA2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/Planner","name":"component=TableSQL/Planner","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1536123478,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTM2MTIzNDc4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Client/JobSubmission","name":"component=Client/JobSubmission","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/11888/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/11888/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/11888/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/7a87aa415ef7a3cf6d2845e0e9fe5f4b8234503f","head":{"label":"apache:release-1.10","ref":"release-1.10","sha":"7a87aa415ef7a3cf6d2845e0e9fe5f4b8234503f","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":20587599,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDU4NzU5OQ==","name":"flink","full_name":"apache/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nDeprecate key based methods that do not use KeySelector in Datastreams API \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\njavadoc update + deprecate annotation for Datastream.keyBy and Datastream.partitionCustom methods\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): ( no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no). Only on a class annotated @Public\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis is the second ingredient besides FLINK-16404 to solve the deadlock problem without exclusive buffers.\r\n\r\nThe scenario is as follows:\r\n\r\nThe data in subpartition with positive backlog can be sent without doubt because the exclusive credits would be feedback finally.\r\nWithout exclusive buffers, the receiver would not request floating buffers for 0 backlog. But when the new backlog is added into such subpartition, it has no way to notify the receiver side without positive credits ATM.\r\nSo it would result in waiting for each other between receiver and sender sides to cause deadlock. The sender waits for credit to notify backlog and the receiver waits for backlog to request floating credits.\r\nTo solve the above problem, the sender needs a separate message to announce backlog sometimes besides existing `BufferResponse`. Then the receiver can get this info to request floating buffers to feedback.\r\n\r\nIn the current implementation, the upstream task will announce backlog to the downstream task and the downstream task will allocate buffers (credit) to receive data from upstream. This PR enhances the current implementation in three main aspects:\r\n1. If there is no initial credit, the upstream producer task will announce the available backlog to the downstream consumer task when available data is notified.\r\n2. The downstream consumer task will release all allocated buffers (credit) on receiving the aligned checkpoint barrier. Besides, it will never allocate any credit before checkpoint completion.\r\n3. For empty buffers of upstream task, instead of released directly, they will be sent to the downstream task to release the buffers (credit) allocated for these empty buffers.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - If there is no initial credit, the upstream producer task will announce the available backlog to the downstream consumer task when available data is notified.\r\n  - The downstream consumer task will release all allocated buffers (credit) on receiving the aligned checkpoint barrier.

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Now that we load the Datadog reporters as plugins we should remove the shade-plugin configuration/relocations.*\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2020-04-23T05:08:55Z","updated_at":"2020-04-23T10:09:15Z","closed_at":"2020-04-23T10:09:15Z","merged_at":"2020-04-23T10:09:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"8066160a08a9cddc366ca28a4ed82d3221669d4f","assignee":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273342730,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMzQyNzMw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Metrics","name":"component=Runtime/Metrics","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/11872/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/11872/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/11872/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/6ee34138baa74abb4b7c1f71ea98e360340a2b8c","head":{"label":"molsionmo:FLINK-17227","ref":"FLINK-17227","sha":"6ee34138baa74abb4b7c1f71ea98e360340a2b8c","user":{"login":"molsionmo","id":52347588,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMzQ3NTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52347588?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/molsionmo","html_url":"https://github.com/molsionmo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/molsionmo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/molsionmo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/molsionmo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/molsionmo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/molsionmo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/molsionmo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/molsionmo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/molsionmo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/molsionmo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"aa489269a1429f25136765af94b05d10ef5b7fd3","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_even

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18002496/80060767-f1024080-8561-11ea-9dcb-8925001577c1.png)\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis method `generateOneInputStreamOperator` when OperatorCodeGenerator  generates SourceConversion:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@Override\r\npublic void processElement($STREAM_RECORD $ELEMENT) throws Exception {\r\n  $inputTypeTerm $inputTerm = ($inputTypeTerm) ${converter(s\"$ELEMENT.getValue()\")};\r\n  ${ctx.reusePerRecordCode()}\r\n  ${ctx.reuseLocalVariableCode()}\r\n  ${if (lazyInputUnboxingCode) \"\" else ctx.reuseInputUnboxingCode()}\r\n  $processCode\r\n}\r\n \r\n\r\n $inputTypeTerm $inputTerm = ($inputTypeTerm) ${converter(s\"$ELEMENT.getValue()\")};\r\nScanUtil calls generateOneInputStreamOperator\r\n\r\n\r\nval generatedOperator = OperatorCodeGenerator.generateOneInputStreamOperator[Any, BaseRow](\r\n  ctx,\r\n  convertName,\r\n  processCode,\r\n  outputRowType,\r\n  converter = inputTermConverter)\r\n\r\n//inputTermConverter\r\nval (inputTermConverter, inputRowType) = {\r\n  val convertFunc = CodeGenUtils.genToInternal(ctx, inputType)\r\n  internalInType match {\r\n    case rt: RowType => (convertFunc, rt)\r\n    case _ => ((record: String) => s\"$GENERIC_ROW.of(${convertFunc(record)})\",\r\n        RowType.of(internalInType))\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThere is an useless cast class code:\r\n```\r\n$inputTypeTerm $inputTerm = ($inputTypeTerm) ${converter(s\"$ELEMENT.getValue()\")};\r\n```\r\nCodeGenUtils.scala  :  genToInternal\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef genToInternal(ctx: CodeGeneratorContext, t: DataType): String => String = {\r\n  val iTerm = boxedTypeTermForType(fromDataTypeToLogicalType(t))\r\n  if (isConverterIdentity(t)) {\r\n    term => s\"($iTerm) $term\"\r\n  } else {\r\n    val eTerm = boxedTypeTermForExternalType(t)\r\n    val converter = ctx.addReusableObject(\r\n      DataFormatConverters.getConverterForDataType(t),\r\n      \"converter\")\r\n    term => s\"($iTerm) $converter.toInternal(($eTerm) $term)\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n \r\nThe code `($iTerm) ` and `($inputTypeTerm)` are same.\r\n\r\nThis method `genToInternal ` is used elsewhere, so the `($iTerm)` code can't be delete.\r\nFor the following code example : ([detail address |https://travis-ci.com/github/flink-ci/flink/jobs/322393094])\r\n```\r\nresult$224 = javaResult$225 == null ? null : ((x x x x )converter$226.toInternal((java.lang.String) javaResult$225));  \r\n```\r\nSo I used converter parameter\r\n\r\n\r\n# Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n# Does this pull request potentially

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFLINK-17106 introduces create/drop view in Flink SQL. But we can't list views from TableEnvironment or SQL. This PR supports SHOW VIEWS in Flink SQL.

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nTo harden unaligned checkpoints as quickly as possible, we want to enable it by default for all tests similarly how we did it for credit-based flow control network stack.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Checking system property \"execution.checkpointing.unaligned\" if no explicit configuration option has been used.\r\n- Setting system property \"execution.checkpointing.unaligned\"=\"true\" for maven surefire for all unit and IT tests.\r\n- Setting the configuration \"execution.checkpointing.unaligned\"=\"true\" for all e2e tests.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAffects only tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (**not applicable** / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2020-04-22T19:20:02Z","updated_at":"2020-06-22T17:08:58Z","closed_at":"2020-06-22T17:08:58Z","merged_at":"2020-06-22T17:08:58Z","merge_commit_sha":"d735d8cd8e5d9fae5322001099097581822453ae","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273164140,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMTY0MTQw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Tests","name":"component=Tests","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/11868/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/11868/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/11868/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/5b05578dd320dc32441ec1c374c99f94d0c1e0c9","head":{"label":"AHeise:FLINK-17258","ref":"FLINK-17258","sha":"5b05578dd320dc32441ec1c374c99f94d0c1e0c9","user":{"login":"AHeise","id":4559103,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NTkxMDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4559103?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise","html_url":"https://github.com/AHeise","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"0dec10ecaaa8a463768866ebde58e38efbc2a612","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":20587599,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDU4NzU5OQ==","name":"flink","full_name":"apache/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR sets the `BIND_HOST` to `localhost` in `TaskManagerRunnerStartupTest` in order to make the test fail again when instantiating the `NettyShuffleEnvironment`. Moreover, it changes the test to use a proper `AkkaRpcService` instead of a mock in order to not hide the true failure cause under some NPE.\r\n\r\nThis PR is based on #11865 a revert for FLINK-14499, which is simply wrong and needs to be reverted.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nIt looks like we never respected memory configuration in Mesos JM startup scripts:\r\n- `mesos-appmaster.sh`\r\n- `mesos-appmaster-job.sh`\r\n\r\nThis adopts FLIP-116 here as well, similar to what we are doing with standalone scripts in #11545.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - deduplicate code in `mesos-appmaster(-job).sh` into `mesos-jobmanager.sh`\r\n  - add JVM memory args to mesos JM start command in `mesos-jobmanager.sh`\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nUnit, Jepsen and e2e tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`:

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nChannelStateReader expects requests only for channels or subpartitions that have state.  \r\nIn case of upscaling or starting from scratch this behavior is incorrect. \r\nIt should return NO_MORE_DATA.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n`ChannelStateReaderImplTest` was changed accordingly to cover this case.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing,

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR tries to fix the issue caused by not stopping waiting on the buffer provider when the required buffers are fulfilled when recycling the exclusive buffers. If we do not stop waiting, we could not reuse the floating buffers returned when recycling the exclusive buffers. \r\n\r\nSpecial care needs to taken that there might be case that the listener has been picked out from the buffer pool for notifying of new buffer when the input channel is adding exclusive buffer. In this case, the listener would not actually removed from the provider and we could not reset the waiting flag, otherwise the listener might be added twice in the buffer provider.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- fa6a9de78920441c0b562e936b8a438776ab4bbe removes the listener when the when exclusive buffer fulfills the required buffers.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n- Add UT to verify the waiting is stopped as expected.\r\n- The failure in [FLINK-17182](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-17182) does not occurs when running that UT repeatedly. \r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): **no**\r\n  - The

What is the purpose of the change\r\nThis patch fixes a bug that when `SplitFetcher.wakeup()` is invoked, the fetcher thread may be interrupted and thus lose the record.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n1. Fix the wakeup handling in `SplitFetcher`\r\n2. Added unit tests for wakeup correctness.\r\n3. Fixed a bug in `MockSplitReader` to handle interruptions.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAdded unit test `SplitFetcherTest` for the correctness of wakeup. The tests keeps waking up a fetcher thread to ensure the result delivered by the fetcher thread is still in order without duplication.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nIntroduce external resource framework\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- 6edb419: Introduce interfaces for external resource framework\r\n- 92e6fe1: Introduce config options and constants for external resource framework\r\n- 0cdf6f1: Add utility class, which include helper functions for external resource framework\r\n- c820a6e: Forward extended resource request to YARN. Try to add it as `ResourceInformation`.\r\n- 7b726bc: Forward extended resource request to Kubernetes. Add the request to TM pod.\r\n- 495ac34: Add extended resource drivers to TaskExecutor.\r\n- 40801ca: Enable operator and function to get the information of external resource from RuntimeContext\r\n- 6f27933: Enable operator and function to get the information of external resource from FunctionContext\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAdd relevant UT test.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: yes\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? yes\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? configuration doc.\r\n","created_at":"2020-04-22T06:30:41Z","updated_at":"2021-02-26T08:07:47Z","closed_at":"2020-05-17T15:38:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"baa47fb5d921e8856aba7934dd4ffc18e99a5709","assignee":{"login":"tillrohrmann","id":5756858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTY4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5756858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann","html_url":"https://github.com/tillrohrmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"tillrohrmann","id":5756858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTY4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5756858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann","html_url":"https://github.com/tillrohrmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1272994322,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MzIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Coordination","name":"component=Runtime/Coordination","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273025819,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMDI1ODE5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Configuration","name":"component=Runtime/Configuration","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1401080710,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDAxMDgwNzEw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Task","name":"component=Runtime/Task","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/11854/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/11854/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/11854/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/d255903bbe5da86d53547ad6a3d5ddf02e63b913","head":{"label":"KarmaGYZ:introduce-external-resource-framework","ref":"introduce-external-resource-framework","sha":"d255903bbe5da86d53547ad6a3d5ddf02e63b913","user":{"login":"KarmaGYZ","id":8684799,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2ODQ3OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8684799?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ","html_url":"https://github.com/KarmaGYZ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":159165742,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTkxNjU3NDI=","name":"flink","full_name":"KarmaGYZ/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"KarmaGYZ","id":8684799,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2ODQ3OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8684799?v=4","gravatar_id":"

AllocationID\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nLog the lineage information between ExecutionAttemptID and AllocationID\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nLog the lineage information between ExecutionAttemptID and AllocationID\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2020-04-22T06:16:24Z","updated_at":"2022-03-17T15:37:28Z","closed_at":"2020-06-25T07:38:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ea17118c1bca38cb1530255fff9ee4583b79e5bf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1272994322,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MzIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Coordination","name":"component=Runtime/Coordination","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/11852/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/11852/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/11852/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/441511309e2cc424afce31b9e8ecdfd64f21a135","head":{"label":"KarmaGYZ:FLINK-17300","ref":"FLINK-17300","sha":"441511309e2cc424afce31b9e8ecdfd64f21a135","user":{"login":"KarmaGYZ","id":8684799,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2ODQ3OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8684799?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ","html_url":"https://github.com/KarmaGYZ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":159165742,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTkxNjU3NDI=","name":"flink","full_name":"KarmaGYZ/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"KarmaGYZ","id":8684799,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2ODQ3OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8684799?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ","html_url":"https://github.com/KarmaGYZ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/KarmaGYZ/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nSupport sql client insert job start from a savepoint.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n\r\n  - *The SQL Client document about execution*\r\n  - *Add optional savepoint path config in `org.apache.flink.table.client.config.entries.ExecutionEntry`*\r\n  - *Add Configuration when SQL update in `org.apache.flink.table.client.gateway.local.LocalExecutor`*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change not added tests \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n* Now TypeMappingUtils#checkPhysicalLogicalTypeCompatible method doesn't consider the different physical and logical type validation logic of source and sink: logical type should be able to cover the physical type in source, but physical type should be able to cover the logic type in sink vice verse. Besides, the decimal type should be taken more carefully, when target type is Legacy(Decimal), it should be able to accept any precision decimal type.*\r\n* This pr aims to solve the above problem.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - 9b24a40 correct the validation logc\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no )\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n\r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*This pull request fix typo error that should be `TPC` rather than `TCP`.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *update file TpcdsTestProgram.java and RelationalQueryCompilerTest.java*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): ( no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\nCurrently, we when use `flink-console.sh` to start jobmanager/taskmanager start-foreground, the logs could not be accessed via webui. Just because we do not output the logs to the files.\r\n\r\nIn docker container environment, using `docker logs` to view the logs is a common way. So still need to output the logs to console.\r\n\r\nWe will add a `RollingFileAppender` to also output the logs to a local file so that the logs could be accessed via web dashboard.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* Update `log4j-console.properties` and `logback-console.xml` to output logs to files\r\n* Update `flink-console.sh`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n* Current all e2e tests should not be affected\r\n* Manually test logging/stdout/stderr could output to console and file at same time\r\n  * `./bin/jobmanager.sh start-foreground`\r\n  * `./bin/taskmanager.sh start-foreground`\r\n  * View localhost:8081 to check the logs could be accessed via webui\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (**not applicable** / docs / JavaDocs / not

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes.

for TableEnvironment.connect().createTemporaryTable()\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\nSince FLINK-14490, proctime()/rowtime() doesn't work  for TableEnvironment.connect().createTemporaryTable(), The root cause is:\r\n- proctime()/rowtime() are used along with DefinedRowtimeAttributes/DefinedProctimeAttribute and ConnectorCatalogTable.  The original code path stores the ConnectorCatalogTable object in Catalog and in validate phrase, the RowType is derived from ConnectorCatalogTable.getSchema which contains time indicator. After FLINK-14490, we store CatalogTableImpl object in Catalog and in validate phrase, the RowType is derived from CatalogTableImpl.getSchema which doesn't contain time indicator.\r\n- In SqlToRel phrase, FlinkCalciteCatalogReader converts ConnectorCatalogTable to TableSourceTable and converts CatalogTable to CatalogSourceTable. The TableSourceTable would be converted to LogicalTableScan directly and contains time indicator. Otherwise the CatalogSourceTable would be converted to a LogicalTableScan whose time indicator is erased(by FLINK-16345).\r\nThis PR fix it.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n- instantiate the TableSource in CatalogSchemaTable and check if it's a DefinedRowtimeAttributes/DefinedProctimeAttribute instance. If so, rewrite the TableSchema to patch the time indicator(as it is in ConnectorCatalogTable#calculateSourceSchema)\r\n- Avoid erasing time indicator in CatalogSourceTable if the TableSource is a DefinedRowtimeAttributes/DefinedProctimeAttribute instance\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n\r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*This pull request fix the icu license, move the icu being under the ICU license block in notice file.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *update file flink/flink-table/flink-table-planner-blink/src/main/resources/META-INF/NOTICE*\r\n  - *update file flink/flink-table/flink-table-planner/src/main/resources/META-INF/NOTICE*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a hotfix for docs without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): ( no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nBefore this change, HA tests were waiting indefinitely for certain conditions to be met.\r\nThis change introduces a timeout (10 minutes) in the test scripts that kills the test and prints the Flink logs for debugging.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Change the HA watchdogs to store their state in files rather than variables (so that different bash processes can access them)\r\n- launch HA test and a watchdog that sleeps for 10 minutes. If the test doesn't finish in 10, the watchdog will kill the test.\r\n","created_at":"2020-04-20T14:32:12Z","updated_at":"2020-04-29T13:18:27Z","closed_at":"2020-04-29T13:18:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7fc1a5db2774d951edfcb1a3a482f0a3f6ab93a1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273164140,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMTY0MTQw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Tests","name":"component=Tests","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273376312,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMzc2MzEy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Checkpointing","name":"component=Runtime/Checkpointing","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/11831/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/11831/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/11831/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/a791d09c9e7e494f6f6b177564d83e35a7d03148","head":{"label":"rmetzger:FLINK-16423-ha-e2e-timeout-pr","ref":"FLINK-16423-ha-e2e-timeout-pr","sha":"a791d09c9e7e494f6f6b177564d83e35a7d03148","user":{"login":"rmetzger","id":89049,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger","html_url":"https://github.com/rmetzger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":20618957,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDYxODk1Nw==","name":"flink","full_name":"rmetzger/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rmetzger","id":89049,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger","html_url":"https://github.com/rmetzger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmetzger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rmetzger/flink","description":"Mirror

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?
