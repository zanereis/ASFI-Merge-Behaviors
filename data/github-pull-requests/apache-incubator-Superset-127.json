CATEGORY\r\n\r\nChoose one\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bug Fix\r\n- [X] Enhancement (new features, refinement)\r\n- [ ] Refactor\r\n- [ ] Add tests\r\n- [ ] Build / Development Environment\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nWhen quering the examples table `wb_health_population` on SQLLab including all the columns on the statement:\r\n\r\n``` sql\r\nSELECT \"NY_GNP_PCAP_CD\",\r\n       \"SE_ADT_1524_LT_FM_ZS\",\r\n       \"SE_ADT_1524_LT_MA_ZS\",\r\n       \"SE_ADT_1524_LT_ZS\",\r\n       \"SE_ADT_LITR_FE_ZS\",\r\n  ... (8551 characters truncated) ... _IN_ZS\",\r\n       \"SP_UWT_TFRT\",\r\n       country_code,\r\n       country_name,\r\n       region,\r\n       year\r\nFROM public.wb_health_population\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe query would take approximately 50s to 70s to complete, yet the query itself only takes 10-20ms to execute. This is due to `ParsedQuery.__extract_from_token` function that extracts all the tables from a query, noticed that the property `tables` itself is seldom used/needed. This is a simple fix, that reduces the time to execute from 50s-70s to 10s-20s so 1/6 of the total time.\r\n\r\nExpected, since sql_json execution path instantiates ParsedQuery 6 times.\r\n\r\nSimple fix, but the `__extract_from_token` recursive loop should be visited and improved (@lilykuang).\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Requires DB Migration.\r\n- [ ] Confirm DB Migration upgrade and downgrade tested.\r\n- [ ] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or API\r\n\r\n### REVIEWERS\r\n@robdiciuccio

CATEGORY\r\n\r\n- [x] Bug Fix\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/9562 adds number formatters for original value and integers. This PR changes number formatter for original value from `\" \"` (a space character) to `~g` (decimal or exponential notation without trailing zeros). The original formatter `\" \"` is a valid d3 format and does return the original value as expected, but cannot be used as a registry key for `superset-ui/number-format`. \r\n\r\nThis is because the registry [automatically trims the registry key][1] while creating a formatter, but when obtaining a formatter it [returns `undefined` for an empty string `\"\"`][2]. \r\n\r\nThis is problematic when users changes the formatters back and forth in Explore view, resulting in JS errors.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/335541/79946402-c2cb1680-8424-11ea-86a9-81dad8963f91.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui/blob/44ad062dd02d080362dac28782c0327cc9fa3445/packages/superset-ui-number-format/src/NumberFormatterRegistry.ts#L30\r\n[2]: https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui/blob/dc804b7a707e0cb8c29fc129bfff2c9aa143fd62/packages/superset-ui-core/src/models/RegistryWithDefaultKey.ts#L36\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\n1. Go to line chart\r\n2. Change number formatters back and forth between \"Original value\" and others\r\n3. It shouldn't throw JS errors when you hover on the chart for tooltips.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nSeveral small changes to chart data API/schema, `QueryContext`/`QueryObject`:\r\n- Add query context related fixtures. Might seem overkill for now, but I intend to add more fixtures as we roll out the API to chart plugins.\r\n- Move query context tests from `core_tests.py` to new `query_context_tests.py` (more to come)\r\n- Change enums in chart api Marshmallow specs from `enum` to `validate=validate.OneOf()` to add validation (`enum` wasn't validating values) while still retaining `enum` in OpenAPI spec.\r\n\r\nRelated ticket: #9187 \r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nCI + local testing\r\n\r\n### REVIEWERS\r\n@dpgaspar

It doesn't need to be part of the regular lint check as it delays running eslint and makes passing flags more complicated. However it does need to run on CI to ensure no unformatted css files slip through (eslint isn't checking style files). \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes an issue where the Jinja `filter_values` was only adhering to legacy filter constructs (which are still used by the filter box) and thus a query could differ whether executed from a dashboard or from the explorer where the filters are inherited (though in the form of ad-hoc filters). \r\n\r\nThe fix is merely to convert the legacy filters to ad-hoc and and merge the extra filters inline with other portions of the code.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TEST

and changed the response payload to include the status/error. Previously the method would short circuit if an exception was thrown (resulting in a 500) however it wasn't evident which slice failed to be warmed nor would it try to warm and remaining slices.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\nTested locally and error errors were being propagated for failed queries. \r\n\r\n```\r\n[\r\n    {\r\n        \"slice_id\": 1, \r\n        \"viz_error\": \"presto

In order to accomplish this, we need to configure the required merge checks properly for the repo as to gate merges properly. If not all CI results are required, it's possible that a failing check could slip through. If not all workflows are run for each PR, then we can't REQUIRE those which run

#9490 after some major refactoring.\r\n\r\n### CATEGORY\r\n\r\n- [x] Build / Development Environment\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nAdding GitHub Actions per discussion in #9481 . This is a pure addition to the current build process for now. Nothing changed for Travis CI, except Cypress was upgraded from `3.6.1` to `4.3.0`. We could evaluate whether to disable Travis CI once these GitHub Actions become more stable. \r\n\r\nJobs are split into 4 workflows to maximize parallelization:\r\n\r\n- **superset-backend.yml:** python lint and unit tests\r\n- **superset-frontend.yml:** frontend lint and unit tests\r\n- **superset-e2e.yml:** end to end tests with Cypress\r\n- **license-check.yml:** check license compatibility\r\n\r\nA custom [GitHub Action](https://github.com/ktmud/cached-dependencies) was created to generalize the building steps related to caching and dependencies. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nOnce successfully integrated, GitHub PRs should have checks like below:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/335541/79062679-2ef19180-7c51-11ea-9c45-4b85519ae6dc.png)\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, use https://github.com/ktmud/incubator-superset/pull/27 to see these checks in action.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\nMake sure CI passes.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### REVIEWERS\r\n\r\n@john-bodley @dpgaspar @craig-rueda @villebro

#9490 after some major refactoring.\r\n\r\n### CATEGORY\r\n\r\n- [x] Build / Development Environment\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nAdding GitHub Actions per discussion in #9481 . This is a pure addition to the current build process for now. Nothing changed for Travis CI, except Cypress was upgraded from `3.6.1` to `4.3.0`. We could evaluate whether to disable Travis CI once these GitHub Actions become more stable. \r\n\r\nJobs are split into 4 workflows to maximize parallelization:\r\n\r\n- **superset-backend.yml:** python lint and unit tests\r\n- **superset-frontend.yml:** frontend lint and unit tests\r\n- **superset-e2e.yml:** end to end tests with Cypress\r\n- **license-check.yml:** check license compatibility\r\n\r\nA custom [GitHub Action](https://github.com/ktmud/cached-dependencies) was created to generalize the building steps related to caching and dependencies. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nOnce successfully integrated, GitHub PRs should have checks like below:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/335541/79062679-2ef19180-7c51-11ea-9c45-4b85519ae6dc.png)\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, use https://github.com/ktmud/incubator-superset/pull/27 to see these checks in action.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\nMake sure CI passes.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### REVIEWERS\r\n\r\n@john-bodley @dpgaspar @craig-rueda @villebro

This is a pure addition to the current build process for now. Nothing changed for Travis CI, except Cypress was upgraded from `3.6.1` to `4.3.0`. We could evaluate whether to disable Travis CI once these GitHub Actions become more stable. \r\n\r\nJobs are split into 4 workflows to maximize parallelization:\r\n\r\n- **superset-backend.yml:** python lint and unit tests\r\n- **superset-frontend.yml:** frontend lint and unit tests\r\n- **superset-e2e.yml:** end to end tests with Cypress\r\n- **license-check.yml:** check license compatibility\r\n\r\nA custom [GitHub Action](https://github.com/ktmud/cached-dependencies) was created to generalize the building steps related to caching and dependencies. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nOnce successfully integrated, GitHub PRs should have checks like

CATEGORY\r\n\r\nChoose one\r\n\r\n- [X] Bug Fix\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (new features, refinement)\r\n- [ ] Refactor\r\n- [ ] Add tests\r\n- [ ] Build / Development Environment\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThere are several related issues in the import_dashboards\r\n1) The current code check if the imported dashboard is existing dashboard by comparing current dash's remote_id with imported_dashboard.id. But the imported_dashboard.id is always None. You can check the export_dashboards code and resulting json dump file.  The result is that every dashboard imported is new dashboards.\r\nChange the code to compare remote_ids on both dashboard will partially this issue. \r\n\r\n2) In cases of multiple superset instances, and each instance with its own database. For example, production and sandbox deployment. User develop on sandbox and publish to production instance using export/import_dashboards.  In such scenario, even the two dashboards contents are the same, the remote_ids could be different.  The result will be same as No. 1 issue, where imported dashboard is treated as new one instead of updated one. \r\n\r\nThe proposed fix is to change the test for existing dashboard condition as follows: \r\n\r\n      \"remote_id\" in dash.params_dict and \r\n( dash.params_dict[\"remote_id\"] == dashboard_to_import.params_dict[\"remote_id\"]\r\n                      or dash.dashboard_title == dashboard_to_import.dashboard_title )\r\ninstead \r\n              \"remote_id\" in dash.params_dict\r\n                and  dash.params_dict[\"remote_id\"] == dashboard_to_import.id\r\n\r\n  * If the remote_ids are the same, one can use it to update dashboards including update title\r\n  * if the remote_ids are different,  but the titles are the same, we can update dashboards, address the issue of database migration\r\n  * if both remote_ids and titles are different, then we treat the imported dashboard as new one. \r\n\r\n Status: \r\n    I have tested the changes in 0.34 release, where the code is still in core.py.  Notice the latest versions only move the functions from core.py to dashboard.py, but no actually code changes. the same code should work for the new versions. \r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\n   Base test : \r\n     Before the code change:\r\n     select and export a dashboard; then import the dashboard with the json file. \r\n    you will see the new dashboard with same title created, instead updated. \r\n     import multiple times, you will see each import creates a new dashboard\r\n\r\n   Test case 1: \r\n     after the code change:\r\n     select and export a dashboard; then import the dashboard with the json file. \r\n     you only see one dashboard with the same title\r\n\r\n   Test Case 2:\r\n      after the code change: \r\n      use the same test case 1, except manually change the tile of dashboard in the json file, then import dashboard, you should seen the dashboard title changed to the new one\r\n   Test Case 3\r\n     after the code change:\r\n    Follow the test chase 1, except change the remote_id in the json file (simulate the dashboard from another database). Import the dashboard again, you should see the updated dashboard with (only one) with same title. \r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT:

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/9440 unintentionally moved the \"Options\" section for Big Number chart to the \"Customize\" tab.\r\n\r\nThis is because [ControlPanelsContainer](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/blob/06c4795fba48ed64e54e74eb8eb2f5a202c01fc8/superset-frontend/src/explore/components/ControlPanelsContainer.jsx#L203) checks whether a section needs to display in the Data tab by checking whether any of the control in that section must trigger new queries when updated (`renderTrigger: false`) or has `tabOverride = data`. But it uses the config in the shared controls file, and assumes the control configs passed along are names of the shared controls, and could be used to look up the shared control from [controls.jsx](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/blob/b6bca9f137b069716938ac1df5862c0b5d2c3461/superset-frontend/src/explore/controls.jsx#L1158). However, when these controls are refactored into custom configs, they become objects and `ControlPanelsContainer` then fails to find the shared control, hence the `renderTrigger` and `tabOverride` info.\r\n\r\nIdeally this `tabOverride` option should probably be at the section level. \r\n\r\nA bigger refactor is need to let `ControlPanelsContainer` always read from parsed control configs (instead of the control keys). This PR is just a quick fix.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n#### Before\r\n\r\nThe \"Options\" section is displayed in the \"Customize\"

CATEGORY\r\n\r\n- [x] Build / Development Environment\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nAdding GitHub Actions per discussion in https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/issues/9481. It is a pure addition to current build process for now. Nothing changes for Travis CI, except Cypress is upgraded from `3.6.1` to `4.3.0`.\r\n\r\nWe may evaluate whether to disable Travis CI once GitHub Actions become more stable. \r\n\r\nJobs are split into 3 workflows to maximize parallelization:\r\n\r\n- **superset-python.yml:** python lint and unit tests\r\n- **superset-frontend.yml:** frontend lint and unit tests\r\n- **superset-e2e.yml:** end to end tests with Cypress\r\n\r\nA custom GitHub Action was created to generalize some of the building steps, but not all of them. There are duplicate code about cache across files, while could potentially be lifted into the GitHub Action like [the official Cypress GitHub action](\r\nhttps://github.com/cypress-io/github-action/blob/d81aef503fcd11db601c9f79ca30d3353dcc46e9/index.js#L8).\r\n\r\n#### Some thoughts\r\n\r\nGitHub Actions is less powerful than some other CI/CD tools, e.g., CircleCI and GitLab CI/CD, but overall it was a pleasant experience to use. Two major nuances are: 1. limited parallelization support, cannot organize jobs as DAGs; 2. cannot automatically cancel current jobs on new pushes.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

clicking on \"Explore\" button in SQL Lab results, it defaults the time range to \"100 years ago : infinity\", which is basically equivalent to no filter for most datasources. However, it has implication on how the x-axis will be plotted in certain charts (e.g., recently, the Big Number chart introduced a[ fixed range](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/9341) option).\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the default to \"No filter\" so the time range filter can be more properly utilized. \r\n\r\nThere is also a global default value \"[Last week](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/blob/893c95521b8147cce85eafade9f718867990ff75/superset-frontend/src/explore/controls.jsx#L846)\", which is applied when users create a new chart from `/chart/add`. We are not changing this default value in this PR.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nWhen clicking on Explore in SQL Lab:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/335541/78172759-75eab600-740b-11ea-840a-1e2389b6c925.png)\r\n\r\n#### Before\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/335541/78172730-69665d80-740b-11ea-924d-ee7bcec67b7d.png)\r\n\r\n#### After\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/335541/78172938-c4985000-740b-11ea-96c3-d13e69c14d94.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\n1.

SUMMARY\r\nRegression when updating a dashboard the dashboard's charts owners are not updated.\r\nWhen changing the dashboard owners we expect that all the charts that belong to the dashboard to be updated with the same dashboard owners (and preserve their own also)\r\n\r\nNote: Will add tests to cover this regression\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n- Login with `admin`\r\n- Create 2 users `gamma` and `alpha`\r\n- Update a dashboard setting it's new owners with `gamma` and `alpha`\r\n- Check that all the charts that belong to the dashboard get it's owners updated with `gamma`, `alpha` and `admin`\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Requires DB Migration.\r\n- [ ] Confirm DB Migration upgrade and downgrade tested.\r\n- [ ]
