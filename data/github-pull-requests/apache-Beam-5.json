aggregate a collection of string sequences (FQNs) with a limited size.\r\n\r\n**It is recommended to review this PR by commits.** \r\n\r\nBoundedTrie is a space-saving way to store many string sequences (like FQN/file paths). It acts like a tree with branches, holding sequences within a size limit. It can efficiently add, combine, and search and perform trimming of children when the size increases beyond defined max.\r\n\r\nLet's say we want to store these sequences, with a size limit of 3:\r\n\r\n\"folder1/file1.txt\"\r\n\"folder1/file2.txt\"\r\n\"folder2/file3.txt\"\r\nHere's how the BoundedTrie might look:\r\n```\r\nroot\r\n  - folder1\r\n     - file1.txt\r\n     - file2.txt\r\n  - folder2\r\n     - file3.txt \r\n```\r\nIf we try to add \"folder1/file4.txt\", the trie might trim to \"folder1\", dropping all children to stay within the size limit.\r\n\r\nThis will be used to replace the StringSet metric for lineage tracking for very large lineage graphs to overcome the size limits.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

decompressive transcoding occurs, the size returned from metadata (i.e. the gzipped file size) does not match the size of the content returned (i.e. original data size). This causes data loss problem. <s>In this case, we force the source to be unsplittable to ensure all its content is read.</s>\r\n\r\nTo address this, we leverage the GCS client library's ability to retrieve raw data, even when the object meets the criteria for decompressive transcoding. By setting raw_download=True when initializing the BlobReader, we ensure the complete data is retrieved\r\n\r\nThis change should not impact performance. The GCS client library already retrieves raw data from GCS and performs any necessary decompression client-side, mimicking the effects of server-side decompressive transcoding. Therefore, the decompression workload always occurs on the client side, which is consistent both before and after the fix.\r\n\r\nfixes #18390\r\nfixes #31040\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

<code>manifests</code> option enabled now preserves the original order in which manifests appeared in the manifest-index. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/moby/moby/pull/48712\">moby/moby#48712</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Bug fixes and enhancements</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>When reading logs with the <code>jsonfile</code> or <code>local</code> log drivers, any errors while trying to read or parse underlying log files will cause the rest of the file to be skipped and move to the next log file (if one exists) rather than returning an error to the client and closing the stream.

href=\"https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/releases\">google.golang.org/grpc's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Release 1.69.0</h2>\n<h1>Known Issues</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>The recently added <code>grpc.NewClient</code> function is incompatible with forward proxies, because it resolves the target hostname on the client instead of passing the hostname to the proxy. A fix is expected to be a part of grpc-go v1.70. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/7556\">#7556</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>New Features</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>stats/opentelemetry: Introduce new APIs to enable OpenTelemetry instrumentation for metrics on servers and clients (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/7874\">#7874</a>)</li>\n<li>xdsclient: add support to fallback to lower priority servers when higher priority ones are down (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/7701\">#7701</a>)</li>\n<li>dns: Add support for link local IPv6 addresses (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/7889\">#7889</a>)</li>\n<li>The new experimental <code>pickfirst</code> LB policy (disabled by default) supports Happy Eyeballs, interleaving IPv4 and IPv6 address as described in <a href=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8305#section-4\">RFC-8305 section 4</a>, to attempt connections to multiple backends concurrently. The experimental <code>pickfirst</code> policy can be enabled by setting the environment variable <code>GRPC_EXPERIMENTAL_ENABLE_NEW_PICK_FIRST</code> to <code>true</code>. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/7725\">#7725</a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/7742\">#7742</a>)</li>\n<li>balancer/pickfirst: Emit metrics from the <code>pick_first</code> load balancing policy (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/7839\">#7839</a>)</li>\n<li>grpc: export <code>MethodHandler</code>, which is the type of an already-exported field in <code>MethodDesc</code> (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/7796\">#7796</a>)\n<ul>\n<li>Special Thanks: <a href=\"https://github.com/mohdjishin\"><code>@​mohdjishin</code></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Bug Fixes</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>credentials/google: set scope for application default credentials (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/7887\">#7887</a>)\n<ul>\n<li>Special Thanks: <a href=\"https://github.com/halvards\"><code>@​halvards</code></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>xds: fix edge-case issues where some clients or servers would not initialize correctly or would not receive errors when resources are invalid or unavailable if another channel or server with the same target was already in use . (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/7851\">#7851</a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/7853\">#7853</a>)</li>\n<li>examples: fix the debugging example, which was broken by a recent change (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/7833\">#7833</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Behavior Changes</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>client: update retry attempt backoff to apply jitter per updates to <a href=\"https://github.com/grpc/proposal/blob/master/A6-client-retries.md\">gRFC A6</a>. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/7869\">#7869</a>)\n<ul>\n<li>Special Thanks: <a href=\"https://github.com/isgj\"><code>@​isgj</code></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>balancer/weightedroundrobin: use the <code>pick_first</code> LB policy to manage connections (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/7826\">#7826</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>API Changes</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>balancer: An internal method is added to the <code>balancer.SubConn</code> interface to force implementors to embed a delegate implementation. This requirement is present in the interface documentation, but wasn't enforced earlier. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/7840\">#7840</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Performance Improvements</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>mem: implement a <code>ReadAll()</code> method for more efficient <code>io.Reader</code> consumption (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/7653\">#7653</a>)\n<ul>\n<li>Special Thanks: <a href=\"https://github.com/ash2k\"><code>@​ash2k</code></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>mem: use slice capacity instead of length to determine whether to pool buffers or directly allocate them (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/7702\">#7702</a>)\n<ul>\n<li>Special Thanks: <a href=\"https://github.com/PapaCharlie\"><code>@​PapaCharlie</code></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Documentation</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>examples/csm_observability: Add xDS Credentials and switch server to be xDS enabled (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/7875\">#7875</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Release 1.68.1</h2>\n<h1>Bug Fixes</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>credentials/alts: avoid SRV and TXT lookups for handshaker service to work around hangs caused by buggy versions of systemd-resolved.

The two flaky tests both followed the pattern of \"remove the instruction prior to a bundle reading it\". And tried to assert a specific amount of elements would be read.\r\n* This isn't generally useful behavior.\r\n* There was no guarantee that the element channel would have ingested any data before the removal, short of a read being attempted.\r\n* Their case is better covered in other tests anyway, with deterministic results (eg PartialReadThenEndInstruction, which should always return 0s).\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

would like to use [gcs-connector](https://github.com/GoogleCloudDataproc/hadoop-connectors/tree/master/gcs) 3.x, which supports the new Parquet VectorIO feature. However, gcs-connector 3.x also drops Java 8 and targets Java 11, which blocks us from upgrading it directly in Beam, since Beam is still targeting 8 (see #31678).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, as a Beam user, I can't just upgrade gcs-connector on my end, due to breaking changes in how `GoogleCloudStorageImpl` is instantiated: in 2.x it has [public constructors](https://github.com/GoogleCloudDataproc/hadoop-connectors/blob/v2.2.26/gcsio/src/main/java/com/google/cloud/hadoop/gcsio/GoogleCloudStorageImpl.java#L302-L394), but in 3.x it [drops the public constructors and enforces a Builder pattern](https://github.com/GoogleCloudDataproc/hadoop-connectors/blob/v3.0.4/gcsio/src/main/java/com/google/cloud/hadoop/gcsio/GoogleCloudStorageImpl.java#L2496-L2517). \r\n\r\nTherefore, when running on gcs-connector 3.x, my pipeline throws a NoSuchMethodError from `org.apache.beam.sdk.extensions.gcp.util.GcsUtil` when it tries to invoke the 2.x constructor: https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/v2.61.0/sdks/java/extensions/google-cloud-platform-core/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/extensions/gcp/util/GcsUtil.java#L727\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a pipeline option for a GoogleCloudStorage Provider, so that users who want to use gcs-connector 3.x can be unblocked from doing so. It defaults to invoking the gcs-connector 2.x public constructor, but 3.x users can override it to use the Builder.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nGitHub Actions Tests Status (on master

removes the deprecated AWS v1 module.These IOs have been deprecated since Beam 2.41.0 (July 2022), with the message \"You are using a deprecated IO for DynamoDB. Please migrate to module 'org.apache.beam:beam-sdks-java-io-amazon-web-services2'.\", and the new libraries have been recommended for longer than that. The underlying libraries are in maintenance mode, with EOL scheduled for the end of [next year](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/announcing-end-of-support-for-aws-sdk-for-java-v1-x-on-december-31-2025/).

href=\"https://redirect.github.com/nats-io/nats-server/issues/6112\">#6112</a>)</li>\n<li>Consumer backoff should now be correctly respected with multiple in-flight deliveries to clients (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/nats-io/nats-server/issues/6104\">#6104</a>)</li>\n<li>Add node10 node size to stree, providing better memory utilisation for some subject spaces, particularly those that are primarily numeric or with numeric tokens (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/nats-io/nats-server/issues/6106\">#6106</a>)</li>\n<li>Some JetStream log lines have been made more consistent (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/nats-io/nats-server/issues/6065\">#6065</a>)</li>\n<li>File-backed Raft groups will now use the same sync intervals as the filestore, including when sync always

href=\"https://redirect.github.com/nats-io/nats-server/issues/6067\">#6067</a>)</li>\n<li>Consumers will now detect if an ack is received past the stream last sequence and will no longer register pre-acks from a snapshot if this happens, reducing memory usage (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/nats-io/nats-server/issues/6109\">#6109</a>)</li>\n<li>Reduced copies and number of allocations when generating headers for republished messages (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/nats-io/nats-server/issues/6127\">#6127</a>)</li>\n<li>Adjusted the spread of filestore sync timers (<a

values (bools, doubles), varints,  and length prefixed types.\r\n  * If the type can be length prefixed, then Prism will do that for that coder.\r\n  * Otherwise fails for unknown coders that can't be handled.\r\n  * Runner side, Only OrderedListState needs to parse the individual values, so they can be manipulated, so the length function plumbing isn't otherwise necessary. It would not be difficult to extend this for all state types in the future, should it be required.\r\n\r\nNote, must be submitted after #33337 because OrderedListState tests require OnWindowExpiration.\r\n\r\nFixes #32929. \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Adds tracking for keys used within a window, so the OnWindowExpiration callback can be invoked.\r\n* Restricts the output watermark from advancing until a window's been garbage collected and all keys have been expired.\r\n* Added a \"side channel\" mechanism to insert bundles for execution outside of normal execution flow.\r\n  * This may ultimately be used for ProcessingTime timers, as well as for Triggers/\r\n* Supports OnWindowExpiration, enabling initial GroupIntoBatches support. \r\n\r\nFixes #32211\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Contexts are largely deprecated as a notion in Beam, and aren't used, with the default being the \"nested\" coder context instead of the Outer context. There are a few places though that still set \"outer coder context\" by default, notably in the CoderUtils helper methods.\r\n\r\nWhere this manifests for TestStream is that CoderUtils is used to take elements and convert them into byte buffers when moved portably. While *most* coders now ignore the difference, for various legacy reasons, the KVCoder still pipes the context to the *value* coder, and some coders still understand and use the difference. In this case, the StringUTF8 coder, when given the Outer context, doesn't length prefix the string. \r\n\r\nThis leads to TestStream values being encoded in weird ways, that don't translate portably. eg. If the values are KV<String, String> the Key will be length prefixed, but the value will not be. This will ultimately cause a break at test run time, because the CoderUtils path isn't used in decoding over Beam Portability, but the normal decoder path, which wouldn't provide the Outer context.\r\n\r\nThis is likely what's caused difficulty in using TestStream in non-Java SDKs, such as Go on Flink.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

href=\"https://github.com/numpy/numpy/releases\">numpy's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>2.2.0  (Dec 8, 2024)</h2>\n<h1>NumPy 2.2.0 Release Notes</h1>\n<p>The NumPy 2.2.0 release is quick release that brings us back into sync\nwith the usual twice yearly release cycle. There have been an number of\nsmall cleanups, as well as work bringing the new StringDType to\ncompletion and improving support for free threaded Python. Highlights\nare:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>New functions <code>matvec</code> and <code>vecmat</code>, see below.</li>\n<li>Many improved annotations.</li>\n<li>Improved support for the new StringDType.</li>\n<li>Improved support for free threaded Python</li>\n<li>Fixes for f2py</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This release supports Python versions 3.10-3.13.</p>\n<h2>Deprecations</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><code>_add_newdoc_ufunc</code> is now deprecated. <code>ufunc.__doc__ = newdoc</code>\nshould be used instead.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/27735\">gh-27735</a>)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Expired deprecations</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><code>bool(np.array([]))</code> and other empty arrays will now raise an error.\nUse <code>arr.size &gt; 0</code> instead to check whether an array has no\nelements.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/27160\">gh-27160</a>)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Compatibility notes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><code>numpy.cov</code> now properly transposes single-row (2d\narray) design matrices when <code>rowvar=False</code>. Previously, single-row\ndesign matrices would return a scalar in this scenario, which is not\ncorrect, so this is a behavior change and an array of the\nappropriate shape will now be returned.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/27661\">gh-27661</a>)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>New Features</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>New functions for matrix-vector and vector-matrix products</p>\n<p>Two new generalized ufuncs were defined:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>numpy.matvec</code> - matrix-vector product, treating the\narguments as stacks of matrices and column vectors,</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

This should be read together with the\n:ref:<code>general release guide &lt;prepare_release&gt;</code>.</p>\n<h1>Facility preparation</h1>\n<p>Before beginning to make a release, use the <code>requirements/*_requirements.txt</code> files to\nensure that you have the needed software. Most software can be installed with\npip, but some will require apt-get, dnf, or whatever your system uses for\nsoftware. You will also need a GitHub personal access token (PAT) to push the\ndocumentation. There are a few ways to streamline things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Git can be set up to use a keyring to store your GitHub personal access token.\nSearch online for the details.</li>\n<li>You can use the <code>keyring</code> app to store the PyPI password for twine. See the\nonline twine documentation for details.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Prior to release</h1>\n<h2>Add/drop Python versions</h2>\n<p>When adding or dropping Python versions, three files need to be edited:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>.github/workflows/wheels.yml  # for github cibuildwheel</li>\n<li>tools/ci/cirrus_wheels.yml  # for cibuildwheel aarch64/arm64 builds</li>\n<li>pyproject.toml  # for classifier and minimum version check.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Make these changes in an ordinary PR against main and backport if necessary.\nAdd <code>[wheel build]</code> at the end of the title line of the commit summary so\nthat wheel builds will be run to test the changes. We currently release wheels\nfor new Python versions after the first Python rc once manylinux and\ncibuildwheel support it. For Python 3.11 we were able to release within a week\nof the rc1 announcement.</p>\n<h2>Backport pull requests</h2>\n<p>Changes that have been marked for this release must be backported to the\nmaintenance/2.1.x branch.</p>\n<h2>Update 2.1.0 milestones</h2>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

add a meaningful description for your change here\r\n\r\nfixes #20943\r\n\r\nThis PR improves the performance of GroupByKey transform in SparkRunner by replacing the current implementation that uses Spark's `groupByKey` with `combineByKey`. \r\n\r\nThe current implementation uses Spark's `groupByKey` which causes all the data to be shuffled across the network before grouping. This can lead to significant performance overhead and potential OOM issues with large datasets.\r\n\r\nBy switching to Spark's `combineByKey`, we can:\r\n- Perform partial combining at the map side before shuffling\r\n- Reduce the amount of data transferred across the network\r\n- Improve memory utilization and overall performance\r\n\r\n\r\n## Before optimized - `6.1GiB` for shuffle\r\n<img width=\"1257\" alt=\"스크린샷 2024-12-08 오후 7 42 03\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/871f066c-3802-425e-80e1-119edd6d3e19\">\r\n\r\n## After optimized - `1487.7MiB` for shuffle.\r\n<img width=\"1250\" alt=\"스크린샷 2024-12-08 오후 9 22 45\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53b5197d-6df4-42bc-9c8a-7494ee8d6b47\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

is a POC showing how state multiplexing can work for GroupByKey. \r\n\r\n- Messages with small keys (<4K) are hashed and shuffled to a fixed set of virtual sharding keys and get reduced on the virtual keys.\r\n- The actual keys are sent to the virtual keys as part of windows.\r\n- Existing combining, aggregations work at the window level, so they all work out of the box.\r\n\r\nThe 4k threshold is currently an arbitrary small value and can be tweaked. The constraint is any state tags should not exceed 64k and keys are now part of the windowed state tags.\r\n\r\nNeed to cleanup comments and add tests, sending this to share the idea and get initial feedback.\r\n\r\n\r\nR: @scwhittle

keepalive pings between SDK harness and SDK worker.\r\n\r\nWe have introduced the non-default ping configuration to work around a GRPC bug https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-6258. According to [GRPC docs](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/keepalive.md), by default, clients don't set this ping since the timeout is set to a default large value. We can remove the default altogether or set it likewise to a large value in case somehow the pings are enabled unintentionally.\r\n\r\nSending pings appears to cause pipeline failures in some cases due to ping timeout errors.   \r\n\r\n \r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

the Beam Python Load Test framework to pull cost-relevant metrics for pipeline execution and calculate an expected cost to execute the pipeline on GCP Dataflow. This also includes an example benchmark using Wordcount on the text of King Lear and all of the configuration necessary to run the benchmark as a Github Action. This will not be configured to run as a cron job, as the cost of the pipeline is very low (< $0.02) and is not a particularly interesting example for users; however, this code will serve as a template for later, more interesting benchmarks. \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

href=\"https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/releases\">google.golang.org/grpc's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Release 1.68.1</h2>\n<h1>Bug Fixes</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>credentials/alts: avoid SRV and TXT lookups for handshaker service to work around hangs caused by buggy versions of systemd-resolved. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/7861\">#7861</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Dependencies</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Relax minimum Go version requirement from <code>go1.22.7</code> to <code>go1.22</code>. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/7831\">#7831</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Release 1.68.0</h2>\n<h1>Known Issues</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>The recently added <code>grpc.NewClient</code> function is incompatible with forward proxies, because it resolves the target hostname on the client instead of passing the hostname to the proxy. This bug has been present since the introduction of <code>NewClient</code>. A fix is expected to be a part of grpc-go v1.70. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/7556\">#7556</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h1>Behavior Changes</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>stats/opentelemetry/csm: Get mesh_id local label from &quot;CSM_MESH_ID&quot; environment variable, rather than parsing from bootstrap file (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/7740\">#7740</a>)</li>\n<li>orca (experimental): if using an ORCA listener, it must now be registered only on a READY SubConn, and the listener will automatically be stopped when the connection is lost. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/7663\">#7663</a>)</li>\n<li>client: <code>ClientConn.Close()</code> now closes transports simultaneously and waits for transports to be closed before returning. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/7666\">#7666</a>)</li>\n<li>credentials: TLS credentials created via <code>NewTLS</code> that use <code>tls.Config.GetConfigForClient</code> will now have CipherSuites, supported TLS versions and ALPN configured automatically. These were previously only set for configs not using the <code>GetConfigForClient</code> option. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/7709\">#7709</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Bug Fixes</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>transport: prevent deadlock in client transport shutdown when writing the GOAWAY frame hangs. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/7662\">#7662</a>)</li>\n<li>mem: reuse buffers more accurately by using slice capacity instead of length (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/7702\">#7702</a>)\n<ul>\n<li>Special Thanks: <a href=\"https://github.com/PapaCharlie\"><code>@​PapaCharlie</code></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>status: Fix regression caused by <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/6919\">#6919</a> in status.Details() causing it to return a wrapped type when getting proto messages generated with protoc-gen-go &lt; v1. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/7724\">#7724</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Dependencies</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Bump minimum supported Go version to <code>go1.22.7</code>.

[google.golang.org/grpc](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go) from 1.67.1 to 1.68.0.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/releases\">google.golang.org/grpc's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Release 1.68.0</h2>\n<h1>Known Issues</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>The recently added <code>grpc.NewClient</code> function is incompatible with forward proxies, because it resolves the target hostname on the client instead of passing the hostname to the proxy. This bug has been present since the introduction of <code>NewClient</code>. A fix is expected to be a part of grpc-go v1.70. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/7556\">#7556</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h1>Behavior Changes</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>stats/opentelemetry/csm: Get mesh_id local label from &quot;CSM_MESH_ID&quot; environment variable, rather than parsing from bootstrap file (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/7740\">#7740</a>)</li>\n<li>orca (experimental): if using an ORCA listener, it must now be registered only on a READY SubConn, and the listener will automatically be stopped when the connection is lost. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/7663\">#7663</a>)</li>\n<li>client: <code>ClientConn.Close()</code> now closes transports simultaneously and waits for transports to be closed before returning. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/7666\">#7666</a>)</li>\n<li>credentials: TLS credentials created via <code>NewTLS</code> that use <code>tls.Config.GetConfigForClient</code> will now have CipherSuites, supported TLS versions and ALPN configured automatically. These were previously only set for configs not using the <code>GetConfigForClient</code> option. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/7709\">#7709</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Bug Fixes</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>transport: prevent deadlock in client transport shutdown when writing the GOAWAY frame hangs. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/7662\">#7662</a>)</li>\n<li>mem: reuse buffers more accurately by using slice capacity instead of length (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/7702\">#7702</a>)\n<ul>\n<li>Special Thanks: <a href=\"https://github.com/PapaCharlie\"><code>@​PapaCharlie</code></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>status: Fix regression caused by <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/6919\">#6919</a> in status.Details() causing it to return a wrapped type when getting proto messages generated with protoc-gen-go &lt; v1. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/7724\">#7724</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Dependencies</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Bump minimum supported Go version to <code>go1.22.7</code>.

was hanging due to timers being fired in incorrect order. The issue was that the heap variant wasn't being maintained on inserting timers for a key. This would cause timers to fire out of event time ordering. In particular, the \"GC\" timer would fire first (because it was set first), instead of the earlier firing \"append\" timer.\r\n\r\nThis incorrect ordering was also what caused testTwoTimersSettingEachOtherWithCreateAsInputUnbounded to fail.\r\n\r\nFixes #32222.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

infrastructure and tests have a number of logical branches based on the current running python version so we can support features that are present in some officially supported python versions but not in others. The typehint module contained some conditional branches looking for versions before 3.9, which is now the minimum, so this PR cleans up that dead code and branch conditions that were always true.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
