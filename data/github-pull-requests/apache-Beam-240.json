This is an updated and condensed PR for the original PR: https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/2509\r\n\r\n**Description**:\r\nI partially (!) fixed the issue by getting the location of the source table. Then I use this location as location of the created temp dataset. The added parameters are optional and should not break anything.\r\n\r\n**Tests**: I tested with an US and EU dataset as source in a `DirectRunner`, i.e., using a `BigQuerySource` with `table=<some-table>`.\r\n\r\n**What's missing**: It does not work for a `BigQuerySource` with `query=<some-query>`.\r\n\r\nThe corresponding Jira issue should not yet be closed.","created_at":"2017-04-18T19:19:08Z","updated_at":"2017-04-20T00:56:34Z","closed_at":"2017-04-20T00:56:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"688d32c4c151ed8e89bb915703652f5b67c3d17e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/2582/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/2582/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/2582/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/e2df2a2d4b0a8cf1a33ada18f1ae0f2d9c24b415","head":{"label":"ubunatic:set-temp-table-region-for-table-source","ref":"set-temp-table-region-for-table-source","sha":"e2df2a2d4b0a8cf1a33ada18f1ae0f2d9c24b415","user":{"login":"ubunatic","id":532284,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMjI4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/532284?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ubunatic","html_url":"https://github.com/ubunatic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ubunatic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ubunatic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ubunatic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ubunatic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ubunatic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ubunatic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ubunatic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ubunatic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ubunatic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":87805358,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4NzgwNTM1OA==","name":"beam","full_name":"ubunatic/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ubunatic","id":532284,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMjI4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/532284?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ubunatic","html_url":"https://github.com/ubunatic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ubunatic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ubunatic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ubunatic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ubunatic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ubunatic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ubunatic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ubunatic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ubunatic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ubunatic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ubunatic/beam","description":"Mirror

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-1983\r\n\r\nThe two nontrivial changes here are \"Creates ProcessFnRunner\" and \"Explodes windows\".\r\nOverall, the current PR works by:\r\n- Exploding windows before GBKIKWI so that every KWI going into ProcessFn contains only 1 element, and that element is in only 1 window. This way, every ProcessElement call happens in a well-defined window which both makes sense for setting the namespace of the timer in case the fn needs to resume, and makes it clear where to get side inputs if the fn has any. This of course comes at the cost of not propagating windows of input to output, but makes the implementation much simpler.\r\n- Creating a DoFnRunner that is aware of the fact that, when processing a WindowedValue<KeyedWorkItem>, the important window for fetching side inputs is not the outer one, but the one inside elementsIterable or inside timersIterable. The runner is actually specialized to run only ProcessFn, so it knows that there's only 1 element or only 1 timer, so it's easier to extract the window. Also, it's not a DoFnRunner per se, but a PushbackSideInputDoFnRunner - so that it's easier to integrate into existing runners, as shown by integrating into direct runner's ParDoEvaluator with little effort.\r\n\r\nR: @tgroh

sure to do all of the following to help us incorporate your contribution\r\nquickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [X] Make sure the PR title is formatted like:\r\n   `[BEAM-<Jira issue #>] Description of pull request`\r\n - [X] Make sure tests pass via `mvn clean verify`. (Even better, enable\r\n       Travis-CI on your fork and ensure the whole test matrix passes).\r\n - [X] Replace `<Jira issue #>` in the title with the actual Jira issue\r\n       number, if there is one.\r\n - [X] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache\r\n       [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\nThe HIFIO jdk1.8-tests directory contains dependencies that require java8 (notably cassandra.) \r\n\r\nThe enforcer rules in jdk1.8-test mean that enforcer won't treat that as a problem, however the module itself was still compiling in that scenario.  This change makes it so that the module is skipped.\r\n\r\nI've verified this fix works by doing mvn clean verify on a machine with java8 and a machine with only java7 (which previously failed mvn clean verify) - I also verified that the jdk1.8-tests module actually compiled on the java8 machine and that we can still run the integration tests.\r\n\r\nmvn is a tricky one, so let me know if there's something I haven't thought of/etc...\r\n\r\nPresumably, we will need java8-only modules in the future, so I'm guessing this will be a pattern that may be followed elsewhere (eg. in the upcoming cassandra module - cc @jbonofre )\r\n\r\nR @dhalperi

(Even better, enable\r\n       Travis-CI on your fork and ensure the whole test matrix passes).\r\n - [x] Replace `<Jira issue #>` in the title with the actual Jira issue\r\n       number, if there is one.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache\r\n       [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\nHaving two methods, both named output, one which takes the \"main output type\" and one that takes a tag to specify the type more clearly communicates the actual behavior - sideOutput isn't a \"special\" way to output, it's the same as output(T), just to a specified PCollection. This will help pipeline authors understand the actual behavior of outputting to a tag, and detangle it from \"sideInput\", which is a special way to receive input. Giving them the same name means that it's not even strange to call output and provide the main output type, which is what we want - it's a more specific way to output, but does not have different restrictions or capabilities.\r\n","created_at":"2017-04-12T16:44:27Z","updated_at":"2017-04-14T21:41:26Z","closed_at":"2017-04-14T21:41:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a51b9edd5150d6810c946568b71b4ba1a8ee7404","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/2512/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/2512/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/2512/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/36f9d90348cb52536ab1b25947da6e8fafc1cf75","head":{"label":"tgroh:side_output_to_output","ref":"side_output_to_output","sha":"36f9d90348cb52536ab1b25947da6e8fafc1cf75","user":{"login":"tgroh","id":429866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTg2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/429866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh","html_url":"https://github.com/tgroh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52644388,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MjY0NDM4OA==","name":"beam","full_name":"tgroh/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tgroh","id":429866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTg2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/429866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh","html_url":"https://github.com/tgroh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tgroh/beam","description":"Mirror

JdbcTestDataSet's main, since it is no longer necessary for\r\nloading data.\r\n\r\nBe sure to do all of the following to help us incorporate your contribution\r\nquickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [X] Make sure the PR title is formatted like:\r\n   `[BEAM-<Jira issue #>] Description of pull request`\r\n - [X] Make sure tests pass via `mvn clean verify`. (Even better, enable\r\n       Travis-CI on your fork and ensure the whole test matrix passes).\r\n - [X] Replace `<Jira issue #>` in the title with the actual Jira issue\r\n       number, if there is one.\r\n - [X] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache\r\n       [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\nI've now switched JdbcIOIT to do a write then a read. This code:\r\n* creates a table during test class setup (this runs on the client)\r\n* during the write test, generates data and populates data into that table\r\n* reads the data from the table and verifies it via HashingFn + count\r\n\r\nI really like the data generation - feels very clean, and I love the fact that using CountingSource means this part can be parallelized for larger data sets. I suspect that we may choose to refactor the \"generate data\" portion out into a helper method alongside HashingFn in io-common.\r\n\r\nR @dhalperi
