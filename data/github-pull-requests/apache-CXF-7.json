draft introduces CustomerizedAlgorithmSuite according to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CXF-8971\r\n\r\nSeveral pieces of code might need claricfication/discussion.\r\n\r\n -------------------- Edited ------------------------------\r\n\r\n**commit 1**\r\n\r\n~Commit 1 works on its own (could be merged separately - it is finished).~\r\n\r\n- ~New default algorithm suite (name `CustomerizedAlgorithmSuite`) is registered in `DefaultAlgorithmSuiteLoader`. Default values of this suites are compliant with the FIPS.~\r\n- ~New test `WSSecurity10CustomerizedAlgorithmSuiteTest` (based on `WSSecurity10Test`) is introduced. This test ~can be successfully run on the machine with FIPS. (Parameter `-Dorg.apache.xml.security.securerandom.algorithm=PKCS1` is required in such case)\r\n- ~New certificates are required to fulfill FIPS. I added a script `generate-certs.sh', which could be used for its generation.~\r\n\r\n**commit 2**\r\n\r\n- ~Security properties for customization of the alg suite are created (prefix `ws-security.custom.alg.suite .`)~\r\n- ~Those properties are used in `AlgorithmSuiteTranslater` and  `PolicyBasedWSS4JOutInterceptor` to modify customize alg. suite.~\r\n\r\n### Problems\r\n\r\n1. ~It is not  possible to set properties via setters into algSuiteType (see missing setters in https://github.com/apache/ws-wss4j/blob/wss4j-3.0.1/policy/src/main/java/org/apache/wss4j/policy/model/AlgorithmSuite.java#L434-L440) and commit (https://github.com/apache/ws-wss4j/commit/2a5dff9ebb0b7b809cc3d4c75139b9b7e20604ce). Which means, that the customization on e.g. `PolicyBasedWSS4JOutInterceptor` can not change much. We would need to add setters to make customization work (as is prepared in this PR)~\r\n\r\n### Questions and suggestions (about commit 2)\r\n\r\n1.  ~Would it make sense to merge commit 1 on its own?  (From my POV it makes sense, because it would make configuration in FIPS possible)~\r\n2. ~There are 2 security parameters already present (`ws-security.symmetric.signature.algorithm` and `ws-security.asymmetric.signature.algorithm`). My understanding is, that their functionality is almost the same as is defined for customized alg. suite. Therefore it would make sense, to skip `ws-security.custom.alg.suite.asymmetric.key.encryption.algorithm` and `ws-security.custom.alg.suite.symmetric.key.encryption.algorithm`~\r\n3. ~I think that it is not needed to call `CustomerizedAlgorithmSuite` in that way. I would like to call the suite something like `FipsBasic256Sha256gcmRsa15` or perhaps `FipsBasic256` - this name would show the intent, that the default values are FIPS compliant **AND** the customization mechanism would be used every-time (not just for customerizedAlgorithmSuite) -> which means that user could not \"customize\" but rather \"set\" algorithm via properties, if not specified, the alg. suite defined in the policy would be used as now. (which is the behavior of `ws-security.symmetric.signature.algorithm` and `ws-security.asymmetric.signature.algorithm` currently)~\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### TODO\r\n\r\n1. ~After answering the questions, the customization should be probably added into `PolicyBasedWSS4JStaxInInterceptor`, `StaxAsymmetricBindingHandler`, `StaxSymmetricBindingHandler` and `StaxTransportBindingHandler` as well.~\r\n2. ~Ideally add a test covering the customized alg

[io.zipkin.reporter2:zipkin-sender-okhttp3](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java) from 2.17.1 to 3.2.1.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/releases\">io.zipkin.reporter2:zipkin-sender-okhttp3's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Zipkin Reporter 3.1 adds custom encoding (non-JSON) support for zipkin-reporter-brave's <code>AsyncZipkinSpanHandler</code>.</p>\n<p>This was first used in <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-gcp/tree/master/encoder-stackdriver-brave\">encoder-stackdriver-brave)</a> to allow traced apps to send spans to stackdriver without a zipkin core jar dependency</p>\n<pre lang=\"java\"><code>spanHandler = AsyncZipkinSpanHandler.newBuilder(sender).build(new StackdriverV2Encoder(Tags.ERROR));\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Full Changelog</strong>: <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/compare/3.0.1...3.1.1\">https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/compare/3.0.1...3.1.1</a></p>\n<p>Zipkin Reporter 3.0.1 fixes a problem where classpath scanners such as spring would trigger a <code>zipkin2.Span</code> class load on <code>AsyncZipkinSpanHandler</code> in <a href=\"https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/io.zipkin.reporter2/zipkin-reporter-brave\">zipkin-reporter-brave</a>, which intentionally has no dependency on that.</p>\n<p>Zipkin Reporter 3.0.0 makes the <a href=\"https://central.sonatype.com/search?q=io.zipkin.zipkin2%3Azipkin\">io.zipkin.zipkin2:zipkin</a> dependency of <a href=\"https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:io.zipkin.reporter2%20AND%20a:zipkin-reporter-brave\">io.zipkin.reporter2:zipkin-reporter-brave</a> optional. This means those using the <code>AsyncZipkinSpanHandler</code> will have no dependencies except any sender they configure. In particular, this allows those using Brave for things besides zipkin (e.g. wavefront) to avoid a dependency. Also, those sending spans zipkin have simpler dependency configuration and save a couple hundred KB, as well.</p>\n<p>Those using types from the core <a href=\"https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:io.zipkin.reporter2%20AND%20a:zipkin-reporter\">io.zipkin.reporter2:zipkin-reporter</a> artifact should depend on this directly, possibly using <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java#version-alignments\">our bom</a> to align deps. <code>io.zipkin.reporter2:zipkin-reporter</code> still defaults to depend on <code>io.zipkin.zipkin2:zipkin</code>, but it can be excluded if you know what you are doing.</p>\n<p>Technically, some base classes to accommodate this, but they don't have affect on call sites except those implementing a custom <code>Reporter</code> or <code>Sender</code>. Due to these type changes, this is a major version change. However, must users will have a drop-in experience, except possibly dependency configuration changes.</p>\n<p>Thanks a lot to <a href=\"https://github.com/anuraaga\"><code>@​anuraaga</code></a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/reta\"><code>@​reta</code></a> who helped think through this!</p>\n<h2>Zipkin Reporter 2.17.2</h2>\n<p>Zipkin Reporter v2.17.2 fixes a bug where the jars that should be at Java 1.6 or 1.7 bytecode were not.</p>\n<p><strong>Full Changelog</strong>: <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/compare/2.17.0..2.17.2\">https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/compare/2.17.0..2.17.2</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/commit/457009d3ca9e66e3202979732309ae98cf755588\"><code>457009d</code></a> [maven-release-plugin] prepare release 3.2.1</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/commit/6e992f9bd8c3ac3d58aebfd7ba527ee32dc0d028\"><code>6e992f9</code></a> Adds deprecated functions for old Sender (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/issues/246\">#246</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/commit/ee8c0f105021e1f421d4104550adb145c8b3a51b\"><code>ee8c0f1</code></a> [maven-release-plugin] prepare for next development iteration</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/commit/e772cee253af0e577dfd993bf5cdb98975671da0\"><code>e772cee</code></a> [maven-release-plugin] prepare release 3.2.0</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/commit/22b0e371f80c8028568c09915461d5c2fe84a2e9\"><code>22b0e37</code></a> Deprecates Sender for much simpler BytesMessageSender (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/issues/244\">#244</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/commit/2dbac71bea72aa214cdba1a8f0c86a2eb5f0a272\"><code>2dbac71</code></a> docker: polishes integration tests (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/issues/243\">#243</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/commit/d97c01453ec743eecb3d10c0d0beaa1a2c3da8df\"><code>d97c014</code></a> bumps to brave 6 and warns about zipkin dep version (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/issues/242\">#242</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/commit/35db29bcc9b40102c62843e0930ea46f2a037354\"><code>35db29b</code></a> [maven-release-plugin] prepare for next development iteration</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/commit/9508452041d55a9717cb18b4f7ad8ae88d56288e\"><code>9508452</code></a> [maven-release-plugin] prepare release 3.1.1</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/commit/9c666c4156e24aa3a4db198946d2f5edba46065e\"><code>9c666c4</code></a> ci: deploys bom separately to allow re-do on partial failure (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/issues/241\">#241</a>)</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/compare/2.17.1...3.2.1\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=io.zipkin.reporter2:zipkin-sender-okhttp3&package-manager=maven&previous-version=2.17.1&new-version=3.2.1)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

Due to these type changes, this is a major version change. However, must users will have a drop-in experience, except possibly dependency configuration changes.</p>\n<p>Thanks a lot to <a href=\"https://github.com/anuraaga\"><code>@​anuraaga</code></a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/reta\"><code>@​reta</code></a> who helped think through this!</p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/commit/457009d3ca9e66e3202979732309ae98cf755588\"><code>457009d</code></a> [maven-release-plugin] prepare release 3.2.1</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/commit/6e992f9bd8c3ac3d58aebfd7ba527ee32dc0d028\"><code>6e992f9</code></a> Adds deprecated functions for old Sender (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/issues/246\">#246</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/commit/ee8c0f105021e1f421d4104550adb145c8b3a51b\"><code>ee8c0f1</code></a> [maven-release-plugin] prepare for next development iteration</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/commit/e772cee253af0e577dfd993bf5cdb98975671da0\"><code>e772cee</code></a> [maven-release-plugin] prepare release 3.2.0</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/commit/22b0e371f80c8028568c09915461d5c2fe84a2e9\"><code>22b0e37</code></a> Deprecates Sender for much simpler BytesMessageSender (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/issues/244\">#244</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/commit/2dbac71bea72aa214cdba1a8f0c86a2eb5f0a272\"><code>2dbac71</code></a> docker: polishes integration tests (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/issues/243\">#243</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/commit/d97c01453ec743eecb3d10c0d0beaa1a2c3da8df\"><code>d97c014</code></a> bumps to brave 6 and warns about zipkin dep version (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/issues/242\">#242</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/commit/35db29bcc9b40102c62843e0930ea46f2a037354\"><code>35db29b</code></a> [maven-release-plugin] prepare for next development iteration</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/commit/9508452041d55a9717cb18b4f7ad8ae88d56288e\"><code>9508452</code></a> [maven-release-plugin] prepare release 3.1.1</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/commit/9c666c4156e24aa3a4db198946d2f5edba46065e\"><code>9c666c4</code></a> ci: deploys bom separately to allow re-do on partial failure (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/issues/241\">#241</a>)</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/compare/2.17.2...3.2.1\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

[io.zipkin.reporter2:zipkin-sender-okhttp3](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java) from 2.17.1 to 3.1.1.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/releases\">io.zipkin.reporter2:zipkin-sender-okhttp3's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Zipkin Reporter 3.1 adds custom encoding (non-JSON) support for zipkin-reporter-brave's <code>AsyncZipkinSpanHandler</code>.</p>\n<p>This was first used in <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-gcp/tree/master/encoder-stackdriver-brave\">encoder-stackdriver-brave)</a> to allow traced apps to send spans to stackdriver without a zipkin core jar dependency</p>\n<pre lang=\"java\"><code>spanHandler = AsyncZipkinSpanHandler.newBuilder(sender).build(new StackdriverV2Encoder(Tags.ERROR));\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Full Changelog</strong>: <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/compare/3.0.1...3.1.1\">https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/compare/3.0.1...3.1.1</a></p>\n<p>Zipkin Reporter 3.0.1 fixes a problem where classpath scanners such as spring would trigger a <code>zipkin2.Span</code> class load on <code>AsyncZipkinSpanHandler</code> in <a href=\"https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/io.zipkin.reporter2/zipkin-reporter-brave\">zipkin-reporter-brave</a>, which intentionally has no dependency on that.</p>\n<p>Zipkin Reporter 3.0.0 makes the <a href=\"https://central.sonatype.com/search?q=io.zipkin.zipkin2%3Azipkin\">io.zipkin.zipkin2:zipkin</a> dependency of <a href=\"https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:io.zipkin.reporter2%20AND%20a:zipkin-reporter-brave\">io.zipkin.reporter2:zipkin-reporter-brave</a> optional. This means those using the <code>AsyncZipkinSpanHandler</code> will have no dependencies except any sender they configure. In particular, this allows those using Brave for things besides zipkin (e.g. wavefront) to avoid a dependency. Also, those sending spans zipkin have simpler dependency configuration and save a couple hundred KB, as well.</p>\n<p>Those using types from the core <a href=\"https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:io.zipkin.reporter2%20AND%20a:zipkin-reporter\">io.zipkin.reporter2:zipkin-reporter</a> artifact should depend on this directly, possibly using <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java#version-alignments\">our bom</a> to align deps. <code>io.zipkin.reporter2:zipkin-reporter</code> still defaults to depend on <code>io.zipkin.zipkin2:zipkin</code>, but it can be excluded if you know what you are doing.</p>\n<p>Technically, some base classes to accommodate this, but they don't have affect on call sites except those implementing a custom <code>Reporter</code> or <code>Sender</code>. Due to these type changes, this is a major version change. However, must users will have a drop-in experience, except possibly dependency configuration changes.</p>\n<p>Thanks a lot to <a href=\"https://github.com/anuraaga\"><code>@​anuraaga</code></a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/reta\"><code>@​reta</code></a> who helped think through this!</p>\n<h2>Zipkin Reporter 2.17.2</h2>\n<p>Zipkin Reporter v2.17.2 fixes a bug where the jars that should be at Java 1.6 or 1.7 bytecode were not.</p>\n<p><strong>Full Changelog</strong>: <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/compare/2.17.0..2.17.2\">https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/compare/2.17.0..2.17.2</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/commit/9508452041d55a9717cb18b4f7ad8ae88d56288e\"><code>9508452</code></a> [maven-release-plugin] prepare release 3.1.1</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/commit/9c666c4156e24aa3a4db198946d2f5edba46065e\"><code>9c666c4</code></a> ci: deploys bom separately to allow re-do on partial failure (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/issues/241\">#241</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/commit/73ac34b4cd0b552ec046948a30dd69c5d86e0193\"><code>73ac34b</code></a> Increases deploy timeouts due to recent failures uploading to sonatype (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/issues/240\">#240</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/commit/4c57453c2cef8354eb6b55b4d7306b702dc7f27c\"><code>4c57453</code></a> [maven-release-plugin] prepare for next development iteration</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/commit/36a160d91665fef54bf22cc5f3629a55326ee666\"><code>36a160d</code></a> [maven-release-plugin] prepare release 3.1.0</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/commit/dea1650145b7bb95d8cf02d10270128391ea179d\"><code>dea1650</code></a> brave: allows AsyncZipkinSpanHandler to be built with custom formats (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/issues/239\">#239</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/commit/af70e4cc4d79ef739d6b4d61e58e38cf643ff8c3\"><code>af70e4c</code></a> [maven-release-plugin] prepare for next development iteration</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/commit/4587e0e947c9277121ab564e2e703ca5f7420191\"><code>4587e0e</code></a> [maven-release-plugin] prepare release 3.0.2</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/commit/3f9229da447ec0ab79aa58591b6296d6c94d4516\"><code>3f9229d</code></a> [maven-release-plugin] prepare for next development iteration</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/commit/a21e3e48536620ba289b82fa1bc21e8dc9d67862\"><code>a21e3e4</code></a> [maven-release-plugin] prepare release 3.0.1</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/compare/2.17.1...3.1.1\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=io.zipkin.reporter2:zipkin-sender-okhttp3&package-manager=maven&previous-version=2.17.1&new-version=3.1.1)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

However, must users will have a drop-in experience, except possibly dependency configuration changes.</p>\n<p>Thanks a lot to <a href=\"https://github.com/anuraaga\"><code>@​anuraaga</code></a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/reta\"><code>@​reta</code></a> who helped think through this!</p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/commit/9508452041d55a9717cb18b4f7ad8ae88d56288e\"><code>9508452</code></a> [maven-release-plugin] prepare release 3.1.1</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/commit/9c666c4156e24aa3a4db198946d2f5edba46065e\"><code>9c666c4</code></a> ci: deploys bom separately to allow re-do on partial failure (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/issues/241\">#241</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/commit/73ac34b4cd0b552ec046948a30dd69c5d86e0193\"><code>73ac34b</code></a> Increases deploy timeouts due to recent failures uploading to sonatype (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/issues/240\">#240</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/commit/4c57453c2cef8354eb6b55b4d7306b702dc7f27c\"><code>4c57453</code></a> [maven-release-plugin] prepare for next development iteration</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/commit/36a160d91665fef54bf22cc5f3629a55326ee666\"><code>36a160d</code></a> [maven-release-plugin] prepare release 3.1.0</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/commit/dea1650145b7bb95d8cf02d10270128391ea179d\"><code>dea1650</code></a> brave: allows AsyncZipkinSpanHandler to be built with custom formats (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/issues/239\">#239</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/commit/af70e4cc4d79ef739d6b4d61e58e38cf643ff8c3\"><code>af70e4c</code></a> [maven-release-plugin] prepare for next development iteration</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/commit/4587e0e947c9277121ab564e2e703ca5f7420191\"><code>4587e0e</code></a> [maven-release-plugin] prepare release 3.0.2</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/commit/3f9229da447ec0ab79aa58591b6296d6c94d4516\"><code>3f9229d</code></a> [maven-release-plugin] prepare for next development iteration</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/commit/a21e3e48536620ba289b82fa1bc21e8dc9d67862\"><code>a21e3e4</code></a> [maven-release-plugin] prepare release 3.0.1</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/compare/2.17.2...3.1.1\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

`cxf.brave.version` from 5.17.1 to 6.0.0.\nUpdates `io.zipkin.brave:brave` from 5.17.1 to 6.0.0\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/brave/releases\">io.zipkin.brave:brave's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Brave 6 removes all modules and functions deprecated in Brave 5.x. It no longer has any dependency on io.zipkin.zipkin2:zipkin. Special thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/reta\"><code>@​reta</code></a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/anuraaga\"><code>@​anuraaga</code></a> for a lot of review support leading to this release!</p>\n<h2>No more deprecated functions</h2>\n<p>The final release of Brave 5 with deprecated functions was 5.18.1. Removing these functions was the only way to decouple Brave from zipkin's core library (io.zipkin.zipkin2:zipkin). However, this does not change Brave's floor Java 6 support. We still integration test this via the <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/brave-example\">brave-example</a> repository.</p>\n<p>Here's an example of a working Java 6 and Spring 2.5 application, which is 280KB smaller due to use of the lean combination of Brave 6 and Zipkin Reporter 3.x:</p>\n<pre><code># brave 5.18.1\n3860    target/brave-example-webmvc25-1.0-SNAPSHOT.war\n# brave 6.0.0\n3580    target/brave-example-webmvc25-1.0-SNAPSHOT.war\n</code></pre>\n<h2>No more io.zipkin.reporter2:zipkin-reporter or io.zipkin.zipkin2:zipkin dependencies</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/io.zipkin.brave/brave-bom\">io.zipkin.brave:brave-bom</a> used to manage zipkin-reporter dependencies. Since Brave no longer has dependencies on zipkin, it no longer manages them.</p>\n<p>This impact is that users will need to manage their own versions for zipkin-reporter, likely via <a href=\"https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/io.zipkin.reporter2/zipkin-reporter-bom\">io.zipkin.reporter2:zipkin-reporter-bom</a> described in the <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java#library-releases\">zipkin-reporter README</a>.</p>\n<p>To fully remove a zipkin core library dependency from your traced applications, use <a href=\"https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/io.zipkin.reporter2/zipkin-reporter-brave\">io.zipkin.reporter2:zipkin-reporter-brave</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/releases/tag/3.1.1\">3.x</a> <code>AsyncZipkinSpanHandler</code>. This is described in the <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java#library-releases\">zipkin-reporter README</a>. You can expect currently maintained frameworks to do this on your behalf.</p>\n<p>Thanks for your patience with the major upgrade. Things like this allow easier maintenance and a longer life for Brave, particularly as zipkin-server moves ahead with later Java versions.</p>\n<p><strong>Full Changelog</strong>: <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/brave/compare/5.17.1..5.18.1\">https://github.com/openzipkin/brave/compare/5.17.1..5.18.1</a></p>\n<p>Brave 5.18 prepares for Brave 6 by deprecating instrumentation for libraries not released in 1.5-3.5 years including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>context/rxjava2 - last released Feb 2021\n<ul>\n<li>replaced by RxJava3, but unlikely this module will be ported as it wasn't used widely.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>instrumentation/dubbo-rpc - (alibaba) last released Dec 2021\n<ul>\n<li>replaced by Apache Dubbo instrumentation/dubbo</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>instrumentation/p6spy - last released July 2020\n<ul>\n<li>project dormant</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>instrumentation/sparkjava - last released July 2022\n<ul>\n<li>project dormant</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A minor change is we changed the artifact we use to test MySQL 8 to com.mysql:mysql-connector-j  (instead of mysql:mysql-connector-java), to ensure we validate against current versions.

href=\"https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/io.zipkin.reporter2/zipkin-reporter-brave\">zipkin-reporter-brave</a>, which intentionally has no dependency on that.</p>\n<p>Zipkin Reporter 3.0.0 makes the <a href=\"https://central.sonatype.com/search?q=io.zipkin.zipkin2%3Azipkin\">io.zipkin.zipkin2:zipkin</a> dependency of <a href=\"https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:io.zipkin.reporter2%20AND%20a:zipkin-reporter-brave\">io.zipkin.reporter2:zipkin-reporter-brave</a> optional. This means those using the <code>AsyncZipkinSpanHandler</code> will have no dependencies except any sender they configure. In particular, this allows those using Brave for things besides zipkin (e.g. wavefront) to avoid a dependency.

href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/releases\">io.zipkin.reporter2:zipkin-sender-okhttp3's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Zipkin Reporter 3.0.0 makes the <a href=\"https://central.sonatype.com/search?q=io.zipkin.zipkin2%3Azipkin\">io.zipkin.zipkin2:zipkin</a> dependency of <a href=\"https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:io.zipkin.reporter2%20AND%20a:zipkin-reporter-brave\">io.zipkin.reporter2:zipkin-reporter-brave</a> optional. This means those using the <code>AsyncZipkinSpanHandler</code> will have no dependencies except any sender they configure. In particular, this allows those using Brave for things besides zipkin (e.g. wavefront) to avoid a dependency. Also, those sending spans zipkin have simpler dependency configuration and save a couple hundred KB, as well.</p>\n<p>Those using types from the core <a href=\"https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:io.zipkin.reporter2%20AND%20a:zipkin-reporter\">io.zipkin.reporter2:zipkin-reporter</a> artifact should depend on this directly, possibly using <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java#version-alignments\">our bom</a> to align deps. <code>io.zipkin.reporter2:zipkin-reporter</code> still defaults to depend on <code>io.zipkin.zipkin2:zipkin</code>, but it can be excluded if you know what you are doing.</p>\n<p>Technically, some base classes to accommodate this, but they don't have affect on call sites except those implementing a custom <code>Reporter</code> or <code>Sender</code>. Due to these type changes, this is a major version change. However, must users will have a drop-in experience, except possibly dependency configuration changes.</p>\n<p>Thanks a lot to <a href=\"https://github.com/anuraaga\"><code>@​anuraaga</code></a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/reta\"><code>@​reta</code></a> who helped think through this!</p>\n<h2>Zipkin Reporter 2.17.2</h2>\n<p>Zipkin Reporter v2.17.2 fixes a bug where the jars that should be at Java 1.6 or 1.7 bytecode were not.</p>\n<p><strong>Full Changelog</strong>: <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/compare/2.17.0..2.17.2\">https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/compare/2.17.0..2.17.2</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Changelog</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/blob/master/RELEASE.md\">io.zipkin.reporter2:zipkin-sender-okhttp3's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h1>OpenZipkin Release Process</h1>\n<p>This repo uses semantic versions. Please keep this in mind when choosing version numbers.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Alert others you are releasing</strong></p>\n<p>There should be no commits made to master while the release is in progress (about 10 minutes). Before you start\na release, alert others on <a href=\"https://gitter.im/openzipkin/zipkin\">gitter</a> so that they don't accidentally merge\nanything. If they do, and the build fails because of that, you'll have to recreate the release tag described below.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Push a git tag</strong></p>\n<p>The trigger format is <code>release-MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH</code>, ex <code>git tag release-1.18.1 &amp;&amp; git push origin release-1.18.1</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Wait for CI</strong></p>\n<p>The <code>release-MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH</code> tag triggers <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/blob/master/build-bin/maven/maven_release\"><code>https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/blob/master/build-bin/maven/maven_release</code></a>,\nwhich creates commits, <code>MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH</code> tag, and increments the version (maven-release-plugin).</p>\n<p>The <code>MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH</code> tag triggers <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/blob/master/build-bin/deploy\"><code>https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/blob/master/build-bin/deploy</code></a>, which does the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Publishes jars to <a href=\"https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases\">https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/blob/master/build-bin/maven/maven_deploy\"><code>https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/blob/master/build-bin/maven/maven_deploy</code></a>\n<ul>\n<li>Later, the same jars synchronize to Maven Central</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Notes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://search.maven.org/\">https://search.maven.org/</a> index will take longer than direct links like <a href=\"https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/zipkin\">https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/zipkin</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Credentials</h2>\n<p>The release process uses various credentials. If you notice something failing due to unauthorized,\nlook at the notes in [.github/workflows/deploy.yml] and check the <a href=\"https://github.com/organizations/openzipkin/settings/secrets/actions\">org secrets</a>.</p>\n<h3>Troubleshooting invalid credentials</h3>\n<p>If you receive a '401 unauthorized' failure from OSSRH, it is likely\n<code>SONATYPE_USER</code> or <code>SONATYPE_PASSWORD</code> entries are invalid, or possibly the\nuser associated with them does not have rights to upload.</p>\n<p>The least destructive test is to try to publish a snapshot manually. By passing\nthe values CI would use, you can kick off a snapshot from your laptop. This\nis a good way to validate that your unencrypted credentials are authorized.</p>\n<p>Here's an example of a snapshot deploy with specified credentials.</p>\n<pre lang=\"bash\"><code>$ export GPG_TTY=$(tty) &amp;&amp; GPG_PASSPHRASE=whackamole SONATYPE_USER=adrianmole SONATYPE_PASSWORD=ed6f20bde9123bbb2312b221 build-bin/build-bin/maven/maven_deploy\n</code></pre>\n<h2>First release of the year</h2>\n<p>The license plugin verifies license headers of files include a copyright notice indicating the years a file was affected.\nThis information is taken from git history.

href=\"https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:io.zipkin.reporter2%20AND%20a:zipkin-reporter-brave\">io.zipkin.reporter2:zipkin-reporter-brave</a> optional. This means those using the <code>AsyncZipkinSpanHandler</code> will have no dependencies except any sender they configure. In particular, this allows those using Brave for things besides zipkin (e.g. wavefront) to avoid a dependency. Also, those sending spans zipkin have simpler dependency configuration and save a couple hundred KB, as well.</p>\n<p>Those using types from the core <a href=\"https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:io.zipkin.reporter2%20AND%20a:zipkin-reporter\">io.zipkin.reporter2:zipkin-reporter</a> artifact should depend on this directly, possibly using <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java#version-alignments\">our bom</a> to align deps. <code>io.zipkin.reporter2:zipkin-reporter</code> still defaults to depend on <code>io.zipkin.zipkin2:zipkin</code>, but it can be excluded if you know what you are doing.</p>\n<p>Technically, some base classes to accommodate this, but they don't have affect on call sites except those implementing a custom <code>Reporter</code> or <code>Sender</code>. Due to these type changes, this is a major version change. However, must users will have a drop-in experience, except possibly dependency configuration changes.</p>\n<p>Thanks a lot to <a href=\"https://github.com/anuraaga\"><code>@​anuraaga</code></a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/reta\"><code>@​reta</code></a> who helped think through this!</p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Changelog</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/blob/master/RELEASE.md\">io.zipkin.reporter2:zipkin-reporter-brave's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h1>OpenZipkin Release Process</h1>\n<p>This repo uses semantic versions.

This means those using the <code>AsyncZipkinSpanHandler</code> will have no dependencies except any sender they configure. In particular, this allows those using Brave for things besides zipkin (e.g. wavefront) to avoid a dependency. Also, those sending spans zipkin have simpler dependency configuration and save a couple hundred KB, as well.</p>\n<p>Those using types from the core <a href=\"https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:io.zipkin.reporter2%20AND%20a:zipkin-reporter\">io.zipkin.reporter2:zipkin-reporter</a> artifact should depend on this directly, possibly using <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java#version-alignments\">our bom</a> to align deps. <code>io.zipkin.reporter2:zipkin-reporter</code> still defaults to depend on <code>io.zipkin.zipkin2:zipkin</code>, but it can be excluded if you know what you are doing.</p>\n<p>Technically, some base classes to accommodate this, but they don't have affect on call sites except those implementing a custom <code>Reporter</code> or <code>Sender</code>. Due to these type changes, this is a major version change. However, must users will have a drop-in experience, except possibly dependency configuration changes.</p>\n<p>Thanks a lot to <a href=\"https://github.com/anuraaga\"><code>@​anuraaga</code></a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/reta\"><code>@​reta</code></a> who helped think through this!</p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Changelog</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/blob/master/RELEASE.md\">io.zipkin.reporter2:zipkin-sender-urlconnection's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h1>OpenZipkin Release Process</h1>\n<p>This repo uses semantic versions.

[io.zipkin.reporter2:zipkin-sender-okhttp3](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java) from 2.16.4 to 2.17.1.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/releases\">io.zipkin.reporter2:zipkin-sender-okhttp3's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Zipkin Reporter 2.17.0</h2>\n<p>Zipkin Reporter v2.17.0 updates default versions of dependencies so that CVE scanners like <a href=\"https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/latest/\">trivy</a> pass by default. Details below for the interested.</p>\n<p>For example, trivy is now clean.</p>\n<pre><code>$ trivy -q --skip-files &quot;**/src/it/*/pom.xml&quot; repo https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java\n</code></pre>\n<p>In order to do this, and based on user demand, we had to change some default practice in our senders (the transport plug-in for sending spans to a zipkin compatible endpoint). Here is a summary of each and how versions are handled.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/tree/master/activemq-client\">activemq-client</a> - Note that the recently released 6.x version is not compatible with 5.x due to package import change from javax.jms to jakarta.jms. Raise an issue if you need a later client as it will require a copy of the entire module to resolve.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/tree/master/amqp-client\">amqp-client</a>  (rabbitmq) - The 4.x version is no longer maintained, so we set a 5.x version and test the old one.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/tree/master/kafka\">kafka</a> - the kafka-clients driver has not had any known compatibility problems, so we've left it as-is.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/tree/master/libthrift\">libthrift</a> (scribe) - libthrift (used for the deprecated scribe transport) has never released a 1.0 version, so occasionally causes revlocks. <a href=\"https://github.com/zhfeng\"><code>@​zhfeng</code></a> noticed this in apache camel, as updating past the 4 year old 0.13 was impossible to work around. Luckily versions after that seem compatible with each other.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/tree/master/okhttp3\">okhttp3</a> - The 3.x version is no longer maintained, so we set a 4.x version and test the old one. Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/evantorrie\"><code>@​evantorrie</code></a> for explaining why this is important and <a href=\"https://github.com/shakuzen\"><code>@​shakuzen</code></a> for helping in the discussion.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While not end-user affecting, we have also <a href=\"https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite-docs/blob/master/running-recipes/popular-recipe-guides/migrate-from-junit-4-to-junit-5.md\">migrated from JUnit 4 to JUnit 5</a>, thanks to OpenRewrite recipes from <a href=\"https://github.com/TeamModerne\"><code>@​TeamModerne</code></a>. Also, we use docker images to test all messaging transports. This ensures compatibility with upstream in transparent ways, and also removes classpath conflicts from java-based messaging transports such as ActiveMQ and Kafka.</p>\n<p>Thanks a lot to <a href=\"https://github.com/anuraaga\"><code>@​anuraaga</code></a> for copious support work on this release, as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Full Changelog</strong>: <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/compare/2.16.5...2.17.0\">https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/compare/2.16.5...2.17.0</a></p>\n<p>Note: To pass Trivy at the moment, we have to skip old versions used only for compatibility testing. There is a <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/issues/228\">discussion</a> about making this default.</p>\n<h2>Zipkin Reporter 2.16.5</h2>\n<p>Zipkin Reporter v2.16.5 updates dependencies and moves the build to work on current LTS JDKs (11, 17 and 21). Runtime Java versions remain the same. For example, the minimum Java version of the core jar remains 1.6.</p>\n<p><strong>Full Changelog</strong>: <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/compare/2.16.4...2.16.5\">https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/compare/2.16.4...2.16.5</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Changelog</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/blob/master/RELEASE.md\">io.zipkin.reporter2:zipkin-sender-okhttp3's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h1>OpenZipkin Release Process</h1>\n<p>This repo uses semantic versions. Please keep this in mind when choosing version numbers.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Alert others you are releasing</strong></p>\n<p>There should be no commits made to master while the release is in progress (about 10 minutes). Before you start\na release, alert others on <a href=\"https://gitter.im/openzipkin/zipkin\">gitter</a> so that they don't accidentally merge\nanything. If they do, and the build fails because of that, you'll have to recreate the release tag described below.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Push a git tag</strong></p>\n<p>The trigger format is <code>release-MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH</code>, ex <code>git tag release-1.18.1 &amp;&amp; git push origin release-1.18.1</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Wait for CI</strong></p>\n<p>The <code>release-MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH</code> tag triggers <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/blob/master/build-bin/maven/maven_release\"><code>https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/blob/master/build-bin/maven/maven_release</code></a>,\nwhich creates commits, <code>MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH</code> tag, and increments the version (maven-release-plugin).</p>\n<p>The <code>MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH</code> tag triggers <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/blob/master/build-bin/deploy\"><code>https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/blob/master/build-bin/deploy</code></a>, which does the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Publishes jars to <a href=\"https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases\">https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/blob/master/build-bin/maven/maven_deploy\"><code>https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/blob/master/build-bin/maven/maven_deploy</code></a>\n<ul>\n<li>Later, the same jars synchronize to Maven Central</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Notes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://search.maven.org/\">https://search.maven.org/</a> index will take longer than direct links like <a href=\"https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/zipkin\">https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/zipkin</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Credentials</h2>\n<p>The release process uses various credentials. If you notice something failing due to unauthorized,\nlook at the notes in [.github/workflows/deploy.yml] and check the <a href=\"https://github.com/organizations/openzipkin/settings/secrets/actions\">org secrets</a>.</p>\n<h3>Troubleshooting invalid credentials</h3>\n<p>If you receive a '401 unauthorized' failure from OSSRH, it is likely\n<code>SONATYPE_USER</code> or <code>SONATYPE_PASSWORD</code> entries are invalid, or possibly the\nuser associated with them does not have rights to upload.</p>\n<p>The least destructive test is to try to publish a snapshot manually. By passing\nthe values CI would use, you can kick off a snapshot from your laptop.

versions. Please keep this in mind when choosing version numbers.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Alert others you are releasing</strong></p>\n<p>There should be no commits made to master while the release is in progress (about 10 minutes). Before you start\na release, alert others on <a href=\"https://gitter.im/openzipkin/zipkin\">gitter</a> so that they don't accidentally merge\nanything. If they do, and the build fails because of that, you'll have to recreate the release tag described below.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Push a git tag</strong></p>\n<p>The trigger format is <code>release-MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH</code>, ex <code>git tag release-1.18.1 &amp;&amp; git push origin release-1.18.1</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Wait for CI</strong></p>\n<p>The <code>release-MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH</code> tag triggers <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/brave/blob/master/build-bin/maven/maven_release\"><code>https://github.com/openzipkin/brave/blob/master/build-bin/maven/maven_release</code></a>,\nwhich creates commits, <code>MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH</code> tag, and increments the version (maven-release-plugin).</p>\n<p>The <code>MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH</code> tag triggers <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/brave/blob/master/build-bin/deploy\"><code>https://github.com/openzipkin/brave/blob/master/build-bin/deploy</code></a>, which does the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Publishes jars to <a href=\"https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases\">https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/brave/blob/master/build-bin/maven/maven_deploy\"><code>https://github.com/openzipkin/brave/blob/master/build-bin/maven/maven_deploy</code></a>\n<ul>\n<li>Later, the same jars synchronize to Maven Central</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Publishes Javadoc to <a href=\"https://zipkin.io/brave\">https://zipkin.io/brave</a> into a versioned subdirectory</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Notes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://search.maven.org/\">https://search.maven.org/</a> index will take longer than direct links like <a href=\"https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/zipkin\">https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/zipkin</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Credentials</h2>\n<p>The release process uses various credentials. If you notice something failing due to unauthorized,\nlook at the notes in [.github/workflows/deploy.yml] and check the <a href=\"https://github.com/organizations/openzipkin/settings/secrets/actions\">org secrets</a>.</p>\n<h3>Troubleshooting invalid credentials</h3>\n<p>If you receive a '401 unauthorized' failure from OSSRH, it is likely\n<code>SONATYPE_USER</code> or <code>SONATYPE_PASSWORD</code> entries are invalid, or possibly the\nuser associated with them does not have rights to upload.</p>\n<p>The least destructive test is to try to publish a snapshot manually. By passing\nthe values CI would use, you can kick off a snapshot from your laptop. This\nis a good way to validate that your unencrypted credentials are authorized.</p>\n<p>Here's an example of a snapshot deploy with specified credentials.</p>\n<pre lang=\"bash\"><code>$ export GPG_TTY=$(tty) &amp;&amp; GPG_PASSPHRASE=whackamole SONATYPE_USER=adrianmole SONATYPE_PASSWORD=ed6f20bde9123bbb2312b221 build-bin/build-bin/maven/maven_deploy\n</code></pre>\n<h2>First release of the year</h2>\n<p>The license plugin verifies license headers of files include a copyright notice indicating the years a file was affected.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

`cxf.zipkin-reporter.version` from 2.16.5 to 2.17.0.\nUpdates `io.zipkin.reporter2:zipkin-reporter-brave` from 2.16.5 to 2.17.0\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/releases\">io.zipkin.reporter2:zipkin-reporter-brave's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Zipkin Reporter 2.17.0</h2>\n<p>Zipkin Reporter v2.17.0 updates default versions of dependencies so that CVE scanners like <a href=\"https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/latest/\">trivy</a> pass by default. Details below for the interested.</p>\n<p>For example, trivy is now clean.</p>\n<pre><code>$ trivy -q --skip-files &quot;**/src/it/*/pom.xml&quot; repo https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java\n</code></pre>\n<p>In order to do this, and based on user demand, we had to change some default practice in our senders (the transport plug-in for sending spans to a zipkin compatible endpoint). Here is a summary of each and how versions are handled.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/tree/master/activemq-client\">activemq-client</a> - Note that the recently released 6.x version is not compatible with 5.x due to package import change from javax.jms to jakarta.jms. Raise an issue if you need a later client as it will require a copy of the entire module to resolve.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/tree/master/amqp-client\">amqp-client</a>  (rabbitmq) - The 4.x version is no longer maintained, so we set a 5.x version and test the old one.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/tree/master/kafka\">kafka</a> - the kafka-clients driver has not had any known compatibility problems, so we've left it as-is.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/tree/master/libthrift\">libthrift</a> (scribe) - libthrift (used for the deprecated scribe transport) has never released a 1.0 version, so occasionally causes revlocks. <a href=\"https://github.com/zhfeng\"><code>@​zhfeng</code></a> noticed this in apache camel, as updating past the 4 year old 0.13 was impossible to work around. Luckily versions after that seem compatible with each other.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/tree/master/okhttp3\">okhttp3</a> - The 3.x version is no longer maintained, so we set a 4.x version and test the old one. Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/evantorrie\"><code>@​evantorrie</code></a> for explaining why this is important and <a href=\"https://github.com/shakuzen\"><code>@​shakuzen</code></a> for helping in the discussion.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While not end-user affecting, we have also <a href=\"https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite-docs/blob/master/running-recipes/popular-recipe-guides/migrate-from-junit-4-to-junit-5.md\">migrated from JUnit 4 to JUnit 5</a>, thanks to OpenRewrite recipes from <a href=\"https://github.com/TeamModerne\"><code>@​TeamModerne</code></a>. Also, we use docker images to test all messaging transports. This ensures compatibility with upstream in transparent ways, and also removes classpath conflicts from java-based messaging transports such as ActiveMQ and Kafka.</p>\n<p>Thanks a lot to <a href=\"https://github.com/anuraaga\"><code>@​anuraaga</code></a> for copious support work on this release, as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Full Changelog</strong>: <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/compare/2.16.5...2.17.0\">https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/compare/2.16.5...2.17.0</a></p>\n<p>Note: To pass Trivy at the moment, we have to skip old versions used only for compatibility testing. There is a <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/issues/228\">discussion</a> about making this default.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Changelog</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/blob/master/RELEASE.md\">io.zipkin.reporter2:zipkin-reporter-brave's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h1>OpenZipkin Release Process</h1>\n<p>This repo uses semantic versions. Please keep this in mind when choosing version numbers.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Alert others you are releasing</strong></p>\n<p>There should be no commits made to master while the release is in progress (about 10 minutes). Before you start\na release, alert others on <a href=\"https://gitter.im/openzipkin/zipkin\">gitter</a> so that they don't accidentally merge\nanything. If they do, and the build fails because of that, you'll have to recreate the release tag described below.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Push a git tag</strong></p>\n<p>The trigger format is <code>release-MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH</code>, ex <code>git tag release-1.18.1 &amp;&amp; git push origin release-1.18.1</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Wait for CI</strong></p>\n<p>The <code>release-MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH</code> tag triggers <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/blob/master/build-bin/maven/maven_release\"><code>https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/blob/master/build-bin/maven/maven_release</code></a>,\nwhich creates commits, <code>MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH</code> tag, and increments the version (maven-release-plugin).</p>\n<p>The <code>MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH</code> tag triggers <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/blob/master/build-bin/deploy\"><code>https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/blob/master/build-bin/deploy</code></a>, which does the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Publishes jars to <a href=\"https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases\">https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/blob/master/build-bin/maven/maven_deploy\"><code>https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/blob/master/build-bin/maven/maven_deploy</code></a>\n<ul>\n<li>Later, the same jars synchronize to Maven Central</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Notes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://search.maven.org/\">https://search.maven.org/</a> index will take longer than direct links like <a href=\"https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/zipkin\">https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/zipkin</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Credentials</h2>\n<p>The release process uses various credentials. If you notice something failing due to unauthorized,\nlook at the notes in [.github/workflows/deploy.yml] and check the <a href=\"https://github.com/organizations/openzipkin/settings/secrets/actions\">org secrets</a>.</p>\n<h3>Troubleshooting invalid credentials</h3>\n<p>If you receive a '401 unauthorized' failure from OSSRH, it is likely\n<code>SONATYPE_USER</code> or <code>SONATYPE_PASSWORD</code> entries are invalid, or possibly the\nuser associated with them does not have rights to upload.</p>\n<p>The least destructive test is to try to publish a snapshot manually. By passing\nthe values CI would use, you can kick off a snapshot from your laptop.

Details below for the interested.</p>\n<p>For example, trivy is now clean.</p>\n<pre><code>$ trivy -q --skip-files &quot;**/src/it/*/pom.xml&quot; repo https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java\n</code></pre>\n<p>In order to do this, and based on user demand, we had to change some default practice in our senders (the transport plug-in for sending spans to a zipkin compatible endpoint). Here is a summary of each and how versions are handled.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/tree/master/activemq-client\">activemq-client</a> - Note that the recently released 6.x version is not compatible with 5.x due to package import change from javax.jms to jakarta.jms. Raise an issue if you need a later client as it will require a copy of the entire module to resolve.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/tree/master/amqp-client\">amqp-client</a>  (rabbitmq) - The 4.x version is no longer maintained, so we set a 5.x version and test the old one.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/tree/master/kafka\">kafka</a> - the kafka-clients driver has not had any known compatibility problems, so we've left it as-is.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/tree/master/libthrift\">libthrift</a> (scribe) - libthrift (used for the deprecated scribe transport) has never released a 1.0 version, so occasionally causes revlocks. <a href=\"https://github.com/zhfeng\"><code>@​zhfeng</code></a> noticed this in apache camel, as updating past the 4 year old 0.13 was impossible to work around. Luckily versions after that seem compatible with each other.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/tree/master/okhttp3\">okhttp3</a> - The 3.x version is no longer maintained, so we set a 4.x version and test the old one. Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/evantorrie\"><code>@​evantorrie</code></a> for explaining why this is important and <a href=\"https://github.com/shakuzen\"><code>@​shakuzen</code></a> for helping in the discussion.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While not end-user affecting, we have also <a href=\"https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite-docs/blob/master/running-recipes/popular-recipe-guides/migrate-from-junit-4-to-junit-5.md\">migrated from JUnit 4 to JUnit 5</a>, thanks to OpenRewrite recipes from <a href=\"https://github.com/TeamModerne\"><code>@​TeamModerne</code></a>. Also, we use docker images to test all messaging transports. This ensures compatibility with upstream in transparent ways, and also removes classpath conflicts from java-based messaging transports such as ActiveMQ and Kafka.</p>\n<p>Thanks a lot to <a href=\"https://github.com/anuraaga\"><code>@​anuraaga</code></a> for copious support work on this release, as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Full Changelog</strong>: <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/compare/2.16.5...2.17.0\">https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/compare/2.16.5...2.17.0</a></p>\n<p>Note: To pass Trivy at the moment, we have to skip old versions used only for compatibility testing. There is a <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/issues/228\">discussion</a> about making this default.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Changelog</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/blob/master/RELEASE.md\">io.zipkin.reporter2:zipkin-sender-urlconnection's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h1>OpenZipkin Release Process</h1>\n<p>This repo uses semantic versions. Please keep this in mind when choosing version numbers.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Alert others you are releasing</strong></p>\n<p>There should be no commits made to master while the release is in progress (about 10 minutes). Before you start\na release, alert others on <a href=\"https://gitter.im/openzipkin/zipkin\">gitter</a> so that they don't accidentally merge\nanything. If they do, and the build fails because of that, you'll have to recreate the release tag described below.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Push a git tag</strong></p>\n<p>The trigger format is <code>release-MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH</code>, ex <code>git tag release-1.18.1 &amp;&amp; git push origin release-1.18.1</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Wait for CI</strong></p>\n<p>The <code>release-MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH</code> tag triggers <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/blob/master/build-bin/maven/maven_release\"><code>https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/blob/master/build-bin/maven/maven_release</code></a>,\nwhich creates commits, <code>MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH</code> tag, and increments the version (maven-release-plugin).</p>\n<p>The <code>MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH</code> tag triggers <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/blob/master/build-bin/deploy\"><code>https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/blob/master/build-bin/deploy</code></a>, which does the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Publishes jars to <a href=\"https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases\">https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/blob/master/build-bin/maven/maven_deploy\"><code>https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/blob/master/build-bin/maven/maven_deploy</code></a>\n<ul>\n<li>Later, the same jars synchronize to Maven Central</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Notes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://search.maven.org/\">https://search.maven.org/</a> index will take longer than direct links like <a href=\"https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/zipkin\">https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/zipkin</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Credentials</h2>\n<p>The release process uses various credentials. If you notice something failing due to unauthorized,\nlook at the notes in [.github/workflows/deploy.yml] and check the <a href=\"https://github.com/organizations/openzipkin/settings/secrets/actions\">org secrets</a>.</p>\n<h3>Troubleshooting invalid credentials</h3>\n<p>If you receive a '401 unauthorized' failure from OSSRH, it is likely\n<code>SONATYPE_USER</code> or <code>SONATYPE_PASSWORD</code> entries are invalid, or possibly the\nuser associated with them does not have rights to upload.</p>\n<p>The least destructive test is to try to publish a snapshot manually. By passing\nthe values CI would use, you can kick off a snapshot from your laptop. This\nis a good way to validate that your unencrypted credentials are authorized.</p>\n<p>Here's an example of a snapshot deploy with specified credentials.</p>\n<pre lang=\"bash\"><code>$ export GPG_TTY=$(tty) &amp;&amp; GPG_PASSPHRASE=whackamole SONATYPE_USER=adrianmole SONATYPE_PASSWORD=ed6f20bde9123bbb2312b221 build-bin/build-bin/maven/maven_deploy\n</code></pre>\n<h2>First release of the year</h2>\n<p>The license plugin verifies license headers of files include a copyright notice indicating the years a file was affected.\nThis information is taken from git history.
