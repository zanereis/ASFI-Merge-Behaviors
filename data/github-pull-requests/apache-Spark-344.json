This change adds a call to `dropTempView()` that deletes this temporary table before returning the result so that the table will not remain in spark's table catalog. Because `tableName` is randomized and not exposed, there should be no expected use of this table outside of the `transform` method.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nA single new assertion was added to the existing test of the `SQLTransformer.transform` method that all temporary tables are removed. Without the corresponding code change, this new assertion fails. I am not aware of any circumstances in which removing this temporary view would be bad for performance or correctness in other ways, but some expertise here would be helpful.\n","created_at":"2016-10-18T04:56:45Z","updated_at":"2016-10-22T09:01:49Z","closed_at":"2016-10-22T09:01:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"88cc588040099bb32f236abd1c435bca621d4a2f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15526/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15526/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15526/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d5c3b419942f1d3b9af265b540a9404d3e8295df","head":{"label":"drewrobb:SPARK-17986","ref":"SPARK-17986","sha":"d5c3b419942f1d3b9af265b540a9404d3e8295df","user":{"login":"drewrobb","id":140935,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDkzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/140935?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewrobb","html_url":"https://github.com/drewrobb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewrobb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewrobb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewrobb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewrobb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewrobb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewrobb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewrobb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewrobb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewrobb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":36042124,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNjA0MjEyNA==","name":"spark","full_name":"drewrobb/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"drewrobb","id":140935,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDkzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/140935?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewrobb","html_url":"https://github.com/drewrobb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewrobb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewrobb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewrobb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewrobb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewrobb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewrobb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewrobb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewrobb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewrobb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/drewrobb/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nAdd NUMA aware support for Yarn based deployment mode. \nThis patch optimizes the memory allocation, executors are bound to NUMA nodes in round-robin for a worker node so that memory allocation tries local NUMA node firstly and only when there is no enough memory in local NUMA node it tries remote ones. \nBefore this patch, Spark is NUMA unaware in which many remote memory allocations happen and the tremendous remote memory accesses impact performance a lot. We observed significant performance improvement during NUMA aware patch evaluation.\n\nTo Do:\n1. Add support for NUMA node numbers' configuration and make testing.\n2. Add NUMA aware support for Mesos based deployment mode and make testing.\n3. Add NUMA aware support for Standalone deployment mode and make testing.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nWe observed significant performance improvement during evaluation with BigBench. We are still making evaluation and more detailed results will be updated continuously.\n\n**Setup:**\nCluster Topo: 1 Master + 4 Slaves (Spark on Yarn)\nCPU: Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2699 v3 @ 2.30GHz(72 Cores)\nMemory: 128GB(2 NUMA Nodes)\nNIC: 1x10Gb/Sec\nDisk: Write -1.5GB/Sec, Read- 5GB/Sec\nSW Version: Hadoop-5.7.0 + Spark-2.0.0\n## NUMA Introduction\n\nAs below diagram depicts, in UMA(Uniform Memory Access) model, processors share one bus. The contention on bus becomes very heavy when processer scales up. NUMA(Non-Uniform Memory Access) processer has a better scalability by dividing processors and memory blocks into nodes, nodes are interconnected with added bus.\nFor NUMA, the memory accessing to a remote node is much slower than accesing to local one, while, for UMA memory accessing to any nodes is uniform.\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/22884597/19464216/02ebbcb4-952d-11e6-9a0e-28397ae3aa87.png)\n\nFor more NUMA information, please refer to

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWhen `FilterExec` contains `isNotNull`, which could be inferred and pushed down or users specified, we convert the nullability of the involved columns if the top-layer expression is null-intolerant. However, this is not correct, if the top-layer expression is not a leaf expression, it could still tolerate the null when it has null-tolerant child expressions. \n\nFor example, `cast(coalesce(a#5, a#15) as double)`. Although `cast` is a null-intolerant expression, but obviously`coalesce` is null-tolerant. Thus, it could eat null.\n\nWhen the nullability is wrong, we could generate incorrect results in different cases. For example, \n\n``` Scala\n    val df1 = Seq((1, 2), (2, 3)).toDF(\"a\", \"b\")\n    val df2 = Seq((2, 5), (3, 4)).toDF(\"a\", \"c\")\n    val joinedDf = df1.join(df2, Seq(\"a\"), \"outer\").na.fill(0)\n    val df3 = Seq((3, 1)).toDF(\"a\", \"d\")\n    joinedDf.join(df3, \"a\").show\n```\n\nThe optimized plan is like \n\n```\nProject [a#29, b#30, c#31, d#42]\n+- Join Inner, (a#29 = a#41)\n   :- Project [cast(coalesce(cast(coalesce(a#5, a#15) as double), 0.0) as int) AS a#29, cast(coalesce(cast(b#6 as double), 0.0) as int) AS b#30, cast(coalesce(cast(c#16 as double), 0.0) as int) AS c#31]\n   :  +- Filter isnotnull(cast(coalesce(cast(coalesce(a#5, a#15) as double), 0.0) as int))\n   :     +- Join FullOuter, (a#5 = a#15)\n   :        :- LocalRelation [a#5, b#6]\n   :        +- LocalRelation [a#15, c#16]\n   +- LocalRelation [a#41, d#42]\n```\n\nWithout the fix, it returns an empty result. With the fix, it can return a correct answer:\n\n```\n+---+---+---+---+\n|  a|  b|  c|  d|\n+---+---+---+---+\n|  3|  0|  4|  1|\n+---+---+---+---+\n```\n### How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded test cases to verify the nullability changes in FilterExec. Also added a test case for verifying the reported incorrect result.\n","created_at":"2016-10-17T23:47:05Z","updated_at":"2016-11-03T16:45:55Z","closed_at":"2016-11-03T15:38:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fc8cff6c4905930af601a60fdb6b6b68e2d8406c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15523/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15523/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15523/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2364cc292e0f6585a4647225446b1044c723908c","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:nullabilityFilterExec","ref":"nullabilityFilterExec","sha":"2364cc292e0f6585a4647225446b1044c723908c","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThere was a bug introduced in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/14690 which broke refreshByPath with converted hive tables (though, it turns out it was very difficult to refresh converted hive tables anyways, since you had to specify the exact path of one of the partitions).\n\nThis changes refreshByPath to invalidate by prefix instead of exact match, and fixes the issue.\n\ncc @sameeragarwal for refreshByPath changes\n@mallman \n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExtended unit

work has largely been done by @lw-lin in his PR #15497. This is a slight refactoring of it.\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThere were two sources of flakiness in StreamingQueryListener test.\n- When testing with manual clock, consecutive attempts to advance the clock can occur without the stream execution thread being unblocked and doing some work between the two attempts. Hence the following can happen with the current ManualClock.\n\n```\n+-----------------------------------+--------------------------------+\n|      StreamExecution thread       |         testing thread         |\n+-----------------------------------+--------------------------------+\n|  ManualClock.waitTillTime(100) {  |                                |\n|        _isWaiting = true          |                                |\n|            wait(10)               |                                |\n|        still in wait(10)          |  if (_isWaiting) advance(100)  |\n|        still in wait(10)          |  if (_isWaiting) advance(200)  | <- this should be disallowed !\n|        still in wait(10)          |  if (_isWaiting) advance(300)  | <- this should be disallowed !\n|      wake up from wait(10)        |                                |\n|       current time is 600         |                                |\n|       _isWaiting = false          |                                |\n|  }                                |                                |\n+-----------------------------------+--------------------------------+\n```\n- Second source of flakiness is that the adding data to memory stream may get processing in any trigger, not just the first trigger.\n\nMy fix is to make the manual clock wait for the other stream execution thread to start waiting for the clock at the right wait start time. That is, `advance(200)` (see above) will wait for stream execution thread to complete the wait that started at time 0, and start a new wait at time 200 (i.e. time stamp after the previous `advance(100)`).\n\nIn addition, since this is a feature that is solely used by StreamExecution, I removed all the non-generic code from ManualClock and put them in StreamManualClock inside StreamTest.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nRan existing unit test MANY TIME in Jenkins\n","created_at":"2016-10-17T21:01:58Z","updated_at":"2016-10-18T07:52:18Z","closed_at":"2016-10-18T07:52:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a64a1cf7d425523a5a8b885d8da07f03af34c1cb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15519/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15519/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15519/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/322909522d3a4af774fb955b823a03f4a13aa48f","head":{"label":"tdas:metrics-flaky-test-fix","ref":"metrics-flaky-test-fix","sha":"322909522d3a4af774fb955b823a03f4a13aa48f","user":{"login":"tdas","id":663212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17603343,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzYwMzM0Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"tdas/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tdas","id":663212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tdas/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\n(This PR is based on a PoC branch authored by @clockfly.)\n\nIterative ML code may easily create query plans that grow exponentially. We found that query planning time also increases exponentially even when all the sub-plan trees are cached.\n\nThe following snippet illustrates the problem:\n\n``` scala\n(0 until 6).foldLeft(Seq(1, 2, 3).toDS) { (plan, iteration) =>\n  val start = System.currentTimeMillis()\n  val result = plan.join(plan, \"value\").join(plan, \"value\").join(plan, \"value\").join(plan, \"value\")\n  result.cache()\n  System.out.println(s\"Iteration $iteration takes time ${System.currentTimeMillis() - start} ms\")\n  result.as[Int]\n}\n\n// Iteration 0 takes time 9 ms\n// Iteration 1 takes time 19 ms\n// Iteration 2 takes time 61 ms\n// Iteration 3 takes time 219 ms\n// Iteration 4 takes time 830 ms\n// Iteration 5 takes time 4080 ms\n```\n\nThis is because when building a new Dataset, the new plan is always built upon `QueryExecution.analyzed`, which doesn't leverage existing cached plans. This PR tries to fix this issue by building new Datasets upon `QueryExecution.withCachedData` to leverage cached plans and avoid super slow query planning.\n\nHere is the result of running 1,000 iterations using the same posted above after applying this PR:\n\n```\nIteration 0 takes time 10 ms\nIteration 1 takes time 48 ms\nIteration 2 takes time 39 ms\nIteration 3 takes time 56 ms\nIteration 4 takes time 43 ms\nIteration 5 takes time 36 ms\nIteration 6 takes time 43 ms\nIteration 7 takes time 44 ms\nIteration 8 takes time 38 ms\nIteration 9 takes time 42 ms\n...\nIteration 990 takes time 207 ms\nIteration 991 takes time 187 ms\nIteration 992 takes time 223 ms\nIteration 993 takes time 220 ms\nIteration 994 takes time 231 ms\nIteration 995 takes time 211 ms\nIteration 996 takes time 216 ms\nIteration 997 takes time 199 ms\nIteration 998 takes time 209 ms\nIteration 999 takes time 202 ms\n```\n\nQuery planning time slows down much more slowly. This is mostly because cache manager query lookup slows down as entries stored in the cache manager grows. \n\nMany thanks to @clockfly, who investigated this issue and made an initial PoC.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting tests.\n","created_at":"2016-10-17T18:13:01Z","updated_at":"2016-10-22T14:11:05Z","closed_at":"2016-10-21T23:34:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"12761ff4b0061d61474eac32f750bdf04db834f2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15517/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15517/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15517/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/fffbd69ac0b568f01a5d0d7a90b8f1aed38ba5e0","head":{"label":"liancheng:fix-slow-planning","ref":"fix-slow-planning","sha":"fffbd69ac0b568f01a5d0d7a90b8f1aed38ba5e0","user":{"login":"liancheng","id":230655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng","html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17232535,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzMjUzNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"liancheng/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"liancheng","id":230655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng","html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWe should follow hive table and also store partition spec in metastore for data source table.\nThis brings 2 benefits:\n1. It's more flexible to manage the table data files, as users can use `ADD PARTITION`, `DROP PARTITION` and `RENAME PARTITION`\n2. We don't need to cache all file status for data source table anymore.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nexisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR proposes to change the documentation for functions.\n\nThe changes include\n- Re-indent the documentation\n- Add examples/arguments in `extended` where the arguments are multiple or specific format (e.g. xml/ json).\n\nFor examples, the documentation was updated as below:\n### Functions with single line usage\n\n**Before**\n- `pow`\n  \n  ``` sql\n  Usage: pow(x1, x2) - Raise x1 to the power of x2.\n  Extended Usage:\n  > SELECT pow(2, 3);\n   8.0\n  ```\n- `current_timestamp`\n  \n  ``` sql\n  Usage: current_timestamp() - Returns the current timestamp at the start of query evaluation.\n  Extended Usage:\n  No example for current_timestamp.\n  ```\n\n**After**\n- `pow`\n  \n  ``` sql\n  Usage: pow(expr1, expr2) - Raise expr1 to the power of expr2.\n  Extended Usage:\n      Arguments:\n        expr1 - a numeric expression.\n        expr2 - a numeric expression.\n  \n      Examples:\n        > SELECT pow(2, 3);\n         8.0\n  ```\n- `current_timestamp`\n  \n  ``` sql\n  Usage: current_timestamp() - Returns the current timestamp at the start of query evaluation.\n  Extended Usage:\n      No example/arguemnt for current_timestamp.\n  ```\n### Functions with (already) multiple line usage\n\n**Before**\n- `approx_count_distinct`\n  \n  ``` sql\n  Usage: approx_count_distinct(expr) - Returns the estimated cardinality by HyperLogLog++.\n      approx_count_distinct(expr, relativeSD=0.05) - Returns the estimated cardinality by HyperLogLog++\n        with relativeSD, the maximum estimation error allowed.\n  \n  Extended Usage:\n  No example for approx_count_distinct.\n  ```\n- `percentile_approx`\n  \n  ``` sql\n  Usage:\n        percentile_approx(col, percentage [, accuracy]) - Returns the approximate percentile value of numeric\n        column `col` at the given percentage. The value of percentage must be between 0.0\n        and 1.0. The `accuracy` parameter (default: 10000) is a positive integer literal which\n        controls approximation accuracy at the cost of memory. Higher value of `accuracy` yields\n        better accuracy, `1.0/accuracy` is the relative error of the approximation.\n  \n        percentile_approx(col, array(percentage1 [, percentage2]...) [, accuracy]) - Returns the approximate\n        percentile array of column `col` at the given percentage array. Each value of the\n        percentage array must be between 0.0 and 1.0. The `accuracy` parameter (default: 10000) is\n        a positive integer literal which controls approximation accuracy at the cost of memory.\n        Higher value of `accuracy` yields better accuracy, `1.0/accuracy` is the relative error of\n        the approximation.\n  \n  Extended Usage:\n  No example for percentile_approx.\n  ```\n\n**After**\n- `approx_count_distinct`\n  \n  ``` sql\n  Usage:\n      approx_count_distinct(expr[, relativeSD]) - Returns the estimated cardinality by HyperLogLog++.\n        relativeSD defines the maximum estimation error allowed.\n  \n  Extended Usage:\n      Arguments:\n        expr - an expression of any type that represents data to count.\n        relativeSD - a numeric literal that defines the maximum estimation error allowed.\n  ```\n- `percentile_approx`\n  \n  ``` sql\n  Usage:\n      percentile_approx(col, percentage [, accuracy]) - Returns the approximate percentile value of numeric\n        column `col` at the given percentage.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThe python example for tf_idf with the parameter \"minDocFreq\" is not properly set up because the same variable is used to transform the document for both with and without the \"minDocFreq\" parameter.\nThe IDF(minDocFreq=2) is stored in the variable \"idfIgnore\" but then it is the original variable \"idf\" used to transform the \"tf\" instead of the \"idfIgnore\".\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nBefore the results for \"tfidf\" and \"tfidfIgnore\" were the same:\ntfidf:\n(1048576,[1046921],[3.75828890549])\n(1048576,[1046920],[3.75828890549])\n(1048576,[1046923],[3.75828890549])\n(1048576,[892732],[3.75828890549])\n(1048576,[892733],[3.75828890549])\n(1048576,[892734],[3.75828890549])\ntfidfIgnore:\n(1048576,[1046921],[3.75828890549])\n(1048576,[1046920],[3.75828890549])\n(1048576,[1046923],[3.75828890549])\n(1048576,[892732],[3.75828890549])\n(1048576,[892733],[3.75828890549])\n(1048576,[892734],[3.75828890549])\n\nAfter

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR is to backport https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/15048 and https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/15459. \n\nHowever, in 2.0, we do not have a unified logical node `CreateTable` and the analyzer rule `PreWriteCheck` is also different. To minimize the code changes, this PR adds a new rule `AnalyzeCreateTableAsSelect`. Please treat it as a new PR to review. Thanks!\n\nAs explained in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/14797:\n\n> Some analyzer rules have assumptions on logical plans, optimizer may break these assumption, we should not pass an optimized query plan into QueryExecution (will be analyzed again), otherwise we may some weird bugs.\n> For example, we have a rule for decimal calculation to promote the precision before binary operations, use PromotePrecision as placeholder to indicate that this rule should not apply twice. But a Optimizer rule will remove this placeholder, that break the assumption, then the rule applied twice, cause wrong result.\n\nWe should not optimize the query in CTAS more than once. For example, \n\n``` Scala\nspark.range(99, 101).createOrReplaceTempView(\"tab1\")\nval sqlStmt = \"SELECT id, cast(id as long) * cast('1.0' as decimal(38, 18)) as num FROM tab1\"\nsql(s\"CREATE TABLE tab2 USING PARQUET AS $sqlStmt\")\ncheckAnswer(spark.table(\"tab2\"), sql(sqlStmt))\n```\n\nBefore this PR, the results do not match\n\n```\n== Results ==\n!== Correct Answer - 2 ==       == Spark Answer - 2 ==\n![100,100.000000000000000000]   [100,null]\n [99,99.000000000000000000]     [99,99.000000000000000000]\n```\n\nAfter this PR, the results match.\n\n```\n+---+----------------------+\n|id |num                   |\n+---+----------------------+\n|99 |99.000000000000000000 |\n|100|100.000000000000000000|\n+---+----------------------+\n```\n\nIn this PR, we do not treat the `query` in CTAS as a child. Thus, the `query` will not be optimized when optimizing CTAS statement. However, we still need to analyze it for normalizing and verifying the CTAS in the Analyzer. Thus, we do it in the analyzer rule `PreprocessDDL`, because so far only this rule needs the analyzed plan of the `query`.\n### How was this patch tested?\n","created_at":"2016-10-15T15:22:44Z","updated_at":"2016-10-17T07:35:54Z","closed_at":"2016-10-17T07:35:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b1b9975e18d3b8ba0755088987ecf63c5c8f2654","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15502/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15502/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15502/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9cfebc523e4b88c3df3ffae8ca5ea92e98a0a616","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:ctasOptimize2.0","ref":"ctasOptimize2.0","sha":"9cfebc523e4b88c3df3ffae8ca5ea92e98a0a616","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently `ProjectExec` simply takes child plan's `outputOrdering` as its `outputOrdering`. In some cases, this might lead to incorrect `outputOrdering`. This argument applies to `TakeOrderedAndProjectExec` too.\n\nFor example, if a plan has output ['a, 'b, 'c], and sort order ['a.asc, 'b.asc, 'c.asc]. After a projection ['b, 'c], the output attribute 'a is not existing now. Then the original sort order ['a.asc, 'b.asc, 'c.asc] is not correct for the projection.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nJenkins tests.\n\nPlease review

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\n`StreamingQueryListenerSuite #test(s\"single listener, check trigger statuses\")` is flaky; the following is one possible flaky

once** when there's some thread -- e.g. `StreamExecution` -- is `still in wait(10)`. In other words, we do not want to `advance()` \"too early\" -- in this sense, this is a follow-up to SPARK-16002.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nRan the flaky test for 1000 times, and all passed.\n","created_at":"2016-10-15T02:39:27Z","updated_at":"2016-10-18T07:38:10Z","closed_at":"2016-10-18T02:07:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b85bc6ad847dc57a38b334d6a210822a45c930d8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15497/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15497/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15497/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7ae7782cdede0c3f2a3db0a09401cf0d682a264f","head":{"label":"lw-lin:metrics-flaky-test","ref":"metrics-flaky-test","sha":"7ae7782cdede0c3f2a3db0a09401cf0d682a264f","user":{"login":"lw-lin","id":15843379,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODQzMzc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15843379?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/lw-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":49997538,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0OTk5NzUzOA==","name":"spark","full_name":"lw-lin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lw-lin","id":15843379,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODQzMzc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15843379?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/lw-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lw-lin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lw-lin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nSimply added the `__getattr__` to SparseVector that DenseVector has, but calls to a SciPy sparse representation instead of storing a vector all the time in self.array\n\nThis allows for use of functions on the values of an entire SparseVector in the same direct way that users interact with DenseVectors.\n i.e. you can simply call SparseVector.mean() to average the values in the entire vector.\n\nNote: The functions do have a slight bit of variance due to calling SciPy and not NumPy. However, the majority of useful functions (sums, means, max, etc.) are available to both packages anyways.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nManual testing on local machine.\nPassed ./python/run-tests\nNo UI changes.\n","created_at":"2016-10-15T00:07:29Z","updated_at":"2020-01-19T00:06:47Z","closed_at":"2020-01-19T00:06:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f64012e6654ee6f051cfe0302b49a89f4339d0ae","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/ML","name":"ML","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1405803268,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAzMjY4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/MLLIB","name":"MLLIB","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1406590181,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTkwMTgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYSPARK","name":"PYSPARK","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15496/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15496/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15496/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5a919b606c0c09d65224d0cec4fd76ea9a4f73e0","head":{"label":"itg-abby:patch-2","ref":"patch-2","sha":"5a919b606c0c09d65224d0cec4fd76ea9a4f73e0","user":{"login":"itg-abby","id":8840022,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NDAwMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8840022?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/itg-abby","html_url":"https://github.com/itg-abby","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itg-abby/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itg-abby/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itg-abby/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itg-abby/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itg-abby/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itg-abby/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itg-abby/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itg-abby/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itg-abby/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":70856484,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3MDg1NjQ4NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"itg-abby/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"itg-abby","id":8840022,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NDAwMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8840022?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/itg-abby","html_url":"https://github.com/itg-abby","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itg-abby/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itg-abby/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itg-abby/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itg-abby/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itg-abby/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itg-abby/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itg-abby/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itg-abby/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itg-abby/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/itg-abby/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nI've added a method to `ApplicationHistoryProvider` that returns the html paragraph to display when there are no applications. This allows providers other than `FsHistoryProvider` to determine what is printed. The current hard coded text is now moved into `FsHistoryProvider` since it assumed that's what was being used before.\n\nI chose to make the function return html rather than text because the current text block had inline html in it and it allows a new implementation of `ApplicationHistoryProvider` more versatility. I did not see any security issues with this since injecting html here requires implementing `ApplicationHistoryProvider` and can't be done outside of code.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nManual testing and dev/run-tests\n\nNo visible changes to the UI\n","created_at":"2016-10-14T19:27:31Z","updated_at":"2016-10-19T20:05:54Z","closed_at":"2016-10-19T20:04:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5234517db59af92cc83934111215d39b0a61f41a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15490/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15490/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15490/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/62e0f654e3139673ef9e59ec690410f1cfbb2416","head":{"label":"ajbozarth:spark10541","ref":"spark10541","sha":"62e0f654e3139673ef9e59ec690410f1cfbb2416","user":{"login":"ajbozarth","id":13952758,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzOTUyNzU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13952758?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth","html_url":"https://github.com/ajbozarth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":41503793,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MTUwMzc5Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"ajbozarth/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ajbozarth","id":13952758,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzOTUyNzU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13952758?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth","html_url":"https://github.com/ajbozarth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajbozarth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ajbozarth/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThe sample weight testing for logistic regressions is not robust. Logistic regression suite already has many test cases comparing results to R glmnet. Since both libraries support sample weights, we should use sample weights in the test to increase coverage for sample weighting. This patch doesn't really add any code and makes the testing more complete.\n\nAlso fixed some errors with the R code that was referenced in the test suit. Changed `standardization=T` to `standardize=T` since the former is invalid.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting unit tests are modified. No non-test code is touched.\n","created_at":"2016-10-14T15:58:37Z","updated_at":"2016-10-14T20:32:28Z","closed_at":"2016-10-14T20:23:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"db04590427ade80fc21b67b279e9c867846a7766","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15488/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15488/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15488/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/54bb1b5cfd3d0b9914f7667e7b6daca020277158","head":{"label":"sethah:logreg_weight_tests","ref":"logreg_weight_tests","sha":"54bb1b5cfd3d0b9914f7667e7b6daca020277158","user":{"login":"sethah","id":7275795,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNzU3OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7275795?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah","html_url":"https://github.com/sethah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":38016887,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODAxNjg4Nw==","name":"spark","full_name":"sethah/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sethah","id":7275795,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNzU3OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7275795?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah","html_url":"https://github.com/sethah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sethah/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWe generate bitmasks for grouping sets during the parsing process, and use these during analysis. These bitmasks are difficult to work with in practice and have lead to numerous bugs. This PR removes these and use actual sets instead, however we still need to generate these offsets for the grouping_id.\n\nThis PR does the following works:\n1. Replace bitmasks by actual grouping sets durning Parsing/Analysis stage of CUBE/ROLLUP/GROUPING SETS;\n2. Add new testsuite `ResolveGroupingAnalyticsSuite` to test the `Analyzer.ResolveGroupingAnalytics` rule directly;\n3. Fix a minor bug in `ResolveGroupingAnalytics`.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nBy existing test cases, and add new testsuite `ResolveGroupingAnalyticsSuite` to test directly.\n","created_at":"2016-10-14T13:52:07Z","updated_at":"2016-11-09T02:00:35Z","closed_at":"2016-11-08T14:13:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"dfd9dd2b43b8399eec39faf8221826a33d4b8493","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15484/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15484/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15484/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ef3a733590f27e46993b93831585b083c2f83044","head":{"label":"jiangxb1987:group-set","ref":"group-set","sha":"ef3a733590f27e46993b93831585b083c2f83044","user":{"login":"jiangxb1987","id":4784782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4784782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35214686,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTIxNDY4Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"jiangxb1987/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jiangxb1987","id":4784782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4784782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nI propose a `KafkaForeachWriter.scala` in external kafka-0.8.0. \nIt's useful for someone who requires to write results to kafka in structured streaming module. It can be used with `ForeachSink`, and the usage is as below: \n\n `val query = input.writeStream`\n                   `.outputMode(\"append\")`\n                   `.foreach(new KafkaForeachWriter[Row](producerProps, topics, input.schema)`\n                   `.start()` \n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit test in `KafkaForeachWriterSuite.scala`\n","created_at":"2016-10-14T11:03:20Z","updated_at":"2016-10-25T05:46:26Z","closed_at":"2016-10-25T05:46:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2cf794a6336cb04df4244e660d67a8042347f9f5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15483/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15483/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15483/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b8e41e5861954f2ea9c0ca0f7b78023442e8110f","head":{"label":"zhangxinyu1:feature-kafkaForeachWriter-in-external-kafka-0-8-for-structured-streaming","ref":"feature-kafkaForeachWriter-in-external-kafka-0-8-for-structured-streaming","sha":"b8e41e5861954f2ea9c0ca0f7b78023442e8110f","user":{"login":"zhangxinyu1","id":12528894,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTI4ODk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12528894?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangxinyu1","html_url":"https://github.com/zhangxinyu1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangxinyu1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangxinyu1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangxinyu1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangxinyu1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangxinyu1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangxinyu1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangxinyu1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangxinyu1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangxinyu1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":68780375,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2ODc4MDM3NQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"zhangxinyu1/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zhangxinyu1","id":12528894,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTI4ODk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12528894?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangxinyu1","html_url":"https://github.com/zhangxinyu1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangxinyu1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangxinyu1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangxinyu1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangxinyu1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangxinyu1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangxinyu1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangxinyu1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangxinyu1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangxinyu1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zhangxinyu1/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis patch does a few changes to the file structure of data sources:\n- Break fileSourceInterfaces.scala into multiple pieces (HadoopFsRelation, FileFormat, OutputWriter)\n- Move ParquetOutputWriter into its own file\n\nI created this as a separate patch so it'd be easier to review my future PRs that focus on refactoring this internal logic. This patch only moves code around, and has no logic changes.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nN/A - should be covered by existing tests.\n","created_at":"2016-10-14T00:22:10Z","updated_at":"2016-10-14T06:17:12Z","closed_at":"2016-10-14T06:17:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"07199a6f3711e5d0bac2bbf07a522965a919ae03","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15473/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15473/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15473/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/be176c3f8e4d0c0c1a871872c5b3d66daee9d699","head":{"label":"rxin:SPARK-17925","ref":"SPARK-17925","sha":"be176c3f8e4d0c0c1a871872c5b3d66daee9d699","user":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17192644,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE5MjY0NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"rxin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rxin/spark","description":"Mirror

PR adds the same metrics to branch-2.0 that was added to master in #15307.** \n\nThe differences compared to the #15307 are\n- The new configuration is added only in the `SQLConf`object (i.e. `SQLConf.STREAMING_METRICS_ENABLED`) and not in the `SQLConf` class (i.e. no `SQLConf.isStreamingMetricsEnabled`). Spark master has all the streaming configurations exposed as actual fields in SQLConf class (e.g. [streamingPollingDelay](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/internal/SQLConf.scala#L642)), but [not in Spark 2.0](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/branch-2.0/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/internal/SQLConf.scala#L608). So I didnt add it in this 2.0 PR.\n- In the previous master PR, the aboveconfiguration was read in `StreamExecution` as `sparkSession.sessionState.conf.isStreamingMetricsEnabled`. In this 2.0 PR, I am instead reading it as `sparkSession.conf.get(STREAMING_METRICS_ENABLED)`(i.e. no `sessionState`) to keep it consistent with how other confs are read in `StreamExecution` (e.g. [STREAMING_POLLING_DELAY](https://github.com/tdas/spark/blob/ee8e899e4c274c363a8b4d13e8bf57b0b467a50e/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/streaming/StreamExecution.scala#L62)).\n- Different Mima exclusions\n\n---\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nMetrics are needed for monitoring structured streaming apps. Here is the design doc for implementing the necessary metrics.\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1NIdcGuR1B3WIe8t7VxLrt58TJB4DtipWEbj5I_mzJys/edit?usp=sharing\n\nSpecifically, this PR adds the following public APIs changes.\n- `StreamingQuery.status` returns a `StreamingQueryStatus` object (renamed from `StreamingQueryInfo`, see later)\n- `StreamingQueryStatus` has the following important fields\n  - inputRate - Current rate (rows/sec) at which data is being generated by all the sources\n  - processingRate - Current rate (rows/sec) at which the query is processing data from\n                                all the sources\n  - ~~outputRate~~ - _Does not work with wholestage codegen_\n  - latency - Current average latency between the data being available in source and the sink writing the corresponding output\n  - sourceStatuses: Array[SourceStatus] - Current statuses of the sources\n  - sinkStatus: SinkStatus - Current status of the sink\n  - triggerStatus - Low-level detailed status of the last completed/currently active trigger\n    - latencies - getOffset, getBatch, full trigger, wal writes\n    - timestamps - trigger start, finish, after getOffset, after getBatch\n    - numRows - input, output, state total/updated rows for aggregations\n- `SourceStatus` has the following important fields\n  - inputRate - Current rate (rows/sec) at which data is being generated by the source\n  - processingRate - Current rate (rows/sec) at which the query is processing data from the source\n  - triggerStatus - Low-level detailed status of the last completed/currently active trigger\n- Python API for `StreamingQuery.status()`\n### Breaking changes to existing APIs\n\n**Existing direct public facing APIs**\n- Deprecated direct public-facing APIs `StreamingQuery.sourceStatuses` and `StreamingQuery.sinkStatus` in favour of `StreamingQuery.status.sourceStatuses/sinkStatus`.\n  - Branch 2.0 should have it deprecated, master should have it removed.\n\n**Existing advanced listener APIs**\n- `StreamingQueryInfo` renamed to `StreamingQueryStatus` for consistency with `SourceStatus`, `SinkStatus`\n  - Earlier StreamingQueryInfo was used only in the advanced listener API, but now it is used in direct public-facing API (StreamingQuery.status)\n- Field `queryInfo` in listener events `QueryStarted`, `QueryProgress`, `QueryTerminated` changed have name `queryStatus` and return type `StreamingQueryStatus`.\n- Field `offsetDesc` in `SourceStatus` was Option[String], converted it to `String`.\n- For `SourceStatus` and `SinkStatus` made constructor private instead of private[sql] to make them more java-safe. Instead added `private[sql] object SourceStatus/SinkStatus.apply()` which are harder to accidentally use in Java.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nOld and new unit tests.\n- Rate calculation and other internal logic of StreamMetrics tested by StreamMetricsSuite.\n- New info in statuses returned through StreamingQueryListener is tested in StreamingQueryListenerSuite.\n- New and old info returned through StreamingQuery.status is tested in StreamingQuerySuite.\n- Source-specific tests for making sure input rows are counted are is source-specific test suites.\n- Additional tests to test minor additions in LocalTableScanExec, StateStore, etc.\n\nMetrics also manually tested using Ganglia sink\n","created_at":"2016-10-13T21:18:59Z","updated_at":"2016-10-18T01:33:40Z","closed_at":"2016-10-18T01:33:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2affa30e353155f45ff360a379ed2d2c373843ca","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15472/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15472/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15472/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1a32b396a3ea928ed3b6882aad50dce59ccf7c47","head":{"label":"tdas:SPARK-17731-branch-2.0","ref":"SPARK-17731-branch-2.0","sha":"1a32b396a3ea928ed3b6882aad50dce59ccf7c47","user":{"login":"tdas","id":663212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17603343,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzYwMzM0Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"tdas/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tdas","id":663212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tdas/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis patch graduates a list of Spark SQL APIs and mark them stable.\n\nThe following are marked stable:\n\nDataset/DataFrame\n- functions, since 1.3\n- ColumnName, since 1.3\n- DataFrameNaFunctions, since 1.3.1\n- DataFrameStatFunctions, since 1.4\n- UserDefinedFunction, since 1.3\n- UserDefinedAggregateFunction, since 1.5\n- Window and WindowSpec, since 1.4\n\nData sources:\n- DataSourceRegister, since 1.5\n- RelationProvider, since 1.3\n- SchemaRelationProvider, since 1.3\n- CreatableRelationProvider, since 1.3\n- BaseRelation, since 1.3\n- TableScan, since 1.3\n- PrunedScan, since 1.3\n- PrunedFilteredScan, since 1.3\n- InsertableRelation, since 1.3\n\nThe following are kept experimental / evolving:\n\nData sources:\n- CatalystScan (tied to internal logical plans so it is not stable by definition)\n\nStructured streaming:\n- all classes (introduced new in 2.0 and will likely change)\n\nDataset typed operations (introduced in 1.6 and 2.0 and might change, although probability is low)\n- all typed methods on Dataset\n- KeyValueGroupedDataset\n- o.a.s.sql.expressions.javalang.typed\n- o.a.s.sql.expressions.scalalang.typed\n- methods that return typed Dataset in SparkSession\n\nWe should discuss more whether we want to mark Dataset typed operations stable in 2.1.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nN/A - just annotation

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR prepares a new implementation `OnHeapUnsafeColumnarVector` that is optimized for reading data from a `Unsafe` related data structure (e.g. `UnsafeArrayData` or `UnsafeMapData`).\n\nCurrent implementations of `ColumnarVector` are `OnHeapColumnarVector` and `OffHeapColumnarVector`, which are optimized for reading data from Parquet. When they get an array, an map, or a struct stored in a `Unsafe` related data structure, operations in `OnHeapColumnarVector` and `OffHeapColumnarVector` lead to additional copy operations or data conversion. The `OnHeapUnsafeColumnarVector` only requires a simple memory copy and keep data in an `byte` array.\n\n`OnHeapUnsafeColumnarVector` can compress/decompress stored data by using `CompressionCodec` with `spark.sql.inMemoryColumnarStorage.compression.codec` property (default is lz4).\n\nThis PR is a part of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/15219. This is an component independent of others. For ease of review, this PR only introduces `OnHeapUnsafeColumnarVector`\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nPerform existing tests for `OnHeapUnsafeColumnVector`\n","created_at":"2016-10-13T18:12:21Z","updated_at":"2017-05-21T06:23:17Z","closed_at":"2017-05-21T06:22:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e9bea03e1d2d2d3a8de0e0e98eaff0d10c56171d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15468/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15468/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15468/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/80a502277bed9388b04ceb9c7f46649f5345632f","head":{"label":"kiszk:columnarcolumnvector","ref":"columnarcolumnvector","sha":"80a502277bed9388b04ceb9c7f46649f5345632f","user":{"login":"kiszk","id":1315079,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTUwNzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1315079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk","html_url":"https://github.com/kiszk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":45008789,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NTAwODc4OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"kiszk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kiszk","id":1315079,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTUwNzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1315079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk","html_url":"https://github.com/kiszk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kiszk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR refactors the code generation part to get data from `ColumnarVector` and `ColumnarBatch` by using a trait `ColumnarBatchScan` for ease of reuse. This is because this part will be reused by several components (e.g. parquet reader, Dataset.cache, and others) since `ColumnarBatch` will be first citizen.\n\nThis PR is a part of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/15219. In advance, this PR makes the code generation for  `ColumnarVector` and `ColumnarBatch` reuseable as a trait. In general, this is very useful for other components from the reuseability view, too.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\ntested existing test suites\n","created_at":"2016-10-13T16:21:56Z","updated_at":"2017-01-19T23:18:00Z","closed_at":"2017-01-19T23:18:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2efcc0092cec8c9c2fec95e7c54d13fb1975ea1b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15467/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15467/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15467/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9a53219e569dd1cbd05f3c0a1920840d53736c12","head":{"label":"kiszk:columnarrefactor","ref":"columnarrefactor","sha":"9a53219e569dd1cbd05f3c0a1920840d53736c12","user":{"login":"kiszk","id":1315079,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTUwNzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1315079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk","html_url":"https://github.com/kiszk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":45008789,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NTAwODc4OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"kiszk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kiszk","id":1315079,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTUwNzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1315079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk","html_url":"https://github.com/kiszk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiszk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kiszk/spark","description":"Mirror

way](https://github.com/pwendell/hive/blob/release-1.2.1-spark/ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/parse/VariableSubstitution.java#L38) after [SPARK-10810](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-10810). but based on one SQLContext per session,  we can set variables to SQLContext. this is similar to [SPARK-15730](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-15730)\n Thus, this PR is to set `--hivevar` and `--hiveconf` variables to `SQLContext` and then `VariableSubstitution` can substitution these

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\n`TaskSetManager` should have unique name to avoid adding duplicate ones to parent `Pool` via `SchedulableBuilder`. This problem has been surfaced with following discussion: [[PR: Avoid adding duplicate schedulables]](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/15326)\n\n**Proposal** :\nThere is 1x1 relationship between `stageAttemptId` and `TaskSetManager` so `taskSet.Id` covering both `stageId` and `stageAttemptId` looks to be used for uniqueness of `TaskSetManager` name instead of just `stageId`.\n\n**Current

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis pull request adds test cases for the following cases:\n- keep all data types with null or without null\n- access `CachedBatch` disabling whole

Here are motivations to add these tests. When https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/15219 is enabled, the first two cases are handled by specialized (generated) code. The third one is a pitfall.\n\nIn general, even for now, it would be helpful to increase test coverage.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nadded test suites

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nPrior to this patch, we'll generate `compare(...)` for `GeneratedClass$SpecificOrdering` like below, leading to Janino exceptions saying the code grows beyond 64 KB.\n\n``` scala\n/* 005 */ class SpecificOrdering extends org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.codegen.BaseOrdering {\n/* ..... */   ...\n/* 10969 */   private int compare(InternalRow a, InternalRow b) {\n/* 10970 */     InternalRow i = null;  // Holds current row being evaluated.\n/* 10971 */\n/* 1.... */     code for comparing field0\n/* 1.... */     code for comparing field1\n/* 1.... */     ...\n/* 1.... */     code for comparing field449\n/* 15012 */\n/* 15013 */     return 0;\n/* 15014 */   }\n/* 15015 */ }\n```\n\nThis patch would break `compare(...)` into smaller `compare_xxx(...)` methods when necessary; then we'll get generated `compare(...)` like:\n\n``` scala\n/* 001 */ public SpecificOrdering generate(Object[] references) {\n/* 002 */

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently `HiveExternalCatalog` will filter out the Spark SQL internal table properties, e.g. `spark.sql.sources.provider`, `spark.sql.sources.schema`, etc. This is reasonable for external users as they don't want to see these internal properties in `DESC TABLE`.\n\nHowever, as a Spark developer, sometimes we do wanna see the raw table properties. This PR adds a new internal SQL conf, `spark.sql.debug`, to enable debug mode and keep these raw table properties.\n\nThis config can also be used in similar places where we wanna retain debug information in the future.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nnew test in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIn our universal gateway service we need to specify different jars to Spark according to scala version. For now only after launching Spark application can we know which version of Scala it depends on. It makes hard for us to support different Scala + Spark versions to pick the right jars.\n\nSo here propose to print out Scala version according to Spark version in \"spark-submit --version\", so that user could leverage this output to make the choice without needing to launching application.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nManually verified in local environment.\n","created_at":"2016-10-13T02:18:19Z","updated_at":"2016-10-13T08:41:05Z","closed_at":"2016-10-13T07:26:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"504eae8e6e96405b1d69784dac8fe9a0803c2a71","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15456/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15456/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15456/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3c2b729f27b1ab01cc8bc5d837d133618b5b29c4","head":{"label":"jerryshao:SPARK-17686","ref":"SPARK-17686","sha":"3c2b729f27b1ab01cc8bc5d837d133618b5b29c4","user":{"login":"jerryshao","id":850797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDc5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/850797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao","html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18259371,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODI1OTM3MQ==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"jerryshao/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jerryshao","id":850797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDc5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/850797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao","html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nFix a bug where spill metrics were being reported as shuffle metrics. Eventually these spill metrics should be reported (SPARK-3577), but separate from shuffle metrics.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently users can kill stages via the web ui but not jobs directly (jobs are killed if one of their stages is). I've added the ability to kill jobs via the web ui. This code change is based on #4823 by @lianhuiwang and updated to work with the latest code matching how stages are currently killed. In general I've copied the kill stage code warning and note comments and all. I also updated applicable tests and documentation.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nManually tested and dev/run-tests\n\n![screen shot 2016-10-11 at 4 49 43

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis patch improves the window function frame boundary API to make it more obvious to read and to use. The two high level changes are:\n1. Create Window.currentRow, Window.unboundedPreceding, Window.unboundedFollowing to indicate the special values in frame boundaries. These methods map to the special integral values so we are not breaking backward compatibility here. This change makes the frame boundaries more self-evident (instead of Long.MinValue, it becomes Window.unboundedPreceding).\n2. In Python, for any value less than or equal to JVM's Long.MinValue, treat it as Window.unboundedPreceding. For any value larger than or equal to JVM's Long.MaxValue, treat it as Window.unboundedFollowing. Before this change, if the user specifies any value that is less than Long.MinValue but not -sys.maxsize (e.g. -sys.maxsize + 1), the number we pass over to the JVM would overflow, resulting in a frame that does not make sense.\n\nCode example required to specify a frame before this patch:\n\n```\nWindow.rowsBetween(-Long.MinValue, 0)\n```\n\nWhile the above code should still work, the new way is more obvious to read:\n\n```\nWindow.rowsBetween(Window.unboundedPreceding, Window.currentRow)\n```\n## How was this patch tested?\n- Updated DataFrameWindowSuite (for Scala/Java)\n- Updated test_window_functions_cumulative_sum (for Python)\n- Renamed DataFrameWindowSuite DataFrameWindowFunctionsSuite to better reflect its purpose\n","created_at":"2016-10-11T20:32:10Z","updated_at":"2016-10-12T23:47:52Z","closed_at":"2016-10-12T23:47:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"92097b7ed5dd8cc4a1a9c70c804e99c5adf418fe","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15438/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15438/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15438/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1913d29b36a408e8b583fc97045847369e31ff66","head":{"label":"rxin:SPARK-17845","ref":"SPARK-17845","sha":"1913d29b36a408e8b583fc97045847369e31ff66","user":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17192644,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE5MjY0NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"rxin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rxin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nUnlike Hive, in Spark SQL, ALTER TABLE RENAME TO cannot move a table from one database to another(e.g. `ALTER TABLE db1.tbl RENAME TO db2.tbl2`), and will report error if the database in source table and destination table is different. So in #14955 , we forbid users to specify database of destination table in ALTER TABLE RENAME TO, to be consistent with other database systems and also make it easier to rename tables in non-current database, e.g. users can write `ALTER TABLE db1.tbl RENAME TO tbl2`, instead of `ALTER TABLE db1.tbl RENAME TO db1.tbl2`.\n\nHowever, this is a breaking change. Users may already have queries that specify database of destination table in ALTER TABLE RENAME TO.\n\nThis PR reverts most of #14955 , and simplify the usage of ALTER TABLE RENAME TO by making database of source table the default database of destination table, instead of current database, so that users can still write `ALTER TABLE db1.tbl RENAME TO tbl2`, which is consistent with other databases like MySQL, Postgres, etc.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nThe added back tests and some new tests.\n","created_at":"2016-10-11T14:44:32Z","updated_at":"2016-10-19T03:25:22Z","closed_at":"2016-10-19T03:25:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"841fe729971829fc9e8f26fb7ca86ff913cd154f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15434/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15434/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15434/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/65c1885818e4b712c2132e7e97e0b96ceb3f6dd7","head":{"label":"cloud-fan:revert","ref":"revert","sha":"65c1885818e4b712c2132e7e97e0b96ceb3f6dd7","user":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19689699,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTY4OTY5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"cloud-fan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR proposes `rand`/`randn` accept `null` as input in Scala/SQL and `LongType` as input in SQL. In this case, it treats the values as `0`.\n\nSo, this PR includes both changes below:\n- `null` support\n  \n  It seems MySQL also accepts this.\n  \n  ``` sql\n  mysql> select rand(0);\n  +---------------------+\n  | rand(0)             |\n  +---------------------+\n  | 0.15522042769493574 |\n  +---------------------+\n  1 row in set (0.00 sec)\n  \n  mysql> select rand(NULL);\n

according to [HIVE-14694](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-14694)\n  \n  So the codes below:\n  \n  ``` scala\n  spark.range(1).selectExpr(\"rand(null)\").show()\n  ```\n  \n  prints..\n  \n  **Before**\n  \n  ```\n    Input argument to rand must be an integer literal.;; line 1 pos 0\n  org.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: Input argument to rand must be an integer literal.;; line 1 pos

  +-----------------------+\n    |    0.13385709732307427|\n    +-----------------------+\n  ```\n- `LongType` support in SQL.\n  \n  In addition, it make the function allows to take `LongType` consistently within Scala/SQL.\n  \n  In more details, the codes below:\n  \n  ``` scala\n  spark.range(1).select(rand(1), rand(1L)).show()\n  spark.range(1).selectExpr(\"rand(1)\", \"rand(1L)\").show()\n  ```\n  \n  prints..\n  \n  **Before**\n  \n  ```\n  +------------------+------------------+\n  |           rand(1)|           rand(1)|\n

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR is an enhancement of PR with commit ID:57dc326bd00cf0a49da971e9c573c48ae28acaa2.\nNaN is a special type of value which is commonly seen as invalid. But We find that there are certain cases where NaN are also valuable, thus need special handling. We provided user when dealing NaN values with 3 options, to either reserve an extra bucket for NaN values, or remove the NaN values, or report an error, by setting handleNaN \"keep\", \"skip\", or \"error\"(default) respectively.\n\n'''Before:\nval bucketizer: Bucketizer = new Bucketizer()\n          .setInputCol(\"feature\")\n          .setOutputCol(\"result\")\n

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nTwo issues regarding Dataset.dropduplicates:\n1. Dataset.dropDuplicates should consider the columns with same column name\n   \n   We find and get the first resolved attribute from output with the given column name in `Dataset.dropDuplicates`. When we have the more than one columns with the same name. Other columns are put into aggregation columns, instead of grouping columns.\n2. Dataset.dropDuplicates should not change the output of child plan\n   \n   We create new `Alias` with new exprId in `Dataset.dropDuplicates` now. However it causes problem when we want to select the columns as follows:\n   \n   ```\n   val ds = Seq((\"a\", 1), (\"a\", 2), (\"b\", 1), (\"a\", 1)).toDS()\n   // ds(\"_2\") will cause analysis exception\n   ds.dropDuplicates(\"_1\").select(ds(\"_1\").as[String], ds(\"_2\").as[Int])\n   ```\n\nBecause the two issues are both related to `Dataset.dropduplicates` and the code changes are not big, so submitting them together as one PR.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nJenkins
