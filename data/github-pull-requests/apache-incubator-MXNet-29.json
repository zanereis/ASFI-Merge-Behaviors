Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented:  \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n\r\n - Currently the new function is called when there is no requirement for backward pass, but it is easily extendable to include

Description ##\r\nThis PR fixed several things.\r\n\r\n1. Legacy `NDArray` `__setitem__` now works in the following case. @astonzhang \r\n```python\r\n>>> import mxnet as mx\r\n>>> a = mx.nd.ones((2, 3))\r\n>>> b = mx.nd.zeros((1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3))\r\n>>> a[0] = b\r\n>>> a\r\n\r\n[[0. 0. 0.]\r\n [1. 1. 1.]]\r\n<NDArray 2x3 @cpu(0)>\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. `np.true_divide` supports integral dtypes and outputs float32. @haojin2 \r\n\r\n3. Loading legacy symbol json files in `np_shape` semantics. @stu1130 @frankfliu \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed

created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge,

(i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\nMXNet depends on thread local store from dmlc-core. There are two versions of Thread Local store implementations. One where the thread local object gets destructed when the spawned thread finishes and the other where thread local object is alive for the lifetime of the program. MXNet C API code is based on this assumption that the thread local object extends beyond the lifetime of the thread in which the API is called (assuming that it is called from a different thread). Example : https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/src/c_api/c_api_ndarray.cc#L251\r\n\r\nThus using the old implementation.\r\nRequired PR : https://github.com/dmlc/dmlc-core/pull/573\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with

finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

(i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n@PatricZhao @TaoLv @xinyu-intel @ciyongch

Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by

complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nKnown common issues:\r\n- data type coverage\r\n- some module (like masked array, np.matrix, etc) not supported\r\n- python native scalar and list objects are not dispatchable\r\n\r\n@reminisce Thanks for your effort to review the test codes, please feedback me any

Description ##\r\n\r\nRight now the following example (similar as from https://github.com/dmlc/gluon-cv/issues/750) yields surprising and unexpected output:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport mxnet as mx \r\nlr_scheduler = mx.lr_scheduler.FactorScheduler(1000, base_lr=10) \r\noptim = mx.optimizer.create('sgd', lr_scheduler=lr_scheduler)\r\n\r\nprint(optim.learning_rate) # 0.01\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the current implementation of optimizer, mxnet overwrite the learning rate scheduler's learning rate with the optimizer's learning rate by \r\n\r\n```python\r\nif lr_scheduler is not None:\t\r\n    self.lr_scheduler.base_lr = learning_rate\r\n```\r\n\r\nTherefore, when users define a learning rate scheduler, and use it as the parameter of the optimizer, they are going to surprisingly find that the learning rate has been overwritten by the default value, `0.01`.\r\n\r\nMy patch set default `learning_rate` to `None`, and assign the original `0.01` to it only in the absence of `lr_scheduler`.

PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-14T08:00:28Z","updated_at":"2019-10-16T06:00:04Z","closed_at":"2019-10-16T06:00:04Z","merged_at":"2019-10-16T06:00:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"c2bbde75c36be2fef4a5e6d941cc01f5aabd9fd2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1232775555,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjMyNzc1NTU1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Numpy","name":"Numpy","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/16469/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/16469/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/16469/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/733936915c437f8ed226809439fb7f86aeaeb433","head":{"label":"vexilligera:master","ref":"master","sha":"733936915c437f8ed226809439fb7f86aeaeb433","user":{"login":"vexilligera","id":20215432,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMjE1NDMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20215432?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vexilligera","html_url":"https://github.com/vexilligera","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vexilligera/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vexilligera/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vexilligera/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vexilligera/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vexilligera/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vexilligera/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vexilligera/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vexilligera/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vexilligera/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"6d6e46b7f4f4b018d1d0bfb82ed5ca83dbb9dfcc","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34864402,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDg2NDQwMg==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"apache/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admi

Description ##\r\nWhen `.hybridize()` is not called, the forward function of HybridBlock supports a broader range of inputs. For example, the combination of `ndarray` and scalar values. The following code will run smoothly without error:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom mxnet import gluon\r\nclass FooHybrid(gluon.HybridBlock):\r\n    def hybrid_forward(self, F, a, b):\r\n        if isinstance(a, (list, tuple)):\r\n            a = sum(a)\r\n        if isinstance(b, (list, tuple)):\r\n            b = sum(b)\r\n        return a + b\r\nfoo_hybrid = FooHybrid()\r\na = foo_hybrid(mx.nd.ones((10,)), 1)\r\nb = foo_hybrid(mx.nd.ones((10,)), mx.nd.ones((10,)))\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, when hybridized, the second line will trigger an error:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom mxnet import gluon\r\nclass FooHybrid(gluon.HybridBlock):\r\n    def hybrid_forward(self, F, a, b):\r\n        if isinstance(a, (list, tuple)):\r\n            a = sum(a)\r\n        if isinstance(b, (list, tuple)):\r\n            b = sum(b)\r\n        return a + b\r\nfoo_hybrid = FooHybrid()\r\nfoo_hybrid.hybridize()\r\na = foo_hybrid(mx.nd.ones((10,)), 1)\r\n# line below triggers the error\r\nb = foo_hybrid(mx.nd.ones((10,)), mx.nd.ones((10,)))\r\n```\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/16280 tries to make sure that in both cases, HybridBlock will raise an error. However, it will make the code backward-incompatible. This PR fixes this backward-incompatible problem and adds new tests for such behavior.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [

Description ##\r\nAs reported in https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/16401, the pylint check performed by the 'sanity' CI runner has been flakey.  Toward correcting this, the planned steps of this PR are:\r\n\r\n1. demo that the pylint failure can be made solid if the pylint parallelism is reduced from the current 8 jobs to 1 job.\r\n2. fix the source code issues exposed\r\n3. merge the PR, leaving the pylint parallelism at jobs==1 (at a runtime expense of about 1 minute, a small price to pay for complete and reliable error reporting)\r\n\r\nIf others want to jump in to diagnose the pylint issues, the CI command is:\r\n```\r\npython3 -m pylint --rcfile=./ci/other/pylintrc --ignore-patterns=\".*\\.so$,.*\\.dll$,.*\\.dylib$\" python/mxnet tools/caffe_converter/*.py\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by

Description ##\r\nThis PR fixes nightly tests for binaries, that have been failing since 09/19.\r\n\r\nOne of the errors is because requirements file was not copied to the teat environment.\r\nThe other errors are due to numpy warnings treated as errors.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-11T23:39:08Z","updated_at":"2020-06-01T10:47:32Z","closed_at":"2019-10-14T19:35:39Z","merged_at":"2019-10-14T19:35:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"12569767896d38fca24ccb8b7164c9cfa2b64fbc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"aaronmarkham","id":5974205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzQyMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5974205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham","html_url":"https://github.com/aaronmarkham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/16451/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/16451/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/16451/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/f38bee49d53ae3627f7e8cb7238ffb0163ad7db0","head":{"label":"mseth10:debug_nightly","ref":"debug_nightly","sha":"f38bee49d53ae3627f7e8cb7238ffb0163ad7db0","user":{"login":"mseth10","id":22492939,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDkyOTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22492939?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseth10","html_url":"https://github.com/mseth10","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseth10/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseth10/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseth10/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseth10/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseth10/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseth10/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseth10/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseth10/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseth10/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":142907804,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDI5MDc4MDQ=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"mseth10/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mseth10","id":22492939,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDkyOTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22492939?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseth10","html_url":"https://github.com/mseth10","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseth10/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseth10/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseth10/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseth10/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseth10/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseth10/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseth10/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseth10/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mseth10/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mseth10/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nCurrently, `USE_TVM_OP` defaults to`ON` on Unix machines in the CI. When one operator is implemented w/ and w/o TVM, the non-TVM implementation is not tested in the CI on Unix machines. This PR adds additional test pipeline for those implementations on Unix.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-11T23:08:37Z","updated_at":"2019-10-19T15:19:37Z","closed_at":"2019-10-19T15:19:37Z","merged_at":"2019-10-19T15:19:37Z","merge_commit_sha":"9fecfbb8c3f15255bec0e832336a6ea921af91ff","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"aaronmarkham","id":5974205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzQyMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5974205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham","html_url":"https://github.com/aaronmarkham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/16450/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/16450/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/16450/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/9d61d86eca7f43834458d94c9c712e0835d18033","head":{"label":"reminisce:add_non_tvm_op_pipeline","ref":"add_non_tvm_op_pipeline","sha":"9d61d86eca7f43834458d94c9c712e0835d18033","user":{"login":"reminisce","id":4978794,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Nzg3OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4978794?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce","html_url":"https://github.com/reminisce","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":79397572,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3OTM5NzU3Mg==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"reminisce/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"reminisce","id":4978794,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Nzg3OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4978794?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce","html_url":"https://github.com/remi

Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if

Description ##\r\nFix https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/16399\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [X] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [X] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [X] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [X] Fix crash when attempting to load a NDArray that was saved with GPU context on a MXNet runtime built with Cuda but when no GPUs are present\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- I'm not sure if the CI actually tests the case of \"GPU build of MXNET but no GPU present\". So the test added here may always pass on

Description ##\r\nthis PR is aimed to address the issue: https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/16394\r\n\r\nthe root cause is the pytest not up-to-date. The possible fix are either go with older version of attrs library or upgrade pytest. \r\n\r\n@TaoLv @PatricZhao @marcoabreu \r\n\r\nThis should fix the onnx test failure.\r\n\r\n## Checklist

coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

Description ##\r\nThe code for the gradient of the activation of type \"softrelu\" is wrong. This most likely lead to the flaky tests referenced in #13915 which failed exactly in the gradient checking. Unfortunately these tests where then simply disabled by PR 14969 instead of root causing it. This fix adds correct gradient computation and re-enables the tests.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [X ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [X ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [X ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ X] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-10T12:41:48Z","updated_at":"2019-10-10T13:44:28Z","closed_at":"2019-10-10T13:44:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"54e0aa2a69d9dfab087e03e8214232dbb03302db","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/16428/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/16428/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/16428/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/afd85c6f0e5812f09557a19a2dd2f638281e5733","head":{"label":"asmushetzel:softrelu_fix","ref":"softrelu_fix","sha":"afd85c6f0e5812f09557a19a2dd2f638281e5733","user":{"login":"asmushetzel","id":25875939,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1ODc1OTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25875939?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmushetzel","html_url":"https://github.com/asmushetzel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmushetzel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmushetzel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmushetzel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmushetzel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmushetzel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmushetzel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmushetzel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmushetzel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmushetzel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":85088258,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4NTA4ODI1OA==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"asmushetzel/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"asmushetzel","id":25875939,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1ODc1OTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25875939?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmushetzel","html_url":"https://github.com/asmushetzel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmushetzel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmushetzel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmushetzel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmushetzel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmushetzel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmushetzel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmushetzel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmushetzel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asmushetzel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/asmushetzel/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

[ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

Description ##\r\nAdd wrapper for unary and binary ufuncs to provide better error handling when given unsupported arguments and raise proper messages to users.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Decorator for unary and binary ufuncs.\r\n- [x] Refactor of binary funcs' unit tests\r\n- [x] Additional error handling tests for both unary and binary ufuncs\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nFlakiness checked locally:\r\n```\r\nMXNET_TEST_COUNT=10000 nosetests -s -v

Description ##\r\nThis PR implemented comparison operators introduced in https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/15940 to complement the implementation without relying on TVM. This implementation will be included in 1.6 release.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

Description ##\r\n⭐️  This PR adds a pipeline that will deploy the Jekyll and Python docs to the [staging beta website](https://mxnet-beta.staged.apache.org/).\r\n💥 `Jenkinsfile_website` was not being used since the new site deploy, so I removed it. PRs have been using `Jenksinfile_website_full_pr`.\r\n\r\nI setup a new Jenkins job for the build that can be manually triggered with [restricted-website-build-master-beta](http://jenkins.mxnet-ci.amazon-ml.com/job/restricted-website-build-master-beta/).\r\nThe pipeline will then trigger a publish on [restricted-website-publish-master-beta](http://jenkins.mxnet-ci.amazon-ml.com/job/restricted-website-publish-master-beta/).\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\nIf you want to use the beta pipeline once this is merged, you can change the [restricted-website-build-master-beta](http://jenkins.mxnet-ci.amazon-ml.com/job/restricted-website-build-master-beta/) job to point to your fork and PR branch, build it, and once it is done preview your stuff at https://mxnet-beta.staged.apache.org/\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\nI chose to only build Python and Jekyll to save some time in each test deploy. I think that in the future it would be nice to have parameters on the job, so you can select which API docs you want to include in the test deployment.","created_at":"2019-10-09T18:59:17Z","updated_at":"2019-10-10T23:33:35Z","closed_at":"2019-10-10T23:33:35Z","merged_at":"2019-10-10T23:33:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"e484f721d338e6944f5cfefeb24ce9943ae6aa6f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"marcoabreu","id":18629099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI5MDk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18629099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu","html_url":"https://github.com/marcoabreu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":708199304,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MDgxOTkzMDQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Website","name":"Website","color":"5319e7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":823354603,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjMzNTQ2MDM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/CI","name":"CI","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/16411/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/16411/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/16411/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/57185b3e6f50649e37bb36fe90baa4a9a5fc3f6a","head":{"label":"aaronmarkham:beta_build","ref":"beta_build","sha":"57185b3e6f50649e37bb36fe90baa4a9a5fc3f6a","user":{"login":"aaronmarkham","id":5974205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzQyMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5974205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham","html_url":"https://github.com/aaronmarkham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":105819747,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDU4MTk3NDc=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"aaronmarkham/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"aaronmarkham","id":5974205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzQyMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5974205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham","html_url":"https://github.com/aaronmarkham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham

Description ##\r\nAdd new optimized Ops for Multihead attention\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [X] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- [X] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- [X] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- Add 4 Ops: (matmul(K,Q) and matmul(attention_weights, V). For both self-attention and encoder-decoder\r\n- Add unit test for those Ops\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- https://github.com/Caenorst/gluon-nlp/tree/fast_mha shows a example of integration in BERT, it will not be PRed to gluon-nlp as it's breaking it (out of BERT usage).\r\n- Those Ops require to have a different layout (sequence, batch, encoding) except for the masked softmax / dropout\r\n- Those Ops change the ordering of projection weights, which means a pretrained BERT without those Ops need to have the weights processed as in: https://github.com/Caenorst/incubator-mxnet/commit/e98761456ba0343664ba550e056f00db31516ac7#diff-4758fb9329d438de2836db2634a8f5f7R2505-R2519 in order to use those Ops.\r\n- The argument `bwd_ignore_zero_init` allow to further speedup and reduce the memory consumption but is only giving good results with `MXNET_EXEC_ENABLE_ADDTO` set to 1, it's also a dirty trick as it's actually not \"adding to\" but initializing (it rely on the fact that the two ops inputs are actually complete (not overlapping and using the whole tensor), despite using the same tensor.","created_at":"2019-10-09T16:59:39Z","updated_at":"2020-02-14T18:46:48Z","closed_at":"2019-11-07T02:00:44Z","merged_at":"2019-11-07T02:00:44Z","merge_commit_sha":"da33da3cb8774b92892ed675531b43d2d5d2e967","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/16408/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/16408/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/16408/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/dbcb5b511619416da53e0b89d539bcd2c470b703","head":{"label":"Caenorst:fast_mha","ref":"fast_mha","sha":"dbcb5b511619416da53e0b89d539bcd2c470b703","user":{"login":"Caenorst","id":10882588,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODgyNTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10882588?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Caenorst","html_url":"https://github.com/Caenorst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Caenorst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Caenorst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Caenorst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Caenorst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Caenorst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Caenorst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Caenorst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Caenorst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Caenorst/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":141742082,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDE3NDIwODI=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"Caenorst/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Caenorst","id":10882588,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODgyNTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10882588?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Caenorst","html_url":"https://github.com/Caenorst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Caenorst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Caenorst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Caenorst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Caenorst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Caenorst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Caenorst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Caenorst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Caenorst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Caenorst/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Caenorst/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nMxNet operator for aggregated Adam update\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] New operator allows to make Adam update for multiple gradients in one kernel.\r\ntests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [x] Test, for previously used \"single\" Adam update modified and now it also includes the use of `clip_gradient` parameter and random variations for `lr`, `eta`, `wd` and

this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If

Description ##\r\nBackground: A non-deterministic failure of test_operator_gpu.py:test_lstm_bidirectional that was observed just once in our own CI was found to be due to cuDNN's RNN dgrad implementation.  cuDNN launches many kernels as part of the RNN dgrad into various auxiliary streams that are different than the primary user-settable stream of the cuDNN handle.  A final kernel launched by cuDNN into one of these aux streams was not being synchronized (via events) back to the handle's stream.  When MXNet's RNN::Backward() returns, a gradient summation kernel can be launched by the GPU worker into its main stream and this kernel's execution could potentially overlap or even precede that of the final cuDNN RNN dgrad kernel.  MXNet's calling of cuDNN's wgrad immediately after dgrad makes this data-race failure exceedingly rare, and in fact we discovered the problem by code inspection, not by being able to reproduce the original CI failure.\r\n\r\nThe first commit of this PR will demonstrate the failure.  The approach is to have MXNet now skip the RNN wgrad operation if grad_req = {'data':'add', 'parameters':'none'}, plus expand the test_lstm_bidirectional test to invoke this case.  Skipping wgrad aggravates the data race by allowing MXNet to launch the gradient summation kernel sooner after the RNN dgrad kernels are launched with no intervening wgrad gpu activity.\r\n\r\nOnce the failure is solidly demonstrated, a follow-up commit will supply the fix.  The fix will use cuda events directed at the legacy default stream to ensure all dgrad GPU activity is complete before the wgrad or other kernels begin.  Unlike a cudaDeviceSynchronize(), the fix will not block the CPU.  nvprof-based timing analysis of the fix shows no measurable difference in timing for the single-RNN case analyzed.\r\n\r\nThe fix is needed for all versions of cuDNN supported by MXNet (so up to the current v7.6.4) and is needed only for non-persistent bidirectional RNNs.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel

well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If

items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not
