#8219 we noticed that we couldn't set a `default=0` because of the\n`and v` check. The \"add_argument\" function in python avoid this by using\n**kwargs, but we want type checking so can't directly use the same\nthere.\n\nThis uses the same pattern that configparser does to allow falsey (0,\nFalse) and even `None` as valid values, distinct from not being passed.\n\n\n---\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before creating PR: [x]\n\n- [x] Description above provides context of

https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/8388\r\nSummary: \r\nIf a dag has not been turned on and/or never been run (i.e. no dagruns associated with this DAG) and you click on that DAG in the admin page, click on a task in the DAG graph, and then click on `Task Instance Details` you get the \"Ooops\" explosion error page.  The reason is `DagrunIdDep` expects a dagrun to exist.  This PR adds a check to make sure a dagrun exists.\r\n\r\n---\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before creating PR: [x]\r\n\r\n- [x] Description above provides context of the change\r\n- [x] Unit

\r\n\r\nUsers often have problems with the runtime environment or with several basic configuration options. To make it easier to gather information, I have created an additional command that allows us to collect the necessary data also in anonymized form.\r\n\r\nFor now, I've added only a few basic keys, but I think we can easily extend based on observation. In particular, I'd like to see keys that get some data from the database (e.g. jobs). However, this can be done in the future.\r\n\r\nI would like to cherry-pick this command to Airflow 1.10, so I didn't use the latest syntax from Python 3.\r\n\r\nBest

Removes code:\r\n\r\n```python \r\nperiod_end = dag.following_schedule(next_run_date)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI can't find any reason for variable `period_end`. As I said in comment: \r\nthis variable always has value `next_run_date + interval` and sometimes it's greater than `timezone.utcnow()`.\r\n\r\n2. Removes code:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif dag.schedule_interval == '@once':\r\n\tperiod_end = next_run_date\r\n...\r\nif next_run_date and period_end and period_end <= timezone.utcnow():\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause it may be modified to:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nif dag.schedule_interval == '@once' and next_run_date \\\r\n   and next_run_date >= timezone.utcnow():\r\n    return\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut this lines will not execute, because previous statement:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nif not next_run_date or next_run_date > timezone.utcnow():\r\n                return\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo if I remove this lines never changes.\r\n\r\nPlease, review this PR. May be you can find a reason for existence `period_end`\r\n","created_at":"2020-04-13T19:32:43Z","updated_at":"2020-11-17T12:51:54Z","closed_at":"2020-11-17T12:51:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d4c8e9861f78a6c79aabefb157e902bd0b3df5eb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545560198,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTYwMTk4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:Scheduler","name":"area:Scheduler","color":"6a3aaa","default":false,"description":"including

DAG code only seemed to update in certain conditions. After closer inspection, it turns out we save utcnow() in the last_updated column. With a threshold of 120 seconds, the result was that a file updated within two minutes from the last utcnow(), will never be updated.\r\n\r\nThis change simply checks if the last updated time is larger than the last updated time registered in the DB. If so, that means a change and the file is updated.\r\n\r\nDraft for now, because I don't understand the reasoning for a 120 second threshold yet, plus want to check tests. @kaxil why was the 120 second threshold in there? Simply checking for a different modification time makes more sense to me, with this change I instantly see the updated code in the webserver, and I don't think people update DAG code every second.\r\n\r\nLastly, I noticed the other views seem to suffer from a similar bug when using `AIRFLOW__CORE__STORE_SERIALIZED_DAGS=True`. Clicking Refresh in the UI doesn't update the DAG structure if I add a new task. Will cover in a separate issue.\r\n\r\n---\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before creating PR: [x]\r\n\r\n- [x] Description above provides context of the change\r\n- [x] Unit tests coverage for

vendored and has not been updated since 2016: https://github.com/apache/airflow/commits/v1-10-test/airflow/www/static/d3.v3.min.js , but in RBAC a newer version of d3 is installed via package.json. Perhaps the interpretation of `axisLabelDistance` has changed in the newer versions of d3?\r\n\r\nI have tested this patch on Airflow 1.10.10. Didn't test on master yet, but I'm going to if I manage to get along with the breeze environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before creating PR: [x]\r\n\r\n- [x] Description
