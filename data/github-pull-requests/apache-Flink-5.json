you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follow [the conventions for tests defined in our code quality guide](https://flink.apache.org/how-to-contribute/code-style-and-quality-common/#7-testing).\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2024-12-03T08:06:04Z","updated_at":"2024-12-04T14:29:24Z","closed_at":"2024-12-04T14:29:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25726/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25726/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/25726/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/3263c8988b89c8f92a19cc4a5d08701188a333ea","head":{"label":"codenohup:generialized-watermark","ref":"generialized-watermark","sha":"3263c8988b89c8f92a19cc4a5d08701188a333ea","user":{"login":"codenohup","id":130116763,"node_id":"U_kgDOB8Fsmw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/130116763?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenohup","html_url":"https://github.com/codenohup","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenohup/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenohup/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenohup/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenohup/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenohup/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenohup/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenohup/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenohup/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenohup/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":638940839,"node_id":"R_kgDOJhV2pw","name":"flink","full_name":"codenohup/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"codenohup","id":130116763,"node_id":"U_kgDOB8Fsmw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/130116763?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenohup","html_url":"https://github.com/codenohup","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenohup/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenohup/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenohup/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenohup/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenohup/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenohup/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenohup/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenohup/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codenohup/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/codenohup/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix memory lease in flink-s3-fs-hadoop\r\n\r\nFrom https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-13028\r\n\r\nintroduce org.apache.hadoop.fs.s3a.S3AInstrumentation, it will be created every time org.apache.hadoop.fs.s3a.S3AFileSystem#initialize \r\n\r\nand be registerd to static field meticsystem by org.apache.hadoop.fs.s3a.S3AInstrumentation#registerAsMetricsSource，but no one call \r\nmetricsSystem.unregisterSource(metricsSourceName); during runtime, it will cause memory lease when use filesystem plugin to write s3 storage\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\nIt is hard to downgrade hadoop version to 2.8 prior\r\nSo the simple way is to\r\noverwrite S3AInstrumentation of hadoop-aws not to register anymore\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): on\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`:  no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): yes\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no \r\n  - The S3 file system connector: yes\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Add a SqlDriver to load the ScriptRunner to execute the script. It supports to read file from remote filesystem or http(s) service.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Introduce the driver to load the specified runner and script in the external system.*\r\n  - *Introduce a runner to load the required environment to run the tests.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follow [the conventions for tests defined in our code quality guide](https://flink.apache.org/how-to-contribute/code-style-and-quality-common/#7-testing).\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - *Added integration tests to run script in the filesystem or http server.*\r\n  - *Added integration tests to run script .*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (**not applicable** / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2024-12-03T05:47:43Z","updated_at":"2025-01-02T12:25:09Z","closed_at":"2025-01-02T12:25:09Z","merged_at":"2025-01-02T12:25:09Z","merge_commit_sha":"b700f1c2dec22e10b029e985ed483544618ceaf5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272993074,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTkzMDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=%3Cnone%3E","name":"component=<none>","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25724/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25724/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/25724/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/0141594e0e78638b0cb6ed392736f7e0a12eba7b","head":{"label":"fsk119:driver","ref":"driver","sha":"0141594e0e78638b0cb6ed392736f7e0a12eba7b","user":{"login":"fsk119","id":33114724,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMTE0NzI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33114724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119","html_url":"https://github.com/fsk119","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":270591305,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzA1OTEzMDU=","name":"flink","full_name":"fsk119/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fsk119","id":33114724,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMTE0NzI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33114724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119","html_url":"https://github.com/fsk119","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fsk119/flink","description":"Apache

To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number.

extra \"are\" word\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC.

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\nRelated-to: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-36689\r\nAngular framework and NG-ZORRO both have released their stable v18 versions. It is a good time to bump them to the latest.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Angular: v18.2.13\r\n- ng-zorro-antd: v18.2.1\r\n- typescript: v5.4.5\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follow [the conventions for tests defined in our code quality guide](https://flink.apache.org/how-to-contribute/code-style-and-quality-common/#7-testing).\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): yes\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n Upgrade Apache ORC Version to 1.9.4.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Upgrade Apache ORC Version to 1.9.4.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follow [the conventions for tests defined in our code quality guide](https://flink.apache.org/how-to-contribute/code-style-and-quality-common/#7-testing).\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as:\r\n- *Tested the reading and writing of ORC files in the flink-orc and flink-orc-nohive modules.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no )\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2024-11-30T03:20:05Z","updated_at":"2025-01-20T12:29:02Z","closed_at":"2025-01-20T12:29:02Z","merged_at":"2025-01-20T12:29:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"363a69dad3c22c9b7063f4eb9ba9ca17b930432a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1274303759,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjc0MzAzNzU5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Formats","name":"component=Formats","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25711/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25711/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/25711/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/55c4b51a0225fd51204e3b6156e33b925d1ffc57","head":{"label":"dyccode:upg_orc","ref":"upg_orc","sha":"55c4b51a0225fd51204e3b6156e33b925d1ffc57","user":{"login":"dyccode","id":33508807,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNTA4ODA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33508807?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dyccode","html_url":"https://github.com/dyccode","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dyccode/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dyccode/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dyccode/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dyccode/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dyccode/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dyccode/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dyccode/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dyccode/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dyccode/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":888510355,"node_id":"R_kgDONPWXkw","name":"flink","full_name":"dyccode/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dyccode","id":33508807,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNTA4ODA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33508807?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dyccode","html_url":"https://github.com/dyccode","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dyccode/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dyccode/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dyccode/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dyccode/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dyccode/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dyccode/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dyccode/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dyccode/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dyccode/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dyccode/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nremove the CHARACTER_FILTER.filterCharacters function when notify dimension values.\r\n\r\nThe CHARACTER_FILTER.filterCharacters was added because Prometheus gateway does not support invalid characters in metric names. However, for metric values, the Prometheus gateway does not have such restrictions. \r\n\r\nRefer to the documentation: https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/writing_exporters.\r\n \r\nTherefore, removing this functionality will have no impact and will also support Chinese characters in metric values, making it easier to filter metric values with Chinese characters.","created_at":"2024-11-29T09:07:58Z","updated_at":"2025-01-07T07:45:53Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4675fcc2b38f69f44dc7bcfa7ef2b1f9bacfb7d5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273342730,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMzQyNzMw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Metrics","name":"component=Runtime/Metrics","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25710/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25710/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/25710/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/4440b8563386e088f1accd23df2db8638e76fbe5","head":{"label":"hiliuxg:remove_filter_characters","ref":"remove_filter_characters","sha":"4440b8563386e088f1accd23df2db8638e76fbe5","user":{"login":"hiliuxg","id":39675622,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5Njc1NjIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39675622?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiliuxg","html_url":"https://github.com/hiliuxg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiliuxg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiliuxg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiliuxg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiliuxg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiliuxg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiliuxg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiliuxg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiliuxg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiliuxg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":895628883,"node_id":"R_kgDONWI2Uw","name":"flink","full_name":"hiliuxg/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hiliuxg","id":39675622,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5Njc1NjIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39675622?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiliuxg","html_url":"https://github.com/hiliuxg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiliuxg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiliuxg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiliuxg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiliuxg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiliuxg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiliuxg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiliuxg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiliuxg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiliuxg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hiliuxg/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nSupport ignoreIfExists for createTable. Works exactly the same way for other resources, like createFunction. Similar to SQL's `IF NOT EXISTS`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Added one more signature for TableEnvironment's createTable supporting ignoreIfExists\r\n  - Added testCreateTableIfNotExistsFromDescriptor\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - Added test that validates that running createTable, with ignoreIfExists set to true, for an existing table leads to a no op.

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nSupport ignoreIfExists for createTable. Works exactly the same way for other resources, like createFunction. Similar to SQL's `IF NOT EXISTS`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Added one more signature for TableEnvironment's createTable supporting ignoreIfExists\r\n  - Added testCreateTableIfNotExistsFromDescriptor\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - Added test that validates that running createTable, with ignoreIfExists set to true, for an existing table leads to a no op.

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follow [the conventions for tests defined in our code quality guide](https://flink.apache.org/how-to-contribute/code-style-and-quality-common/#7-testing).\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Introduce an executor to run the script.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Introduce printer to print the statement and results on the console.*\r\n  - *Introduce executor to run the statement one by one*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follow [the conventions for tests defined in our code quality guide](https://flink.apache.org/how-to-contribute/code-style-and-quality-common/#7-testing).\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - *Introduce printer test to verify the style.*\r\n  - *Introduce ScriptExecutorITCase to verify the execution results: the input contains all kinds of statements*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nWhen `SqlOrderBy` and `SqlSelect` are validated together, `SqlSelect` gets rewritten and updated in place (as seen in `SqlValidatorImpl#performUnconditionalRewrites`). \r\nThis bug was caused by validation of `SqlOrderBy` and `SqlSelect` multi times, which led to `SqlSelect` being incorrectly updated to a pattern like:\r\n```\r\nSELECT `V`.`b`, `V`.`c`, `V`.`d`\r\nFROM (VALUES ROW(1, 1, 2, 'd1'),\r\nROW(2, 2, 4, 'd2')) AS `V` (`a`, `b`, `c`, `d`)\r\nORDER BY `V`.`a`\r\nORDER BY `a`\r\n``` \r\n\r\nThis pull request aims to prevent the multiple validations of `SqlOrderBy` and `SqlSelect`.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Update logic in SqlCreateTableConverter to avoid validating SqlOrderBy and SqlSelect multi times*\r\n  - *Add tests to verify this bug*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nSome tests in batch mode are added to verify this fix. (Sort in streaming mode is not supported yet).\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  -

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follow [the conventions for tests defined in our code quality guide](https://flink.apache.org/how-to-contribute/code-style-and-quality-common/#7-testing).\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2024-11-26T15:11:06Z","updated_at":"2024-11-26T22:47:13Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5167a3cbe2d74b1f57f085d5de46fdf889355c0f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25696/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25696/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/25696/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/e99f992d2182b158942034fc47f49bd895619c1e","head":{"label":"fapaul:pin-wildfly","ref":"pin-wildfly","sha":"e99f992d2182b158942034fc47f49bd895619c1e","user":{"login":"fapaul","id":7405553,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MDU1NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7405553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul","html_url":"https://github.com/fapaul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":246338488,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNDYzMzg0ODg=","name":"flink","full_name":"fapaul/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fapaul","id":7405553,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MDU1NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7405553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul","html_url":"https://github.com/fapaul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fapaul/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follow [the conventions for tests defined in our code quality guide](https://flink.apache.org/how-to-contribute/code-style-and-quality-common/#7-testing).\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis change upgrades hadoop-aws, which is part of flink-s3-fs-base, to 3.3.6. Internally, it upgrades the wildfly-openssl dependency to fix CVE-2019-14887.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Simple version bump from 3.3.4 -> 3.3.6\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nExisting tests\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (**yes** / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (**yes** / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis pull request aims to split constructor of generated code if it is too large to be compiled.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Override visitConstructorDeclaration to split it into multiple void functions.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follow [the conventions for tests defined in our code quality guide](https://flink.apache.org/how-to-contribute/code-style-and-quality-common/#7-testing).\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *org.apache.flink.table.codesplit.JavaCodeSplitterTest#testSplitJavaCode*.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2024-11-26T01:08:23Z","updated_at":"2024-11-26T21:25:03Z","closed_at":"2024-11-26T21:25:02Z","merged_at":"2024-11-26T21:25:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"c70523b1857470df84d5c2d47eaf33f81856f541","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1289893384,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjg5ODkzMzg0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/API","name":"component=TableSQL/API","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1291537903,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjkxNTM3OTAz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/Runtime","name":"component=TableSQL/Runtime","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25689/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25689/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/25689/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/719be66b992264041c1854ed7049538b95a3cee8","head":{"label":"littleeleventhwolf:fix/large-codegen-constructor-1.19","ref":"fix/large-codegen-constructor-1.19","sha":"719be66b992264041c1854ed7049538b95a3cee8","user":{"login":"littleeleventhwolf","id":20592822,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTkyODIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20592822?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/littleeleventhwolf","html_url":"https://github.com/littleeleventhwolf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/littleeleventhwolf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/littleeleventhwolf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/littleeleventhwolf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/littleeleventhwolf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/littleeleventhwolf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/littleeleventhwolf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/littleeleventhwolf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/littleeleventhwolf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/littleeleventhwolf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":501881699,"node_id":"R_kgDOHeobYw","name":"flink","full_name":"littleeleventhwolf/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"littleeleventhwolf","id":20592822,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTkyODIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20592822?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/littleeleventhwolf","html_url":"https://github.com/littleeleventhwolf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/littleeleventhwolf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/littleeleventhwolf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/littleeleventhwolf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/littleeleventhwolf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/littleeleventhwolf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/littleeleventhwolf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/littleeleventhwolf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/littleeleventhwolf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/littleeleventhwolf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/littleeleventhwolf/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis pull request aims to split constructor of generated code if it is too large to be compiled.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Override visitConstructorDeclaration to split it into multiple void functions.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follow [the conventions for tests defined in our code quality guide](https://flink.apache.org/how-to-contribute/code-style-and-quality-common/#7-testing).\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *org.apache.flink.table.codesplit.JavaCodeSplitterTest#testSplitJavaCode*.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2024-11-26T01:07:32Z","updated_at":"2024-11-26T21:24:09Z","closed_at":"2024-11-26T21:24:09Z","merged_at":"2024-11-26T21:24:08Z","merge_commit_sha":"35a58f7a61a637ce930d5e11bc144c704766d293","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1289893384,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjg5ODkzMzg0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/API","name":"component=TableSQL/API","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1291537903,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjkxNTM3OTAz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/Runtime","name":"component=TableSQL/Runtime","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25688/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25688/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/25688/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/4977391828b921850b17afe4bcb015258e4e1799","head":{"label":"littleeleventhwolf:fix/large-codegen-constructor-1.20","ref":"fix/large-codegen-constructor-1.20","sha":"4977391828b921850b17afe4bcb015258e4e1799","user":{"login":"littleeleventhwolf","id":20592822,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTkyODIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20592822?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/littleeleventhwolf","html_url":"https://github.com/littleeleventhwolf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/littleeleventhwolf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/littleeleventhwolf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/littleeleventhwolf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/littleeleventhwolf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/littleeleventhwolf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/littleeleventhwolf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/littleeleventhwolf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/littleeleventhwolf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/littleeleventhwolf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":501881699,"node_id":"R_kgDOHeobYw","name":"flink","full_name":"littleeleventhwolf/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"littleeleventhwolf","id":20592822,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTkyODIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20592822?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/littleeleventhwolf","html_url":"https://github.com/littleeleventhwolf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/littleeleventhwolf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/littleeleventhwolf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/littleeleventhwolf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/littleeleventhwolf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/littleeleventhwolf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/littleeleventhwolf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/littleeleventhwolf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/littleeleventhwolf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/littleeleventhwolf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/littleeleventhwolf/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nWith the removal of Sink V1, we missed crucial coverage of the global committer coming from the StandardSinkTopologies. That caused a previous PR #25456 to contain undetected bugs.\r\n\r\nThis PR readds the coverage and fixes the uncovered bugs.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Move GlobalCommitter to flink-runtime\r\n- Add the CommitterInitContext to the GlobalCommitter creation\r\n- Adds coverage and fixes the bug\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\nSinkV2TransformationTranslatorITCase\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (**not applicable** / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2024-11-25T13:49:02Z","updated_at":"2024-11-29T08:11:08Z","closed_at":"2024-11-29T08:11:08Z","merged_at":"2024-11-29T08:11:08Z","merge_commit_sha":"d7bfa77bcabb9b52b7d2420efdeda72dea420506","assignee":{"login":"fapaul","id":7405553,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MDU1NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7405553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul","html_url":"https://github.com/fapaul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"fapaul","id":7405553,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MDU1NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7405553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul","html_url":"https://github.com/fapaul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272993074,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTkzMDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=%3Cnone%3E","name":"component=<none>","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25685/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25685/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/25685/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/960cda3c9bfc3d1eff18eac45138cd0bd319b12c","head":{"label":"AHeise:FLINK-36788-cover-global-committer","ref":"FLINK-36788-cover-global-committer","sha":"960cda3c9bfc3d1eff18eac45138cd0bd319b12c","user":{"login":"AHeise","id":4559103,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NTkxMDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4559103?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise","html_url":"https://github.com/AHeise","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":433929054,"node_id":"R_kgDOGd07Xg","name":"flink","full_name":"AHeise/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AHeise","id":4559103,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NTkxMDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4559103?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise","html_url":"https://github.com/AHeise","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AHeise/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nfix memory leaks\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Wait for future to complete to avoid memory leaks\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix PausableRelativeClock does not pause when the source only has one split.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - Pause the mainInputActivityClock when SourceOperator is waiting for alignment\r\n  - Pause the split even if the sourceOperator only has one split\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis adds a new test case.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (**not applicable** / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2024-11-22T09:31:59Z","updated_at":"2024-11-25T16:54:50Z","closed_at":"2024-11-25T16:54:50Z","merged_at":"2024-11-25T16:54:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"0c338ae6d21e6d3dc79764e7801cbb7adfe6a44f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273055469,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMDU1NDY5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=API/DataStream","name":"component=API/DataStream","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25678/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25678/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/25678/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/8dec9dea86fd0d63f3d9593ceec80476b5c1a2c4","head":{"label":"haishui126:FLINK-36751","ref":"FLINK-36751","sha":"8dec9dea86fd0d63f3d9593ceec80476b5c1a2c4","user":{"login":"haishui126","id":38451247,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDUxMjQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38451247?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haishui126","html_url":"https://github.com/haishui126","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haishui126/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haishui126/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haishui126/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haishui126/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haishui126/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haishui126/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haishui126/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haishui126/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haishui126/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":892397572,"node_id":"R_kgDONTDoBA","name":"flink","full_name":"haishui126/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"haishui126","id":38451247,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDUxMjQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38451247?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haishui126","html_url":"https://github.com/haishui126","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haishui126/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haishui126/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haishui126/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haishui126/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haishui126/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haishui126/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haishui126/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haishui126/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haishui126/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/haishui126/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR implements rescaling for ForStStateBackend. The optimization of `IngestDB + clipDB` is also availiable.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n- Support `iterate + insert` rescaling in `ForStIncrementalRestoreOperation`.\r\n- Support `IngestDB + deleteRange` rescaling in `ForStIncrementalRestoreOperation`.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follow [the conventions for tests defined in our code quality guide](https://flink.apache.org/how-to-contribute/code-style-and-quality-common/#7-testing).\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n- Enable `ForStStateBackendTest`\r\n- Add `ForStIncrementalCheckpointRescalingTest` for ForStSyncKeyedStateBackend.\r\n- Add `StateBackendTestV2Base#testAsyncStateBackendScaleUp` and `StateBackendTestV2Base#testAsyncStateBackendScaleDown` for ForStKeyedStateBackend\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (JavaDocs)\r\n","created_at":"2024-11-22T08:50:48Z","updated_at":"2025-01-14T02:36:20Z","closed_at":"2024-12-16T08:42:46Z","merged_at":"2024-12-16T08:42:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"96773507be249c53eabba1f4468f151117e82de1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272993074,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTkzMDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=%3Cnone%3E","name":"component=<none>","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25676/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25676/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/25676/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/604513d6d5ac2a077b36a402262cf5122326015b","head":{"label":"fredia:sync_rescale","ref":"sync_rescale","sha":"604513d6d5ac2a077b36a402262cf5122326015b","user":{"login":"fredia","id":18653940,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUzOTQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18653940?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia","html_url":"https://github.com/fredia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":375962860,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzU5NjI4NjA=","name":"flink","full_name":"fredia/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fredia","id":18653940,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUzOTQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18653940?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia","html_url":"https://github.com/fredia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fredia/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follow [the conventions for tests defined in our code quality guide](https://flink.apache.org/how-to-contribute/code-style-and-quality-common/#7-testing).\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2024-11-22T05:50:54Z","updated_at":"2024-11-22T05:52:46Z","closed_at":"2024-11-22T05:52:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fbca7bfd50ba6df34eda2a8a56c4920d382c8d3f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25675/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25675/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/25675/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/81b6f821cb10e59c4281aae5399b49d9076df547","head":{"label":"linkedin:abhishekmendhekar-test-branch","ref":"abhishekmendhekar-test-branch","sha":"81b6f821cb10e59c4281aae5399b49d9076df547","user":{"login":"linkedin","id":357098,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjM1NzA5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/357098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin","html_url":"https://github.com/linkedin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":307532333,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMDc1MzIzMzM=","name":"flink","full_name":"linkedin/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"linkedin","id":357098,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjM1NzA5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/357098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin","html_url":"https://github.com/linkedin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/linkedin/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Relax the limitation that application mode requires a main jar.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Remove the check that `pipeline.jar` must have one jar*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - *Add tests to get packaged program if `pipeline.jar` is empty*\r\n  - *Add tests to deploy a cluster if `pipeline.jar` is empty*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (**yes** / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / **not documented**)\r\n","created_at":"2024-11-22T03:33:26Z","updated_at":"2024-11-25T11:11:44Z","closed_at":"2024-11-25T11:11:44Z","merged_at":"2024-11-25T11:11:44Z","merge_commit_sha":"44da52d0964252fa292935137a3308dcc8f2847a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272992926,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTkyOTI2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Deployment/YARN","name":"component=Deployment/YARN","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1278776326,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjc4Nzc2MzI2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Deployment/Kubernetes","name":"component=Deployment/Kubernetes","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25674/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25674/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/25674/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/9efb250538e179895ee1f96837a72051fa9b0a34","head":{"label":"fsk119:relax","ref":"relax","sha":"9efb250538e179895ee1f96837a72051fa9b0a34","user":{"login":"fsk119","id":33114724,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMTE0NzI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33114724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119","html_url":"https://github.com/fsk119","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":270591305,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzA1OTEzMDU=","name":"flink","full_name":"fsk119/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fsk119","id":33114724,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMTE0NzI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33114724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119","html_url":"https://github.com/fsk119","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fsk119/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\nFix miss semicolon on SELECT & WHERE clause example sql.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\nAdd semicolon for miss semicolon example sql.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nSince the changes affect the doc examples and there are no tests. I copied the snippets and verified (compiled) them locally.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2024-11-22T03:04:25Z","updated_at":"2024-11-26T02:04:25Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"809068512ee2cb812c6b855c697f9a29e4875f74","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25673/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25673/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/25673/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/4740ab5775e6045fbc62736e2a60f75ea4463812","head":{"label":"camilesing:hot_fix_miss_semicolon","ref":"hot_fix_miss_semicolon","sha":"4740ab5775e6045fbc62736e2a60f75ea4463812","user":{"login":"camilesing","id":11649145,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjQ5MTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11649145?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/camilesing","html_url":"https://github.com/camilesing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camilesing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camilesing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camilesing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camilesing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camilesing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camilesing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camilesing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camilesing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camilesing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":368115809,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNjgxMTU4MDk=","name":"flink","full_name":"camilesing/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"camilesing","id":11649145,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjQ5MTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11649145?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/camilesing","html_url":"https://github.com/camilesing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camilesing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camilesing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camilesing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camilesing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camilesing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camilesing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camilesing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camilesing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/camilesing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/camilesing/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nHi, community. Currently, in the batch verification scenario of our algorithm data, we use pyflink and encounter low transmission efficiency caused by low performance of pickle4-based encoding. After research, we decided to adopt Apache fury, a serialization framework based on pickle5 encoding. The implementation of fury in python will define the transmission buffer size in the protocol for transmission to improve the performance of large data transmission.\r\n\r\nRelated communications with fury community members can be found [here](https://github.com/apache/fury/issues/1919)\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follow [the conventions for tests defined in our code quality guide](https://flink.apache.org/how-to-contribute/code-style-and-quality-common/#7-testing).\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-36739\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis pull request raises the version of the NodeJS module which is a pre-requisite to upgrade dependencies in order to address vulnerabilities in Runtime/WebFrontend component. \r\nThere will be another PR to fix vulnerabilities once this is merged.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nNodeJS is v22.11.0/Npm is 10.9.0\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThe Flink UI should be accessible without any difference\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive):

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix enviroment variable name inconsistence in code snippet.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Change `tableEnv` to `tEnv` for both `Java` and `Scala`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nSince the changes affect the doc examples and there are no tests. I copied the snippets and verified (compiled) them locally.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*We wanted to skip some batch related tests for adaptive-scheduler in ccb9bc27. Unfortunately, these test classes are based on Junit5, and using `Category` does not take effect. This can be fixed via using `Tag` in Juint5.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nUse Tag to replace some incorrectly used Category annotation for skipping adaptvie-scheduler test\r\n\r\n\r\n##

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nExamples on documentation page [Data Sources](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-master/docs/dev/datastream/sources/) have been using the APIs that do not exist anymore in Flink 2.0-preview.\r\n\r\n- FixedSizeSplitFetcherManager uses a SplitFetcherManager constructor that accepts elements queue and was removed in Flink 2.0-preview https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-36245\r\n- FixedFetcherSizeSourceReader uses  uses a SourceReaderBase constructor that accepts elements queue and was removed in Flink 2.0-preview https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-36245\r\n- FixedFetcherSizeSourceReader uses getInteger method of Configuration that was removed in in Flink 2.0-preview https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-34082\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - switch FixedSizeSplitFetcherManager, FixedFetcherSizeSourceReader to use proper constructors of their super classes\r\n  - switch from getInteger to get method of the Configuration class\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- Since the changes affect the doc examples and there are no tests. I copied the snippets and verified (compiled) them locally.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? not applicable\r\n","created_at":"2024-11-18T18:38:38Z","updated_at":"2024-12-10T10:48:33Z","closed_at":"2024-12-10T10:48:33Z","merged_at":"2024-12-10T10:48:33Z","merge_commit_sha":"6951686be5691dc855b6d07d575535ac239670da","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272994186,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MTg2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Documentation","name":"component=Documentation","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273210700,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMjEwNzAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Connectors/Common","name":"component=Connectors/Common","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25667/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25667/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/25667/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/062cc2c00c4505dfe89fefc7d530086c200cdc9d","head":{"label":"kaygorodov:FLINK-36745-fix-data-sources-code-snippets","ref":"FLINK-36745-fix-data-sources-code-snippets","sha":"062cc2c00c4505dfe89fefc7d530086c200cdc9d","user":{"login":"kaygorodov","id":1989016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5ODkwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1989016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaygorodov","html_url":"https://github.com/kaygorodov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaygorodov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaygorodov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaygorodov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaygorodov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaygorodov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaygorodov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaygorodov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaygorodov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaygorodov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":591972909,"node_id":"R_kgDOI0jKLQ","name":"flink","full_name":"kaygorodov/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kaygorodov","id":1989016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5ODkwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1989016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaygorodov","html_url":"https://github.com/kaygorodov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaygorodov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaygorodov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaygorodov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaygorodov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaygorodov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaygorodov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaygorodov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaygorodov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaygorodov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kaygorodov/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follow [the conventions for tests defined in our code quality guide](https://flink.apache.org/how-to-contribute/code-style-and-quality-common/#7-testing).\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2024-11-18T17:13:06Z","updated_at":"2024-11-19T10:09:59Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"89d62f35c3a4347ac14c41a88549890eda254642","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25666/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25666/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/25666/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/c0f3072d80f988fdafb6a947b771b36c9683a611","head":{"label":"ammu20-dev:draft-fix","ref":"draft-fix","sha":"c0f3072d80f988fdafb6a947b771b36c9683a611","user":{"login":"ammu20-dev","id":175413337,"node_id":"U_kgDOCnSYWQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/175413337?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ammu20-dev","html_url":"https://github.com/ammu20-dev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ammu20-dev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ammu20-dev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ammu20-dev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ammu20-dev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ammu20-dev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ammu20-dev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ammu20-dev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ammu20-dev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ammu20-dev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":829257896,"node_id":"R_kgDOMW14qA","name":"flink","full_name":"ammu20-dev/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ammu20-dev","id":175413337,"node_id":"U_kgDOCnSYWQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/175413337?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ammu20-dev","html_url":"https://github.com/ammu20-dev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ammu20-dev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ammu20-dev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ammu20-dev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ammu20-dev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ammu20-dev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ammu20-dev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ammu20-dev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ammu20-dev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ammu20-dev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ammu20-dev/flink","description":"Apache

are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follow [the conventions for tests defined in our code quality guide](https://flink.apache.org/how-to-contribute/code-style-and-quality-common/#7-testing).\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2024-11-18T06:25:25Z","updated_at":"2024-11-25T11:12:59Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"569ca725f7f194994687bf54107764c5b7daf36e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25664/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25664/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/25664/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/f1f17daab7e85c20056d0771b7b1c0f1d994dc48","head":{"label":"a4566:patch-6","ref":"patch-6","sha":"f1f17daab7e85c20056d0771b7b1c0f1d994dc48","user":{"login":"a4566","id":103030084,"node_id":"U_kgDOBiQdRA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/103030084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/a4566","html_url":"https://github.com/a4566","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a4566/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a4566/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a4566/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a4566/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a4566/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a4566/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a4566/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a4566/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a4566/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":890094569,"node_id":"R_kgDONQ3D6Q","name":"flink","full_name":"a4566/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"a4566","id":103030084,"node_id":"U_kgDOBiQdRA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/103030084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/a4566","html_url":"https://github.com/a4566","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a4566/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a4566/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a4566/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a4566/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a4566/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a4566/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a4566/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a4566/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a4566/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/a4566/flink","description":"Apache

happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follow [the conventions for tests defined in our code quality guide](https://flink.apache.org/how-to-contribute/code-style-and-quality-common/#7-testing).\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2024-11-18T02:44:24Z","updated_at":"2024-11-24T21:06:19Z","closed_at":"2024-11-24T21:06:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"22f3414edf040213aa2c2cf67627bb14339a6c90","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25663/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25663/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/25663/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/f197cb442d6c9b324bb8b270148f8cc90d3b8d06","head":{"label":"a4566:patch-5","ref":"patch-5","sha":"f197cb442d6c9b324bb8b270148f8cc90d3b8d06","user":{"login":"a4566","id":103030084,"node_id":"U_kgDOBiQdRA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/103030084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/a4566","html_url":"https://github.com/a4566","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a4566/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a4566/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a4566/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a4566/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a4566/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a4566/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a4566/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a4566/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a4566/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":890094569,"node_id":"R_kgDONQ3D6Q","name":"flink","full_name":"a4566/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"a4566","id":103030084,"node_id":"U_kgDOBiQdRA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/103030084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/a4566","html_url":"https://github.com/a4566","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a4566/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a4566/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a4566/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a4566/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a4566/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a4566/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a4566/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a4566/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a4566/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/a4566/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n[FLINK-36068][runtime] Support scheduling based on adaptive job graph.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Support scheduling based on adaptive job graph.\r\n  - Add AdaptiveExecutionHandler  for handling the adaptive execution of batch jobs.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / \r\n  - Add StreamGraphSchedulingContext for providing stream graph context for execution graph)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (**not applicable** / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2024-11-15T08:18:54Z","updated_at":"2024-12-12T10:52:30Z","closed_at":"2024-12-12T10:52:30Z","merged_at":"2024-12-12T10:52:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"1580b4dd53cf023a201f12d822df0f9c1fbe241d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272994322,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MzIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Coordination","name":"component=Runtime/Coordination","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25658/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25658/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/25658/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/e21b60c47e77a6523fe204b756e543f8431809aa","head":{"label":"JunRuiLee:scheduling_based_on_adaptive_job_graph","ref":"scheduling_based_on_adaptive_job_graph","sha":"e21b60c47e77a6523fe204b756e543f8431809aa","user":{"login":"JunRuiLee","id":107924572,"node_id":"U_kgDOBm7MXA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/107924572?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee","html_url":"https://github.com/JunRuiLee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":515412374,"node_id":"R_kgDOHriRlg","name":"flink","full_name":"JunRuiLee/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JunRuiLee","id":107924572,"node_id":"U_kgDOBm7MXA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/107924572?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee","html_url":"https://github.com/JunRuiLee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JunRuiLee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JunRuiLee/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nRemove DefaultExecutionGraph's jobType  (added with https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/24718)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nRemove DefaultExecutionGraph's jobType,  because it can get it from jobInformation\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nn/a\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis pull request fixes the class loading issues when using udf in add jar and enabling checkpointing.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Pulled in the FlinkUserCodeClassLoader for UDF jar loading from the resource manager\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follow [the conventions for tests defined in our code quality guide](https://flink.apache.org/how-to-contribute/code-style-and-quality-common/#7-testing).\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - Added test case to verify ADD JAR with checkpointing in FunctionITCase in flink-table-planner module.\r\n  - Verified that this test case will fail in older versions without the fix.\r\n  - Manually verified the change by running a sample UDF job with checkpointing and verified the working.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: ( no)\r\n  - The serializers: (don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follow [the conventions for tests defined in our code quality guide](https://flink.apache.org/how-to-contribute/code-style-and-quality-common/#7-testing).\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\nFix parquet can not read row with last column is array.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - fix a corner condition.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follow [the conventions for tests defined in our code quality guide](https://flink.apache.org/how-to-contribute/code-style-and-quality-common/#7-testing).\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - modify unit test case to cover the situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper:no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector:no\r\n\r\n##

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follow [the conventions for tests defined in our code quality guide](https://flink.apache.org/how-to-contribute/code-style-and-quality-common/#7-testing).\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2024-11-12T17:45:56Z","updated_at":"2024-11-21T08:57:33Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3886a2cd04a4015fce98017760c7f12ca076bf78","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25649/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25649/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/25649/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/26382e2a4136716f42ad237b48a0047d9a0f32be","head":{"label":"fidelity-contributions:dependabot/maven/com.squareup.okio-okio","ref":"dependabot/maven/com.squareup.okio-okio","sha":"26382e2a4136716f42ad237b48a0047d9a0f32be","user":{"login":"fidelity-contributions","id":108946662,"node_id":"O_kgDOBn5k5g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/108946662?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fidelity-contributions","html_url":"https://github.com/fidelity-contributions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fidelity-contributions/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fidelity-contributions/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fidelity-contributions/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fidelity-contributions/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fidelity-contributions/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fidelity-contributions/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fidelity-contributions/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fidelity-contributions/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fidelity-contributions/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":693197279,"node_id":"R_kgDOKVFZ3w","name":"apache-flink","full_name":"fidelity-contributions/apache-flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fidelity-contributions","id":108946662,"node_id":"O_kgDOBn5k5g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/108946662?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fidelity-contributions","html_url":"https://github.com/fidelity-contributions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fidelity-contributions/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fidelity-contributions/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fidelity-contributions/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fidelity-contributions/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fidelity-contributions/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fidelity-contributions/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fidelity-contributions/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fidelity-contributions/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fidelity-contributions/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fidelity-contributions/apache-flink","description":"Staging fork for Fidelity's contributions to apache/flink.

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n- [FLINK-35966][runtime] Introduce the TASKS for TaskManagerLoadBalanceMode enum\r\n- [FLINK-36691][runtime] Support configuration to enable tasks balancing at slot level for Default Scheduler\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- [FLINK-35966][runtime] Introduce the TASKS for TaskManagerLoadBalanceMode enum\r\n- [FLINK-36691][runtime] Support configuration to enable tasks balancing at slot level for Default Scheduler\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, \r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (**yes** / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (**yes** / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (**yes** / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / **docs** / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2024-11-12T14:39:59Z","updated_at":"2024-12-06T12:48:40Z","closed_at":"2024-12-06T12:48:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0ec7aeb779311ca03496a71f9163b23716aec7a6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272994322,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MzIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Coordination","name":"component=Runtime/Coordination","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25647/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25647/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/25647/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/17a1b97fbd6217b890c80dcf9f72b3500d2550ca","head":{"label":"RocMarshal:FLINK-35966","ref":"FLINK-35966","sha":"17a1b97fbd6217b890c80dcf9f72b3500d2550ca","user":{"login":"RocMarshal","id":64569824,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NTY5ODI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64569824?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal","html_url":"https://github.com/RocMarshal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":260947074,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjA5NDcwNzQ=","name":"flink","full_name":"RocMarshal/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"RocMarshal","id":64569824,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NTY5ODI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64569824?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal","html_url":"https://github.com/RocMarshal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/RocMarshal/flink","description":"Apache

XML_TRANSFORM and EXTRACT_VALUE do not restrict XML External Entity references in their configuration, which makes them vulnerable to a potential XML External Entity (XXE) attack. Therefore any client exposing these operators, typically by using Oracle dialect (the first three) or MySQL dialect (the last one), is affected by this vulnerability (the extent of it will depend on the user under which the application is running).

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number.

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nImplement native full checkpoint for ForStSyncKeyedStateBackend and ForStKeyedStateBackend.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n- Introduce `ForStNativeFullSnapshotStrategy`\r\n- Integrate `ForStNativeFullSnapshotStrategy/ForStIncrementalSnapshotStrategy` to `ForStSyncKeyedStateBackend`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change can be verified as follows:\r\n- `ForStIncrementalSnapshotStrategyTest#testCheckpointIsIncremental`\r\n- `ForStStateBackendTest#testEmptyStateCheckpointing`\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes two issues about RescaleCheckpointManuallyITCase:\r\n\r\n - The `RescaleCheckpointManuallyITCase#CollectionSink` collects elements into a single static collection, which might be a problem when multiple tests run in parallel.\r\n - The `RescaleCheckpointManuallyITCase`  does not ensure all the data from the first job has being processed and snapshotted before it performs a rescale, resulting in some data loss in the final aggregation result. This can be easily reproduced by setting the param `checkpointingInterval` of `createJobGraphWithKeyedState` as 20 or less.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n - Refactor `RescaleCheckpointManuallyITCase#CollectionSink`, decouple the data from different jobs.\r\n - Change `RescaleCheckpointManuallyITCase$NotifyingDefiniteKeySource#waitCheckpointCompleted` and its related logic, making it wait a complete checkpoint before quit.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis changes test itself, can be verified by running `RescaleCheckpointManuallyITCase`. I have run the test 250 times and it looks good.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? not applicable\r\n","created_at":"2024-11-12T05:52:16Z","updated_at":"2024-11-13T02:33:37Z","closed_at":"2024-11-13T02:33:35Z","merged_at":"2024-11-13T02:33:35Z","merge_commit_sha":"6fe39c65581075dff55196c2e79d7c1b1c9047ca","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273164140,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMTY0MTQw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Tests","name":"component=Tests","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273376312,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMzc2MzEy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Checkpointing","name":"component=Runtime/Checkpointing","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25642/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/25642/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/25642/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/bf5ac8d12432ca7f714685f54f59a3fe0af49d64","head":{"label":"Zakelly:f36613","ref":"f36613","sha":"bf5ac8d12432ca7f714685f54f59a3fe0af49d64","user":{"login":"Zakelly","id":2986149,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODYxNDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2986149?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly","html_url":"https://github.com/Zakelly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":263260000,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjMyNjAwMDA=","name":"flink","full_name":"Zakelly/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Zakelly","id":2986149,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODYxNDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2986149?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly","html_url":"https://github.com/Zakelly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zakelly/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Zakelly/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis is a subtask of [[FLINK-36476](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-36476)](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-36476) Remove all deprecated methods under public APIs in table modules\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nRemove deprecated method\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follow [the conventions for tests defined in our code quality guide](https://flink.apache.org/how-to-contribute/code-style-and-quality-common/#7-testing).\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): ( no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently, the `ForSt` needs a `FileSystem` instance from `Flink` side, but it is created by a JNI call from `ForSt`.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n* Adds Compiled Plan annotations to BatchExecOverAggregate.\r\n* Tests the new annotations with the existing TestPrograms.\r\n* Moves the existing OverAggregateTestPrograms and makes it clear which ones have out-of-order data.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change adds a BatchRestoreTest to cover the new annotations and show that the batch compiled plan can be restored and executed correctly.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a
