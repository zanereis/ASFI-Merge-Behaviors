is described in Flume-3342, renaming a file may cause data duplication. But moreover, if the original file was opened by flume before and not closed yet, flume reopens it while not freeing its original file handles. And then I delete the new file, but after the idle time, flume just closes the new file handle and forgets to close its original file handles, leading to a handle leak. It can be found by \"lsof | grep \"deleted\".\r\n\r\nThis bug is triggered by using Log4j to roll log files. To avoid losing data when rolling, I use regex to include both current log file and old log files in the taildir

added the current year based on the system time,\r\nnot the (mocked) Clock instance.\r\nWhen the test date was 2020-02-29 (so the syslog message contained Feb 29), SyslogSource added\r\n2019 to Feb 29 which is not a real date and was parsed to 2019-03-01, then adjusted with +1 year\r\nto 2020-03-01. This caused the test error.\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\nSyslogSource has been modified to use the Clock instance when adding the current year to the\r\ndate coming in the syslog message.\r\nThe year was also set in another place in the code which was redundant (and used deprecated\r\nDate API), so it has been deleted too.","created_at":"2019-01-31T10:58:48Z","updated_at":"2019-01-31T12:52:20Z","closed_at":"2019-01-31T12:52:20Z","merged_at":"2019-01-31T12:52:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"41902ebc998ca31de4ddc0fb89136a2e70b236f9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/logging-flume/pulls/275/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/logging-flume/pulls/275/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/logging-flume/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/logging-flume/issues/275/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/logging-flume/statuses/54a1ac00a73ec740d36f628a194808cb75d94036","head":{"label":"turcsanyip:FLUME-3316","ref":"FLUME-3316","sha":"54a1ac00a73ec740d36f628a194808cb75d94036","user":{"login":"turcsanyip","id":35004384,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MDA0Mzg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35004384?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip","html_url":"https://github.com/turcsanyip","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":132133894,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzIxMzM4OTQ=","name":"flume","full_name":"turcsanyip/flume","private":false,"owner":{"login":"turcsanyip","id":35004384,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MDA0Mzg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35004384?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip","html_url":"https://github.com/turcsanyip","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/turcsanyip/flume","description":"Mirror

there are multiple files in the path(s) that need to be tailed and there\r\nis a file written by high frequency, then Taildir can read the batchSize size\r\nevents from that file every time. This can lead to an endless loop and Taildir\r\nwill only read data from the busy file, while other files will not be\r\nprocessed.\r\nAnother problem is that in this case TaildirSource will be unresponsive to\r\nstop requests too.\r\n\r\nThis commit handles this situation by introducing a new config property called\r\nmaxBatchCount. It controls the number of batches being read consecutively\r\nfrom the same file. After reading maxBatchCount rounds from a file, Taildir\r\nwill switch to another file / will have a break in the processing.\r\n\r\nThis change is based on hunshenshi's

has been tested with unit tests. The main difference that caused the most problems is the consumer.poll(Duration) change. This does not block even when it fetches meta data whereas the previous poll(long timeout) blocked indefinitely for meta data fetching.\r\nThis has resulted in many test timing issues. I tried to do minimal changes at the tests, just enough to make them pass.\r\n\r\nKafka 2.0 requires a higher version for slf4j, I had to update it to 1.7.25.\r\n\r\nOption migrateZookeeperOffsets is deprecated in this PR. This will allow us to get rid of Kafka server libraries in Flume.\r\n\r\nCompatibility testing. \r\nModified the TestUtil to be able to use external servers. This way I could test against a variety of Kafka Server versions using the normal unit tests. \r\nChannel tests using 2.0.1 client:\r\nKafka_2.11-0.11.0.3 - timeouts in TestPartitions when creating topics\r\nKafka_2.11-1.0.2 - passed\r\nKafka_2.11-1.1.1 - passed\r\nKafka_2.11-2.0.1 - passed \r\n\r\nI will publish further results here, today or

the newer version of the Syslog message format (RFC-5424) the hostname\r\nis not a mandatory header anymore so the Syslog client might not send it.\r\nOn the Flume side it would be a useful information that could be used\r\nin interceptors or for event routing.\r\nTo keep this information, two new properties have been added to the Syslog\r\nsources: clientIPHeader and clientHostnameHeader.\r\nFlume users can define custom event header names through these parameters\r\nfor storing the IP address / hostname of the Syslog client in the Flume\r\nevent as headers.\r\nThe IP address / hostname are retrieved from the underlying network sockets,\r\nnot from the Syslog message.\r\n\r\nThis change is based on the patch submitted by Jinjiang Ling which has been\r\nrebased onto the current trunk and the review comments have been implemented.","created_at":"2018-11-08T18:21:24Z","updated_at":"2018-11-14T12:27:27Z","closed_at":"2018-11-14T12:27:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f3aa4764ea27571ae564710750ace2025be49529","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/logging-flume/pulls/234/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/logging-flume/pulls/234/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/logging-flume/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/logging-flume/issues/234/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/logging-flume/statuses/adbb65838a137da68f09993fc1cdf874f606fedb","head":{"label":"turcsanyip:FLUME-3133","ref":"FLUME-3133","sha":"adbb65838a137da68f09993fc1cdf874f606fedb","user":{"login":"turcsanyip","id":35004384,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MDA0Mzg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35004384?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip","html_url":"https://github.com/turcsanyip","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":132133894,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzIxMzM4OTQ=","name":"flume","full_name":"turcsanyip/flume","private":false,"owner":{"login":"turcsanyip","id":35004384,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MDA0Mzg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35004384?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip","html_url":"https://github.com/turcsanyip","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turcsanyip/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/turcsanyip/flume","description":"Mirror

is based on @mcsanady 's original pull request #202 \r\nI took the test changes from him but reworked the new feature implementation since it failed some unit tests.\r\nPreviously when a close failed we immediately did a recover lease. This PR introduces a background retry mechanism. It uses the already existing \"hdfs.closeTries\" parameter. Unfortunately it has infinite retries by default, that seems a bit too long for me.\r\n\r\nI also did a minimal code clean up. The most important is that   HDFSWriter writer in BucketWriter became final. This is essential for later use in inner classes. Only some testing solutions made it not final. I reworked those to use the

introducing error counters it will be easier to monitor problems. Also errors are categorized, hopefully this will help setting up better monitoring solutions.\r\nConcept: an error is when an Exception is thrown or an ERROR level log is written during event processing.\r\nIn case of an error at least 1 error counter is increased at least once. (Preferably 1 counter once).\r\nErrors during event processing are counted. Initialization errors are not handled here.\r\n3 types of errors are differentiated.\r\n-Channel read/write errors from the channel when the channel throws a ChannelException.\r\n-Event read/write errors. E.g: A source cannot read an event due to \r\n-Generic errors - e.g.: TaildirSource cannot write position
