SUMMARY\r\nIf a filter box uses data that the user shouldn't have access to, they don't currently get restricted from using the filter box. This is because filterboxes are kinda hacky to begin with, and it looks like we don't check permissions for the extra queries it runs. This PR builds a QueryContext for each query the filterbox runs and calls `raise_for_access` on it. Then we catch that exception and set the error on the response if it fails.\r\n\r\nThe big thing I'm unhappy with here is the import within the `run_extra_queries` function o_O I tried to get around this, but circular imports were pretty impossible here... Would love it if others have better thoughts about how to resolve this.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nManually test with a FilterBox that accesses data I don't have access to, see the failure. See it pass when I do have access to the data.\r\n\r\nNo unit tests currently exist for the `FilterBox` viz. I've got the sense that this will be deprecated soon so ü§∑ \r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nBetter error message when the displayed rows in SQL Lab are limited to 10000. Based on user feedback, currently the error is not very actionable for user, because the displayed rows are limited to 10000 but if user selected higher limit (e.g. 100 000) in the dropdown limit, they can still get more results (up to the max rows limit base don config) when downloading CSV. Alternatively they can add filters and rerun the query to get less results.\r\n\r\nThis new warning message clarifies this for the user making the error more actionable.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER

SUMMARY\r\nBetter error message when the displayed rows in SQL Lab are limited to 10000. Based on user feedback, currently the error is not very actionable for user, because the displayed rows are limited to 10000 but if user selected higher limit (e.g. 100 000) in the dropdown limit, they can still get more results (up to the max rows limit base don config) when downloading CSV. Alternatively they can add filters and rerun the query to get less results. \r\n\r\nThis new warning message clarifies this for the user making the error more actionable.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER

component which encapsulates request handling, loader rendering and proper error handling.\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\nIn the filter tab modal, filters render correctly:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/112715070-d6a9b300-8ee6-11eb-8453-b5e7f72b7b09.png)\r\nIn the filter config modal, the default value component renders properly:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/112715142-6e0f0600-8ee7-11eb-950d-2a753a8a3670.png)\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\nIn the filter tab, all filters show up as \"No

SUMMARY\r\nWhen debugging a performance issue today, I ran into a situation where a stacked bar chart had about 20k series, but all of them except 1 were filled with 0s and Nones. This took ~1 minute to render in a dashboard and froze chrome.\r\n\r\nThis PR removes empty time series from time series visualizations. I'm not sure what the consequences of this might be, so would appreciate feedback from folks. If this seems reasonable, then I'll follow up by adding some tests.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nCI\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include

SUMMARY\r\nThe PR #13625 introduced a regression in the native filters feature, causing existing filter configurations to not show up on the Filter Tab and making it impossible to save affected dashboards. The reason for the regression was that the `filter_configuration` property in the dashboard's `json_metadata` object that contains all native filters had changed name to `native_filter_configuration`.\r\n\r\nThis PR migrates all existing dashboards that include native filter configurations from using the now deprecated `filter_configuration` to the new `native_filter_configuration`. Dashboards that were already using the new name are unaffected. The migration also limits the migration to dashboards that have native filter configurations, making this migration fairly light weight (won't touch any rows if the native filters feature was not activated).\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n1) Tested that a dashboard with the old metadata failed to load existing native filters and failed to update metadata\r\n2) Tested up migration, and made sure it only modified dashboards with the old `filter_configuration` property to use the new `native_filter_configuration` property. Also made sure the dashboards loaded the filter configurations correctly, and were able to to save updated metadata.\r\n3) Tested down migration, and made sure it changed the dashboards to use the old `filter_configuration` property. Also reran the up migration, and made sure dashboards with native filters were working again.\r\n \r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Requires DB Migration.\r\n- [ ] Confirm DB Migration upgrade and downgrade

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nCurrently, reading execution logs for alerts and reports can be confusing.  Several log entries can be created by a single execution run, but nothing indicates that they are part of the same execution, except that they have the same timestamp.\r\n\r\nThis PR gives each execution a UUID which is truncated to 6 characters on the execution log view.  This way, it will be much easier to tell which log entries belong to which execution.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n![Screen Shot 2021-03-23 at 1 33 22

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nBugfixes for a couple of engine-specific issues in SQLA generator:\r\n\r\n1. Issue 1 in #13228 (in Presto, SELECT alias cannot be the same as a source column if used in ORDER BY). \r\n2. ORDER BY metrics in Hive could not reference a metric not used in SELECT.\r\n\r\nAdding two `DBEngineSpec` attributes to handle these cases. We can potentially just: 1) always use random strings for column aliases; 2) always add ORDER BY metrics to SELECT, but adding these flags helps keep the generated SQL clean.\r\n\r\n\r\nCloses #13228 \r\nCloses #13426\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n### Presto / Before\r\n\r\nWhen a metric has a label named the same as an existing column, adding \"Sort by\" aggregations on this column will generate invalid Presto queries and throw an error:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"902\" alt=\"dup-alias-before-query\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/335541/112191181-fda07600-8bc2-11eb-9731-58fcc2aac439.png\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"881\" alt=\"dup-alias-before\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/335541/112191148-f4170e00-8bc2-11eb-91ba-817525271407.png\">\r\n\r\nThe root cause in Presto is https://github.com/prestodb/presto/issues/4698 but it seems Presto has no plan to fix this issue.\r\n\r\n### Presto / After\r\n\r\n<img width=\"867\" alt=\"dup-alias-after\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/335541/112191517-55d77800-8bc3-11eb-87fe-66d6449b4996.png\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"905\" alt=\"dup-alias-after-query\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/335541/112191538-5a039580-8bc3-11eb-8477-67ee4396501e.png\">\r\n\r\nColumn alias in the SELECT query was updated but it shouldn't affect column names in charts (including the Data preview panel) because columns are updated post-query anyway.\r\n\r\n### Hive / Before\r\n\r\n<img width=\"894\" alt=\"hive-before\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/335541/112191772-959e5f80-8bc3-11eb-884f-47eb8ec9b86d.png\">\r\n\r\nSort by metrics (aggregation clause) are directly created in ORDER BY, which doesn't work in Hive. It throws a \"Invalid table alias or column reference\" error.\r\n\r\n### Hive / After\r\n\r\n<img width=\"893\" alt=\"hive-after\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/335541/112191999-cbdbdf00-8bc3-11eb-947b-190c7a94166d.png\">\r\n\r\nAlways add ORDER BY clauses to select and use aliases to reference them in ORDER BY.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\nManually tested with local Presto and Hive clusters. To start your own, run these commands:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# start a Presto cluster in the foreground\r\ndocker run -d -p 127.0.0.1:17777:8080 --name presto starburstdata/presto\r\n\r\n# Start a local Hive cluster in the foreground\r\ndocker-compose -f scripts/databases/hive/docker-compose.yml up\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen create new Databases in Superset.\r\n\r\nGo to SQL Lab, use this query to create a sample virtual table:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT name, score\r\nFROM (\r\n  SELECT 'aaa' as name, 1.1231 as score\r\n  UNION\r\n  SELECT 'bac', 0.39e-14\r\n  UNION\r\n  SELECT 'aaa', 10e19\r\n) t\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso added some unit tests.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR switches to using Kubernetes' stringData field for Secrets instead of the data field. The benefits are:\r\n* we can avoid the manual base64 encoding of every field\r\n* when templating the helm chart, you can actually read the secrets and therefore better validate the generated template (e.g. injected config values).\r\n\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThe execution log view for the alerts and reports feature has two timestamp columns which are currently formatted differently.  Additionally, there is nothing indicating the timezone for this data (UTC).\r\n\r\nThis PR unifies these formats and adds an indicator in the column headers that the data is in UTC.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n###

SUMMARY\r\nQuerying a column that returns only `null` values in a bar chart such as `sum(num_boys) + null` currently results in an error because `df.pivot_table()` [by default has `dropna=True`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.pivot_table.html#pandas.pivot_table):\r\n >    Do not include columns whose entries are all NaN.\r\n \r\n The behaviour before superset version 1.0.1 was to show those values in the chart with a `NULL` value, which is what this PR does\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR is to fix a logic bug in dashboard filter scope. \r\nWhen calculate filter's scope, if a filter applicable to multiple child nodes (like sub-tab(s), and a chart), we _aggregate_ the filter scope up to their common parent node level, and mark those chart type children that not applicable to the filter as _immune_. The bug was in the _aggregate_ function, which didn't collect all the immune charts.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nadded new unit test.
