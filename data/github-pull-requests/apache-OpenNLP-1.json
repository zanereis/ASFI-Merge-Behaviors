href=\"https://github.com/apsonawane\"><code>@​apsonawane</code></a></strong></p>\n<h1>Announcements</h1>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>All ONNX Runtime Training packages have been deprecated.</strong> ORT 1.19.2 was the last release for which onnxruntime-training (PyPI), onnxruntime-training-cpu (PyPI), Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime.Training (Nuget), onnxruntime-training-c (CocoaPods), onnxruntime-training-objc (CocoaPods), and onnxruntime-training-android (Maven Central) were published.</li>\n<li><strong>ONNX Runtime packages will stop supporting Python 3.8 and Python 3.9.</strong> This decision aligns with NumPy Python version support. To continue using ORT with Python 3.8 and Python 3.9, you can use ORT 1.19.2 and earlier.</li>\n<li><strong>ONNX Runtime 1.20 CUDA packages will include new dependencies that were not required in 1.19 packages.</strong> The following dependencies are new: libcudnn_adv.so.9, libcudnn_cnn.so.9, libcudnn_engines_precompiled.so.9, libcudnn_engines_runtime_compiled.so.9, libcudnn_graph.so.9, libcudnn_heuristic.so.9, libcudnn_ops.so.9, libnvrtc.so.12, and libz.so.1.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Build System &amp; Packages</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Python 3.13 support is included in PyPI packages.</li>\n<li>ONNX 1.17 support will be delayed until a future release, but the ONNX version used by ONNX Runtime has been patched to include a <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/onnx/onnx/pull/6010\">shape inference change to the Einsum op</a>.</li>\n<li>DLLs in the Maven build are now digitally signed (fix for issue reported <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/issues/19204\">here</a>).</li>\n<li>(Experimental) vcpkg support added for the CPU EP.

Approach</h2>\n<p><strong>Version 2.0.0</strong> removes the terminally deprecated <code>SecurityManager</code> approach and now uses a Java Agent to rewrite bytecode as the JVM loads classes. Whenever a call to <code>System.exit()</code> is detected, the JUnit 5 System Exit Agent replaces that call with a function that records an attempt to exit, preventing the JVM from exiting. As a consequence of rewriting bytecode, this library now has one dependency - <a href=\"https://asm.ow2.io/\">ASM</a>.</p>\n<p>Please see the <a href=\"https://github.com/tginsberg/junit5-system-exit/blob/b782d388278164f531333ceb2874c84d9122fdeb/README.md\">Project README</a> for comprehensive install instructions.</p>\n<h3>ChangeLog</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Remove terminally deprecated <code>SecurityManager</code> approach for preventing <code>System.exit()</code> calls</li>\n<li>Add Java Agent-based approach. Calls to <code>System.exit()</code> are rewritten as classes are loaded</li>\n<li>Add AssertJ-style fluid assertions for cases when test authors do not want to use annotations, or want to write assertions after a <code>System.exit()</code> is detected</li>\n<li>Upgrade Gradle to 8.10</li>\n<li>Upgrade JUnit to 5.11.0</li>\n<li>Switch to Kotlin DSL from Groovy DSL in Gradle build</li>\n<li>Switch to GitHub Actions for build runner</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Changelog</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/tginsberg/junit5-system-exit/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md\">com.ginsberg:junit5-system-exit's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3>2.0.0</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Remove terminally deprecated <code>SecurityManager</code> approach for preventing <code>System.exit()</code> calls.</li>\n<li>Add Java Agent-based approach.
