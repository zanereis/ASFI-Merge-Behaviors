PR adds a dialog to preview and estimate rollup of a datasource under the datasources section. The top 20 rows of the datasource will be previewed.

changing the granularity\r\n\r\nIf the ingested data was previously rolled up, the original rollup ratio will also be displayed.

#8710.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis PR modifies `CliIndexer` to announce itself as a `dataNodeService` in addition to `lookupNodeService` and `workerNodeService`, so that it functions correctly with `druid.serverview.type=http`. This involved both adding the service class to the `DiscoverySideEffectsProvider` announcer binding, as well as adding a dummy `null` provider for `SegmentLoadDropHandler` to make `SegmentListerResource` (which actually provides the segment \"announcement\" functionality in http inventory management) happy instead of explodey.\r\n\r\nMiddleManager nodes do not have this problem because tasks that are not running on an Indexer [perform this announcement themselves](https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/blob/master/indexing-service/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/indexing/seekablestream/SeekableStreamIndexTaskRunner.java#L394), since it is per task. Indexers rightfully suppress this per task announcement which would be super redundant, but were lacking this part of the announcement happening anywhere at an outer level.\r\n\r\nI could not determine good way to add automated tests for this at this time. I believe integration tests would probably be the most appropriate way, but adding additional containers does not seem like the correct or a scalable approach. Ideally I think the integration tests would probably run in some sort of configuration matrix so we could try out the variations to make sure everything is cool, but we also maybe have too much variation to make this worth the time. \r\n\r\nIn this specific case, maybe continuing to push to phase out reliance on Zookeeper would result in test coverage, assuming this configuration became the default, though I think we still have a lot of qualification to do before that change can be made.\r\n\r\nI did at least ensure things worked correctly on a tiny laptop cluster once the fix was in place.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid

find workers for them.\r\n\r\nHRTR is an experimental task runner. RTR based on zookeeper doesn't have this problem.\r\n\r\nAdditionally added few more endpoints to `HttpRemoteTaskRunnerResource` to introspect state of `HttpRemoteTaskRunner` for

a testing and troubleshooting framework to the console.\r\n\r\nThe Druid Doctor is a dialog that runs a series of tests that test the capabilities of a cluster via the HTTP APIs available via the router node. The aim is to be able to identify common cluster and data misconfigurations and present helpful suggestions to the user.\r\n\r\nThere are currently 9 tests:\r\n\r\n- Verify own status\r\n- Verify own runtime properties\r\n- Verify the Coordinator and Overlord status\r\n- Verify the Coordinator and Overlord runtime properties\r\n- Verify that the sampler works\r\n- Verify that SQL works\r\n- Verify that there are historical nodes\r\n- Verify that the historicals are not overfilled\r\n- Look for time chunks that could benefit from compaction\r\n\r\nIn the future I would also like to add a test

PR adjusts certain aspects of the Kinesis resharding fixes introduced in #8644:\r\n- #8644 changed the shardID -> partition group mapping to use hashing, to provide a fixed mapping. However, when shards can expire, this can result in imbalanced distribution of active shards among tasks (e.g., some tasks may not get any readable shards). This PR reverts the mapping logic back to using the position of the shard within the shard list % task count, restricting the shard list to only non-expired shards. To handle expired shards, this PR instead recomputes the partition group mappings when shards expire, and tells any active tasks created under the old mappings to exit early.\r\n- Instead of deleting expired shards from metadata, this PR changes the expiration handling to store an \"EXPIRED\" sequence number marker instead. While expired shards should never reappear, keeping a record of expired shards in metadata will allow us to better handle such anomalies.\r\n- Adjusts `checkSequenceNumberAvailability` (renamed to `checkOffsetAvailability`), only the earliest available offset needs to be compared against the target offset. Because the \"LATEST\" Kinesis shard iterator only provides access to the seq no after the most recent record (and there is no mode to get the latest readable record), the \"get latest offset\" operation in Kinesis runs in a polling loop. When data is not being continuously written to a shard, this can result in a Kinesis supervisor making extremely slow progress as it waits for the polling loop to timeout for each shard that has no recent data. Removing the latest offset check restricts this problem situation to only when a Kinesis supervisor first discovers a shard that's empty (after data is written to that shard once, the earliest seq no check can return immediately)\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-15T01:22:19Z","updated_at":"2019-12-17T23:53:50Z","closed_at":"2019-10-16T06:19:18Z","merged_at":"2019-10-16T06:19:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"89ce6384f57cb13c776cfcc9fc7b97126b834fac","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":690563043,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTA1NjMwNDM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Streaming%20Ingestion","name":"Area

PR adds the following jars back to druid-hdfs-storage (pruned in #8230) due to observing issues with hadoop ingestion when they're missing:\r\n\r\n```\r\njackson-jaxrs-1.9.13.jar\r\njackson-xc-1.9.13.jar\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt also adds an explicit dependency on `jackson-core-asl-1.9.13` to `indexing-hadoop`, this is currently being brought in through the Curator 4.1.0 dependency, but it's needed when using Hadoop/HDFS. Later versions of Curator such as 4.2.0 no longer bring in this dependency, so we shouldn't rely on Curator for that.\r\n\r\n```\r\n2019-10-08T21:04:19,977 WARN [main]

#8559.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAllow Druid to fetch credentials from within an ECS container on AWS.\r\n\r\nI added an instance of `EC2ContainerCredentialsProviderWrapper` which seems to be the fully baked way to get credentials on ECS with the SDK. I first tried adding `new ContainerCredentialsProvider()` but saw that constructor was deprecated. Despite `EC2` in the name, I believe this should work for ECS Fargate as well. I noticed [a similar change in the Hadoop project](https://github.com/apache/hadoop/pull/413).\r\n\r\nI also noticed that the line below (`new InstanceProfileCredentialsProvider()`) was showing a deprecation warning in my editor. [The docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/auth/InstanceProfileCredentialsProvider.html) say that this constructor had been deprecated in favor of the `.getInstance` method on the same class.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] ~added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths~.\r\n- [ ] ~added integration tests~.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n\r\nI can test this change in a development Druid cluster. I noticed that there are no unit tests for this class, but unit tests don't seem like a good fit. I'd be happy to add onto any integration tests that I may have missed.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n *

PR makes several adjustments to areas related to Kinesis resharding:\r\n- The Kinesis supervisor now filters out closed shards before sending partition/sequence num mappings in task specs. Previously this would cause tasks to fail because the supervisor does not include closed shards in the setEndOffsets call.\r\n- When a shard expires, the supervisor will now remove the expired shard from metadata storage and the `partitionGroups`.\r\n- The logic for determining shard ID -> task group mappings is changed. Previously this was done with (index of shard ID in shard list % task count). This fluid mapping caused issues with the same shard being assigned to multiple task groups when expired shards were removed from the shard list. This now attempts to parse the shard number from the shard ID, instead of using the list position. If the parse attempt fails, the number % task count will be a hash of the shard ID instead.\r\n- (Unrelated to sharding) Fixes a bug in SeekableStreamIndexTaskRunner with the publishing sequences: When iterating through the list of sequences to publish, it was possible for the publish future to complete before the task was done iterating through the sequence list; this would cause sequences to be skipped, as the publish future removes items from the sequence list. This block now snapshots the sequence list before publishing them.\r\n- Adds shard split/merge test to Kinesis supervisor tests, adds end-of-shard handling test to Kinesis task test\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [x] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) \r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-08T06:15:22Z","updated_at":"2019-12-17T23:54:01Z","closed_at":"2019-10-10T07:16:45Z","merged_at":"2019-10-10T07:16:45Z","merge_commit_sha":"0c387c1d47a56b04c60b642958d7de9b625556c5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":690563043,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTA1NjMwNDM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Streaming%20Ingestion","name":"Area

Description\r\n\r\nWhen using single-dimension partitioning, use targetRowsPerSegment (if specified) to size segments.

Previously, it would create partitions up to 1 less than those limits. This change, makes the behavior consistent with the behavior of the row-count-based limits in DynamicPartitionsSpec. \r\n\r\nAlso, fix some IntelliJ inspection warnings in

#8606\r\n\r\nAdded gifs to the readme to showcase that Druid is user friendly and also to make the readme more visually interesting.

out:\r\n\r\n- I used a trick where the GIFs are in the GH CDN (via #8606) instead of being checked into the repo, this is because they are ~16MB in total and it would suck to have CI download them on every run.\r\n- I really do not want it to seem that the web console query view is the *only* way to query Druid - I tried to make that clear with the caption text after the GIF.\r\n- I changed the Slack invite link to the Apache official one.\r\n\r\nVery excited to have a cool

#8489.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nIn addition to #8489, `targetCompactionSizeBytes` is dropped for the compaction task and auto compaction. `targetCompactionSizeBytes` was added for easy configuration, but it could be a misleading that optimizing segments should be done in terms of the size rather than number of rows. Dropping `targetCompactionSizeBytes` also makes things simpler such that all tasks can share the same partitionsSpec since `targetCompactionSizeBytes` makes sense only for compaction task.\r\n`maxRowsPerSegment` now is a mandatory configuration for auto compaction. For compaction task, any partitionsSpec can be used.\r\n\r\nAlso fixed a bug that auto compaction couldn't compact an interval if there is only one segment. Note that compaction can split a segment into smaller ones.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nCurrently when the coordinator issues a compaction task in auto compaction, it specifies a list of segments to compact explicitly. The list of segments is used to validate the given segments are still the most recent segments in compaction task. \r\n\r\nThis could lead to a very large compaction task spec which could be larger than the max znode size of ZooKeeper. To avoid this problem, auto compaction supports a configuration of `maxNumSegmentsToCompact` which limits the number of segments to compact together at the same time. However, with this way, the auto compaction has a limitation that it cannot compact an interval if there are too many segments.\r\n\r\nThis PR is to avoid this issue by using a hash of segment IDs instead of the list of segments for validating input segments. The below changes are also included.\r\n\r\n#### New IOConfig for compaction task\r\n\r\nCompaction task now requires an ioConfig. You can set `inputSpec` in the ioConfig. An example ioConfig is:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n  \"ioConfig\" : {\r\n    \"type\": \"compact\",\r\n    \"inputSpec\": {\r\n      \"type\": \"interval\",\r\n      \"interval\": \"2017-01-01/2018-01-01\"\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are two types of `inputSpec`s, i.e., `interval` and `segments`, for now. \r\n\r\n```json\r\n    \"inputSpec\": {\r\n      \"type\": \"interval\",\r\n      \"interval\": \"2017-01-01/2018-01-01\"\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n```json\r\n    \"inputSpec\": {\r\n      \"type\": \"segments\",\r\n      \"segments\": [\"segmentId1\", \"segmentId2\", ...]\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Using interval inputSpec for auto compaction\r\n\r\nAuto compaction used to specify all segments to compact explicitly in the compaction task spec. Now it always uses the `interval` inputSpec instead. `maxNumSegmentsToCompact` was dropped as well.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.","created_at":"2019-09-23T07:02:29Z","updated_at":"2019-10-09T18:12:01Z","closed_at":"2019-10-09T18:12:01Z","merged_at":"2019-10-09T18:12:01Z","merge_commit_sha":"96d8523ecbc0108e622084671172fded81065aa0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":219582906,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODI5MDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Batch%20Ingestion","name":"Area

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR is to allow for auto compaction to use the parallel indexing task. This will be useful when there are too many or large segments in a single time chunk.\r\n\r\n#### New/changed configurations\r\n\r\n- Parallel indexing task has a new configuration, `splitHintSpec`, in the tuningConfig to allow for operators to give a hint to control the amount of data that each first phase sub task reads. `SegmentsSplitHintSpec` is the only available option for now which is used only for `IngestSegmentFirehose`.\r\n- Compaction task now uses `ParallelIndexTuningConfig`.\r\n- Auto compaction tuning config now supports `maxNumConcurrentSubTasks` and `splitHintSpec`.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\n\n<!-- Reviewable:start

PR updates Calcite to 1.21. \r\n\r\nUpgrading also fixes #8266 \r\n\r\nThis patch introduces incompatible behavior in two areas:\r\n- The Calcite optimizer can remove the ORDER BY from subqueries when there is no limit or offset (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-2798). An example in our unit tests is shown here: https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/pull/8566/files#diff-190f8eaf9dd09e8d7ae0564804286afcR808\r\n- The Calcite optimizer can make certain optimizations that assume SQL-compatible null handling behavior, e.g.:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/pull/8566/files#diff-190f8eaf9dd09e8d7ae0564804286afcR1830\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/pull/8566/files#diff-190f8eaf9dd09e8d7ae0564804286afcR1888\r\n\r\nThe web console relies on the subquery ORDER BY being respected (it can wrap queries made in the query view with an outer query that has a limit), so this patch adds an internal query context flag that wraps a query with a limit-only LogicalSort if specified.\r\n\r\nBefore including this version upgrade in a release, I think we should expose the SQL compatible null handling mode in our docs (https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/issues/4349) and update the web console to use the new context flag for applying limits.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths.\r\n","created_at":"2019-09-21T03:07:37Z","updated_at":"2020-01-09T01:15:41Z","closed_at":"2019-11-21T05:22:56Z","merged_at":"2019-11-21T05:22:56Z","merge_commit_sha":"dc6178d1f2332fe03e18576713ad517c87d4d031","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":283617667,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyODM2MTc2Njc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Incompatible","name":"Incompatible","color":"5319e7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":297508895,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyOTc1MDg4OTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Release%20Notes","name":"Release

Description\r\n\r\nIf neither the partition size nor the number of shards are specified,\r\ndefault to partitions of 5,000,000 rows (similar to the behavior of\r\ndynamic partitions). Previously, both could be null and cause incorrect\r\nbehavior. As a consequence, the default ingestion spec for hadoop\r\nnow correctly indicates that partitions need to be determined. \r\n\r\nSpecifying both a partition size and a number of shards now results in\r\nan error instead of ignoring the partition size in favor of using the\r\nnumber of shards. This is a behavior change that makes it more apparent\r\nto the user that only one of the two properties will be honored\r\n(previously, a message was just logged when the specified partition size\r\nwas ignored).\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the

PR that helps with failing tests in #7306.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\n### Semantic changes, API changes, corrections\r\n - The specification (and the names) of `IndexerMetadataStorageCoordinator.getUsedSegmentsForInterval()` and `getUsedSegmentsForIntervals()` methods used to say nothing about whether it returns only *visible* used segments in the specified interval(s) or *all* used segments. The implementation used to return only *visible* segments. I added `Segments visibility` parameter to these methods, where `Segments` is a enum with values `ONLY_VISIBLE` and `INCLUDING_OVERSHADOWED`, to force users of these methods to always make an explicit choice. I'm not sure all existing users of this API actually want only visible segments. These include:\r\n    - `MaterializedViewSupervisor`. FYI @sekingme, @zhangxinyu1 \r\n    - `HadoopIngestionSpec`. FYI @nishantmonu51 \r\n    - `ActionBasedUsedSegmentChecker`. FYI @jihoonson, @gianm \r\n    - `SegmentAllocateAction`. FYI @jihoonson, @gianm\r\n    - `CompactionTask`. FYI @jihoonson \r\n    - `MetadataResource`: this is the place where I've changed the former behavior: `/datasources/{dataSourceName}/segments` endpoint now returns all used segments (including overshadowed) on the specified intervals, rather than only visible ones. **This is a potentially `Incompatible` change, so it warrans `Design Review` and a mention in `Release Notes`.**\r\n - `getUsedSegmentsForInterval()` and `getUsedSegmentsForIntervals()` now also return a `Collection` instead of a `List` to emphasize that the order of the returned segments is unspecified (and also to avoid some unnecesssary copying between collections in the implementation).\r\n - Renamed `UsedSegmentsLister` to `UsedSegmentsRetriever`. The immediate reason for this rename is that this command doesn't return a `List` anymore (now it returns a `Collection`). The new name also makes more apparent the cost of this operation (an RPC call). Also, added `Segments visibility` parameter to this command to reflect the changes in `IndexerMetadataStorageCoordinator`'s API. Note: `UsedSegmentsLister` is not Druid's public or extension API.\r\n - Renamed `SegmentListUsedAction` to `RetrieveUsedSegmentsAction` and `SegmentListUnusedAction` to `RetrieveUnusedSegmentsAction`. Also, added `Segments visibility` parameter to the first action. The JSON serialization names of the commands are not changed, for backward compatibility: it's still \"segmentListUsed\" and \"segmentListUnused\", respectively. Even after [updating Druid to Jackson 2.9](https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/issues/7701), these names may not be changed as with property names (see https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/issues/7152), because these names are specified via a different beast: `JsonSubTypes.Type`. The addition of `Segments visibility` parameter (including to the JSON serialization form) should be backward- and forward-compatible in Jackson. When absent, the parameter defaults to `ONLY_VISIBLE` (the former behavior).\r\n - `MetadataSegmentManager.retrieveAllDataSourceNames()` now returns a `Set` instead of a `Collection`.\r\n\r\n#### Fixes in tests\r\n\r\nA lot of changes primarily in `KafkaIndexTaskTest` and `KinesisIndexTaskTest` which relied on a specific order of results returned from `IndexerMetadataStorageCoordinator.getUsedSegmentsForInterval()` which was unspecified and changed in this PR.\r\n\r\n### Refactorings and new utility methods\r\n - Added `JacksonUtils.readValue()` to reduce boilerplate with catching `IOException` and wrapping it into a `RuntimeException`.\r\n - Added `VersionedIntervalTimeline.findNonOvershadowedObjectsInInterval()` which before appeared in multiple places in the codebase ad-hoc. This change also fixes locking duplicating segments in `AbstractBatchIndexTask`, which could have been a bug, or benign unnecessary behavior. FYI @jihoonson. (This is the reason why this PR is labeled `Bug`.)\r\n\r\n#### Refactoring of tests\r\n\r\n - Extracted class abstract class `SeekableStreamIndexTaskTestBase` to reduce duplication between `KafkaIndexTaskTest` and `KinesisIndexTaskTest`. Note that this contradicts the advice to favor composition and \"Fixture\" classes over inheritance in tests which I brought up [a few days ago in the mailing list](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/43614ff13f320bbf8825a9ada4d07a031bf60ccef752d23dd72fac69@%3Cdev.druid.apache.org%3E). This is because with the current Druid's policy to *not* use static imports, usage of static methods would be way too mouthful. There may be a way to refactor these tests in object terms to create composable *object* fixtures. That would be better than inheritance, but I didn't explore this because this work would be too far outside of the scope of the PR. Anyway, I think at least reducing duplication via a common base class is a step in the right direction, both compared to not doing anything and leaving the duplicated code as is, and as an intermediate step towards object composition refactoring, if somebody endeavors to do it in the future.\r\n - Extracted `VersionedIntervalTimelineSpecificDataTest` from `VersionedIntervalTimelineTest`. Half of the methods in former `VersionedIntervalTimelineTest` required a different `setUp()` than the other half. I've split these halves between separate classes to avoid confusion. However, I've also added a common base class `VersionedIntervalTimelineTestBase` for them to avoid duplication. In this case, just allowing static imports from one class to another would make this unnecessary. I'll write about this in the mailing list.\r\n\r\n### Optimization\r\n - Don't create an intermediate `List` in `PartitionHolder.iterator()`, `spliterator()`, and `stream()` methods. See changes in `PartitionHolder` and `OvershadowableManager` classes.\r\n - Don't copy data into an intermediate `List` in the implementation of `NewestSegmentFirstIterator` and unnecessary sort in `findSegmentsToCompact()`.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n","created_at":"2019-09-20T14:41:10Z","updated_at":"2019-11-07T08:41:18Z","closed_at":"2019-11-06T19:07:05Z","merged_at":"2019-11-06T19:07:05Z","merge_commit_sha":"5c0fc0a13ab4d259b430bf50b322f631504c4529","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":283617667,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyODM2MTc2Njc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Incompatible","name":"Incompatible","color":"5319e7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":297508895,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyOTc1MDg4OTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Release%20Notes","name":"Release

#8460\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nDisables emitting of cache metrics by default and makes them optional. After this patch users would need to add `\"org.apache.druid.client.cache.CacheMonitor\"` to `druid.monitoring.monitors` property like others . It is already documented.\r\n\r\nCache is disabled by default as `druid.realtime.cache.useCache` and `druid.realtime.cache.populateCache` are both set to `false` and so should be cache metrics.\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [X] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n### Release Notes\r\nUsers, who would like Druid to report cache

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a timeout to the future.get method call in used with `JsonParserIterator.init` if `DirectDruidClient.QUERY_FAIL_TIME` is set on the query context of the query, to plug up a potential hole which would allow the broker to overshoot query timeout. \r\n\r\nUsing `DirectDruidClient.QUERY_FAIL_TIME` does mean that (as far as I can tell) this currently only works with the `JsonParserIterator` used by `DirectDruidClient`, since otherwise we would need to pass in request start time in order to set the correct timeout of the remaining timeout on the future. `MetadataSegmentView` and `SystemSchema` do not seem to have direct access to any sort of timeout or cancellation due to timeout facilities, so it didn't seem worth the effort to directly use the timeout on the query context.\r\n\r\nThis is currently using `System.currentTimeMillis()` despite #8505 in order to be consistent with `DirectDruidClient.checkQueryTimeout` which also uses `System.currentTimeMillis()`, in favor of addressing this in future work that fixes this up everywhere.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code

#7007\r\nProposal issue #8463\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a `sys.supervisors` table to the pool of system tables. This would allow to query the supervisors via DruidSQL.\r\n\r\n#### SupervisorResource changes\r\n- Added new queryParam `fullStatus` to `GET /druid/indexer/v1/supervisor`\r\n- Return a `List<SupervisorStatus>` instead of `Map<String,Object>` from `specGetAll`\r\n- Added class SupervisorStatus\r\n\r\n####  `SystemSchema` changes\r\n- Added `SupervisorTable` class to `SystemSchema` to contain supervisor specific code\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2019-09-16T23:57:11Z","updated_at":"2019-12-18T03:31:05Z","closed_at":"2019-10-18T22:16:43Z","merged_at":"2019-10-18T22:16:42Z","merge_commit_sha":"98f59ddd7e0dd44960f499f2384392be1e60eef0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":297508895,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyOTc1MDg4OTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Release%20Notes","name":"Release
