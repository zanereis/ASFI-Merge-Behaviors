What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWe introduce the SQLConf `spark.sql.legacy.avro.allowReadingWithIncompatibleSchema` to prevent reading interval types as date or timestamp types to avoid getting corrupt dates as well as reading decimal types with incorrect precision.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe found the following issues with open source Avro:\r\n\r\n- Interval types can be read as date or timestamp types that would lead to wildly different results\r\n   For example, `Duration.ofDays(1).plusSeconds(1)` will be read as `1972-09-27`, which is weird.\r\n- Decimal types can be read with lower precision, that leads to data being read as `null` instead of suggesting that a wider decimal format should be provided\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR

If it is null, an empty array of `StackTraceElements`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFix a case which prevents the history server from identifying failed jobs if the stacktrace was not set.\r\n\r\nExample eventlog\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n   \"Event\":\"SparkListenerJobEnd\",\r\n   \"Job ID\":31,\r\n   \"Completion Time\":1616171909785,\r\n   \"Job Result\":{\r\n      \"Result\":\"JobFailed\",\r\n      \"Exception\":{\r\n         \"Message\":\"Job aborted\"\r\n      }\r\n   }\r\n} \r\n```\r\n\r\n**Original behavior:**\r\n\r\nThe job is marked as `incomplete`\r\n\r\nError from the SHS logs:\r\n\r\n```\r\n23/05/01 21:57:16 INFO FsHistoryProvider: Parsing file:/tmp/nds_q86_fail_test to re-build UI...\r\n23/05/01 21:57:17 ERROR ReplayListenerBus:

There are two issues:\r\n- `ReuseAdaptiveSubquery` can not support reuse subquery if two subquery have the same exprId\r\n-  `InMemoryTableScan` miss apply `ReuseAdaptiveSubquery` when wrap `TableCacheQueryStageExec`\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```\r\nSeq(1).toDF(\"c1\").cache().createOrReplaceTempView(\"t1\")\r\nSeq(2).toDF(\"c2\").createOrReplaceTempView(\"t2\")\r\nspark.sql(\"SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE c1 < (SELECT c2 FROM t2)\")\r\n```\r\nThere are two `subquery#27` but have no `ReusedSubquery` \r\n\r\n```\r\nAdaptiveSparkPlan isFinalPlan=true\r\n+- == Final Plan ==\r\n   *(1) Filter (c1#14 < Subquery subquery#27, [id=#20])\r\n   :  +- Subquery subquery#27, [id=#20]\r\n   :     +- AdaptiveSparkPlan isFinalPlan=true\r\n   :        +- LocalTableScan [c2#25]\r\n   +- TableCacheQueryStage 0\r\n      +- InMemoryTableScan [c1#14], [(c1#14 < Subquery subquery#27, [id=#20])]\r\n            :- InMemoryRelation [c1#14], StorageLevel(disk, memory, deserialized, 1 replicas)\r\n            :     +- LocalTableScan [c1#14]\r\n            +- Subquery subquery#27, [id=#20]\r\n               +- AdaptiveSparkPlan isFinalPlan=true\r\n                  +- LocalTableScan [c2#25]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nImprove the coverage of reuse subquery.\r\n\r\nNote that, it is not a real perf issue because the subquery has been already reused (the same Java object). This pr just makes the plan clearer about subquery reuse.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIn this change we determine whether unresolved identifier is multipart or not and remap list of suggested columns to fit the same pattern.\r\n\r\n- Main change is in `StringUtils.scala`. The rest is caused by method rename and test fixes.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWhen determining a list of suggested columns/attributes for `UNRESOLVED_COLUMN.WITH_SUGGESTION` we sort by Levenshtein distance between unresolved identifier and list of fully qualified column names from target table. In case of a single-part identifier this might lead to poor experience especially for short(ish) identifiers, e.g. `a` and table with columns `m` and `aa` in default spark catalog => suggested list will be (`spark_catalog.default.m`, `spark_catalog.default.aa`) \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo, since we don't document internals of how we generate suggestion list for this error.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nExisting

But not very sure if that's a breaking change\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nBug fix\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nManually tested.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis pull request is to add a small Spark Connect Go client example and prototype.\r\n\r\nJIRA: https://issues.apache.org/jira/plugins/servlet/mobile#issue/SPARK-43351\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSpark Connect was released in Spark 3.4.0. There is no Go client yet. Better to have a Go client so Spark Connect could be used by Go programmer.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. User will be able to use Go to write Spark Connect application. A very simple example in Go looks like following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunc main() {\r\n\tremote := \"localhost:15002\"\r\n\tspark, _ := sql.SparkSession.Builder.Remote(remote).Build()\r\n\tdefer spark.Stop()\r\n\r\n\tdf, _ := spark.Sql(\"select 'apple' as word, 123 as count union all select 'orange' as word, 456 as count\")\r\n\tdf.Show(100, false)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee [README](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/b0207feed2d898617103057ac47c42d88f261236/connector/connect/client/go/README.md) for more details.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested by running the example Go

there, I noticed this project is referencing older Remote Plugins. There are upcoming [Remote Plugin changes](https://buf.build/blog/remote-packages-remote-plugins-approaching-v1) and this PR fixes the references to avoid any issues.\r\n\r\nOlder plugins on [buf.build](https://buf.build) will be removed in favor of Buf-managed plugins, which are managed by @bufbuild to ensure they work[^1] for the entire community.\r\n\r\nIn summary, the changes in this PR are as follows:\r\n\r\n- Update older plugins to reference the new plugins in `connector/connect/common/src/main/buf.gen.yaml`\r\n- Run `./dev/connect-gen-protos.sh` to generate the files\r\n\r\n[^1]: Buf has an open-source [bufbuild/plugins](https://github.com/bufbuild/plugins) repository that builds, tests, patches and automates publishing popular Protobuf plugins.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nInline `DepsTestsSuite#setPythonSparkConfProperties`, which was introduced in SPARK-27936.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe `setPythonSparkConfProperties` is only invoked in one place, doesn't look helping the readability much. Besides, it should use `conf` instead of `sparkAppConf`\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo. Since the caller always passes the `sparkAppConf`, this bug affects nothing actually.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nPass GA.","created_at":"2023-05-03T04:42:47Z","updated_at":"2023-05-03T16:06:01Z","closed_at":"2023-05-03T16:06:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"20545d3a50528c5870720618f29f0a3cfb322ce1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605057,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/KUBERNETES","name":"KUBERNETES","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41030/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41030/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/41030/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4596352326239f5708232e3f20a8304521626c52","head":{"label":"pan3793:SPARK-43352","ref":"SPARK-43352","sha":"4596352326239f5708232e3f20a8304521626c52","user":{"login":"pan3793","id":26535726,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTM1NzI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26535726?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793","html_url":"https://github.com/pan3793","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":275650396,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzU2NTAzOTY=","name":"spark","full_name":"pan3793/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"pan3793","id":26535726,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTM1NzI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26535726?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793","html_url":"https://github.com/pan3793","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/pan3793/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims two goals.\r\n1. Make PySpark support Python 3.8+ with PyPy3\r\n2. Upgrade PyPy3 to Python 3.8 in our GitHub Action Infra Image to enable test coverage\r\n\r\nNote that there was one failure at `test_create_dataframe_from_pandas_with_day_time_interval` test case.

needed?\r\nIt is to fix following bug.\r\n\r\nFor example, If a directory contains a following file:\r\n/path/abc[123]\r\nand users would load spark.readStream.format(\"text\").load(\"/path\") as stream input. It throws an exception, saying no matching path /path/abc[123]. Spark thinks abc[123] is a regex that only matches file named abc1, abc2 and abc3.\r\n\r\nThe bug is due to a second glob pattern match within DataSource, against files already glob matched by FileStreamSource. This match turns real file name into file path match pattern. It is unexpected and we would like to disable it.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, except fixing the unexpected buggy behavior.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded unit test scenarios which failed before the fix.\r\n","created_at":"2023-05-02T22:20:35Z","updated_at":"2023-05-09T03:55:39Z","closed_at":"2023-05-09T03:55:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1e5bb2da96dda5e93589908ab1ab430c78d5a762","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a follow-up PR to #40615.\r\n\r\nIn this PR we make sure that all sketches produces by the new expressions `hll_sketch_agg`, `hll_union_agg`, and `hll_union` are actually HLL DataSketches represented with 8-bit registers.\r\n\r\nUsing 8-bit registers improves the performance of the expressions at the expense of using more memory (the current implementation uses 4-bit registers by default, which is the default choice in the DataSketches library).\r\n\r\nNote that the register size of the DataSketches HLL sketch does not have any impact on the accuracy of the sketch.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo improve the performance of the new HLL-related expressions.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo in terms of SQL surface. However, the results of the `hll_sketch_agg`, `hll_union_agg`, and `hll_union` expressions can be different since we are changing the sketch representation. However, since these expressions have not been released yet we are not facing any breaking changes.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests

When we calculate the quantile information from the peak executor metrics values for the distribution, there is a possibility of running into an `ArrayIndexOutOfBounds` exception when the metric

This PR addresses that and fixes it by returning an empty array if the values are empty.\r\n\r\n ### Why are the changes needed?\r\n Without these changes, when the withDetails query parameter is used to query the stages REST API, we encounter a partial JSON response since the peak executor metrics distribution cannot be serialized due to the above index error.\r\n\r\n ### Does this PR introduce

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhen converting a StructType instance containing a nested StructType column which in turn contains a column for which `nullable = false` to a DDL string using `.toDDL`, the resulting DDL string does not include this non-nullability. For example:\r\n```\r\nval testSchema = StructType(List(\r\n  StructField(\"key\", IntegerType, false),\r\n  StructField(\"value\", StringType, true),\r\n  StructField(\"nestedCols\", StructType(List(\r\n    StructField(\"nestedKey\", IntegerType, false),\r\n    StructField(\"nestedValue\", StringType, true)\r\n  )), false)\r\n))\r\n\r\nprintln(testSchema.toDDL)\r\nprintln(StructType.fromDDL(testschema.toDDL))\r\n```\r\ngives\r\n```\r\nkey INT NOT NULL,value STRING,nestedCols STRUCT<nestedKey: INT, nestedValue: STRING> NOT NULL\r\n\r\nStructType(\r\n  StructField(key,IntegerType,false),\r\n  StructField(value,StringType,true),\r\n  StructField(nestedCols,StructType(\r\n    StructField(nestedKey,IntegerType,true),\r\n    StructField(nestedValue,StringType,true)\r\n  ),false)\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is due to the fact that `StructType.toDDL` calls `StructField.toDDL` for its fields, which in turn calls `.sql` for its `dataType`. If `dataType` is a StructType, the call to `.sql` in turn calls `.sql` for all the nested fields, and this last method does not include the nullability of the field in its output. The proposed solution is therefore to have `StructField.toDDL` call `dataType.toDDL` for a StructType, since this will include information about nullability of nested columns.\r\n\r\nTo work around the different DDL formats of nested and non-nested structs (the former is wrapped in `\"STRUCT ...>\"` and uses `colName: dataType` for its fields instead of `colName dataType`), package-private nested-specific versions of `.toDDL` have been added for StructType and StructField.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, converting a StructType schema to a DDL string does not pass information about nullability of nested columns. This leads to a loss of information, and means converting to DDL and then back could alter the StructType schema. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, given the example above, the output will become:\r\n```\r\nkey INT NOT NULL,value STRING,nestedCols STRUCT<nestedKey: INT NOT NULL, nestedValue: STRING> NOT NULL\r\n\r\nStructType(\r\n  StructField(key,IntegerType,false),\r\n  StructField(value,StringType,true),\r\n  StructField(nestedCols,StructType(\r\n    StructField(nestedKey,IntegerType,false),\r\n    StructField(nestedValue,StringType,true)\r\n  ),false)\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nIn `StructTypeSuite`, the `nestedStruct` testing value has been modified to include a non-nullable nested column. The relevant unit tests have been changed accordingly.","created_at":"2023-05-02T15:31:06Z","updated_at":"2024-01-18T14:28:53Z","closed_at":"2024-01-18T14:28:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cc4006d41044523b6d3f92b93df8f9bb81744401","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406625202,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI1MjAy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/MESOS","name":"MESOS","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41016/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/41016/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/41016/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/52a6a154d9dba11a38fd526ba9cc35a9ead961e2","head":{"label":"BramBoog:spark-43341-DDL-non-nullable-nested-column","ref":"spark-43341-DDL-non-nullable-nested-column","sha":"52a6a154d9dba11a38fd526ba9cc35a9ead961e2","user":{"login":"BramBoog","id":93602108,"node_id":"U_kgDOBZRBPA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/93602108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BramBoog","html_url":"https://github.com/BramBoog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BramBoog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BramBoog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BramBoog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BramBoog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BramBoog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BramBoog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BramBoog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BramBoog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BramBoog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":634953911,"node_id":"R_kgDOJdigtw","name":"spark","full_name":"BramBoog/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"BramBoog","id":93602108,"node_id":"U_kgDOBZRBPA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/93602108?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BramBoog","html_url":"https://github.com/BramBoog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BramBoog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BramBoog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BramBoog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BramBoog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BramBoog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BramBoog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BramBoog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BramBoog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BramBoog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/BramBoog/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nCasting between Timestamp and TimestampNTZ requires a timezone since the timezone id is used in the evaluation.\r\nThis PR updates the method `Cast.needsTimeZone` to include the conversion between Timestamp and TimestampNTZ. As a result:\r\n* Casting between Timestamp and TimestampNTZ is considered as unresolved unless the timezone is defined\r\n* Canonicalizing cast will include the time zone\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTimezone id is used in the evaluation between Timestamp and TimestampNTZ, thus we should mark such conversion as \"needsTimeZone\"\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo. It is more like a fix for potential bugs that the casting between Timestamp and TimestampNTZ is marked as resolved before resolving the timezone.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nNew

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWe want to allow the parameterization of identifiers in SQL statements without compromising security.\r\nRight now this can only be done using ${..} variable substitution which allows for arbitrary text substitution.\r\nThe improvement proposed here is to use an IDENTIFIER() clause which produces a possibly qualified identifier based on a foldable STRING constant. That way we can use BIND PARAMETERS to safely badd (qualified) table, column and function identifiers.\r\n\r\nThis PR represent:\r\n\r\n- Support for column, table, and function references in queries and DML statements\r\n- Support for table and view subjects of DDL, and utility statements such as SHOW and DESCRIBE\r\n- Support for namespace: CREATE/DROP/ALTER, USE (but not USE NAMESPACE)/SHOW/DESCRIBE\r\n- Support for function: CREATE/DROP/ALTER,  SHOW and DESCRIBE\r\n\r\nWhat is missing:\r\n\r\n- unblock support for bind parameters in DDL to support: CREATE TABLE IDENTIFIER(:tabname) (c1 INT);\r\n- TEMPORARY FUNCTIONS. Debatable whether that is needed\r\n- Column definitions in table DDL. This MAY be interesting\r\n- qualifier of * (IDENTIFIER().*)\r\n \r\n**Example:**\r\nspark.sql(\"SELECT * FROM IDENTIFIER('S.' || :tabname\", args = Map(\"tabname\" -> \"myTab\");\r\n==>\r\nSELECT * FROM s.mytab;\r\n\r\nNote that the IDENTIFIER(<literal) syntax originates from Snowflake.\r\nThere is no other vendor I am aware of with similar capability.\r\n\r\n[Link to a more detailed specification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14BhSZFeDoK-iZa7-66PjlHQ4nYLpdePDWNSW3kkLZAs/edit?usp=sharing)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo protect scripts that substitute table or column names from SQL injection attacks.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, this is a new SQL feature.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew SQL tests have been

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, queries that are ran using Spark Connect cannot be interrupted. Even when the RPC connection got broken, the Spark jobs on the server continue running.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes a \r\n```\r\nrpc Interrupt(InterruptRequest) returns (InterruptResponse) {}\r\n```\r\nserver RPC API, that can be called from the client as `SparkSession.interruptAll()` to interrupt all actively running Spark Jobs from ExecutePlan executions. In most user scenarios, SparkSession is not used for multiple executions concurrently, but is used sequentially, so `interruptAll()` should serve a big chunk of user needs. It can also be used to clean up.\r\n\r\nTo keep track of executions, we introduce `ExecutionHolder` to hold the execution state, and make `SessionHolder` keep track of the executions currently running in the session. In this first PR, the interrupt only interrupts running Spark Jobs. As such, it is to a degree best effort, because it will not interrupt commands that don't run Spark Jobs, or it will not interrupt anything if a Spark Job is not running when it the interrupt is received by the server, and  the command will continue running and may continue launching more Spark jobs later in that case.\r\n\r\nFuture work I plan to design and work on will involve:\r\n* Interrupting any execution. This will involve moving execution from the GRPC handler thread handling ExecutePlan to launching it in a separate thread that can be interrupted. `ExecutionHolder`\r\n* Interrupting executions selectively. This will involve exposing the operationId to the user.\r\n* (Refactor) some cleanup needed around using SessionHolder. Currently, sessionId, userId, various session data is passed around separately. SessionHolder may be passed instead, and then also be extended with more useful APIs for management of the session.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nNeed to have APIs to be able to interrupt running queries in Spark Connect.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes.\r\nUsers of Spark Connect can now call `interruptAll()` on client `SparkSession` object, to send an interrupt RPC to the server, which will interrupt the running queries.\r\n\r\nIn followup PRs, this will be extended to Python client, and to work not only for interrupting Spark Jobs.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded E2E tests to ClientE2ETestSuite for scala connect client.\r\nAdded unit tests to test_client for python connect

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFixed minor issues & added a simple statement to ensure the program doesn't allow killing all executors. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe dynamic alloc config hangs when the minexec count is 0 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nIt does, but it does not affect the user in any way, just shows a warning message. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis was done on a test cluster. The cluster does run without problems but I feel there are additional safety methods we could add. I'm working on finding a way to calculate and run on an optimal number of clusters so this problem is not repeated.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTrigger `committer.setupJob` before plan execute in `FileFormatWriter#write`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIn this issue, the case where `outputOrdering` might not work if AQE is enabled has been resolved.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/38358\r\n\r\nHowever, since it materializes the AQE plan in advance (triggers getFinalPhysicalPlan) , it may cause the committer.setupJob(job) to not execute When `AdaptiveSparkPlanExec#getFinalPhysicalPlan()` is executed with an error.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nadd

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR updates column DEFAULT assignment to add missing values for MERGE INSERT actions. This brings the behavior to parity with non-MERGE INSERT commands.\r\n\r\n* It also adds a small convenience feature where if the provided default value is a literal of a wider type than the target column, but the literal value fits within the narrower type, just coerce it for convenience. For example, `CREATE TABLE t (col INT DEFAULT 42L)` returns an error before this PR because `42L` has a long integer type which is wider than `col`, but after this PR we just coerce it to `42` since the value fits within the short integer range.\r\n* We also add the `SupportsCustomSchemaWrite` interface which tables may implement to exclude certain pseudocolumns from consideration when resolving column DEFAULT values.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThese changes make column DEFAULT values more usable in more types of situations.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, see above.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds new unit test

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdd a new rule in `queryStagePreparationRules`. If there have adjacent aggregation with Partial and Final mode, we can combine them to Complete mode, so that we do not need to merge aggregation buffer.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```\r\nHashAggregate (Final)         HashAggregate (Complete)\r\n       |                             |\r\nHashAggregate (Partial)    =>    Exchange\r\n       |\r\n   Exchange\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nImprove performance. According to the benchmark result, it has more benefits with high cardinality case.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nadd test\r\n\r\n```\r\nOpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM 1.8.0_362-b09 on Linux 5.15.0-1036-azure\r\nIntel(R) Xeon(R)

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdds a config for pandas conversion how to handle struct types.\r\n\r\n- `spark.sql.execution.pandas.structHandlingMode` (default: `\"legacy\"`)\r\n\r\nThe conversion mode of struct type when creating pandas DataFrame.\r\n\r\n#### When `\"legacy\"`, the behavior is the same as before, except that with Arrow and Spark Connect will raise a more readable exception when there are duplicated nested field names.\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> spark.sql(\"values (1, struct(1 as a, 2 as a)) as t(x, y)\").toPandas()\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n...\r\npyspark.errors.exceptions.connect.UnsupportedOperationException: [DUPLICATED_FIELD_NAME_IN_ARROW_STRUCT] Duplicated field names in Arrow Struct are not allowed, got [a, a].\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### When `\"row\"`, convert to Row object regardless of Arrow optimization.\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> spark.conf.set('spark.sql.execution.pandas.structHandlingMode', 'row')\r\n>>> spark.conf.set('spark.sql.execution.arrow.pyspark.enabled', False)\r\n>>> spark.sql(\"values (1, struct(1 as a, 2 as b)) as t(x, y)\").toPandas()\r\n   x       y\r\n0  1  (1, 2)\r\n>>> spark.sql(\"values (1, struct(1 as a, 2 as a)) as t(x, y)\").toPandas()\r\n   x       y\r\n0  1  (1, 2)\r\n>>> spark.conf.set('spark.sql.execution.arrow.pyspark.enabled', True)\r\n>>> spark.sql(\"values (1, struct(1 as a, 2 as b)) as t(x, y)\").toPandas()\r\n   x       y\r\n0  1  (1, 2)\r\n>>> spark.sql(\"values (1, struct(1 as a, 2 as a)) as t(x, y)\").toPandas()\r\n   x       y\r\n0  1  (1, 2)\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### When `\"dict\"`, convert to dict and use suffixed key names, e.g., `a_0`, `a_1`, if there are duplicated nested field names, regardless of Arrow optimization.\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> spark.conf.set('spark.sql.execution.pandas.structHandlingMode', 'dict')\r\n>>> spark.conf.set('spark.sql.execution.arrow.pyspark.enabled', False)\r\n>>> spark.sql(\"values (1, struct(1 as a, 2 as b)) as t(x, y)\").toPandas()\r\n   x                 y\r\n0  1  {'a': 1, 'b': 2}\r\n>>> spark.sql(\"values (1, struct(1 as a, 2 as a)) as t(x, y)\").toPandas()\r\n   x                     y\r\n0  1  {'a_0': 1, 'a_1': 2}\r\n>>> spark.conf.set('spark.sql.execution.arrow.pyspark.enabled', True)\r\n>>> spark.sql(\"values (1, struct(1 as a, 2 as b)) as t(x, y)\").toPandas()\r\n   x                 y\r\n0  1  {'a': 1, 'b': 2}\r\n>>> spark.sql(\"values (1, struct(1 as a, 2 as a)) as t(x, y)\").toPandas()\r\n   x                     y\r\n0  1  {'a_0': 1, 'a_1': 2}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently there are three behaviors when `df.toPandas()` with nested struct types:\r\n\r\n- vanilla PySpark with Arrow optimization disabled\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> spark.conf.set('spark.sql.execution.arrow.pyspark.enabled', False)\r\n>>> spark.sql(\"values (1, struct(1 as a, 2 as b)) as t(x, y)\").toPandas()\r\n   x       y\r\n0  1  (1, 2)\r\n```\r\n\r\nusing `Row` object for struct types.\r\n\r\nIt can use duplicated field names.\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> spark.sql(\"values (1, struct(1 as a, 2 as a)) as t(x, y)\").toPandas()\r\n   x       y\r\n0  1  (1, 2)\r\n```\r\n\r\n- vanilla PySpark with Arrow optimization enabled\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> spark.conf.set('spark.sql.execution.arrow.pyspark.enabled', True)\r\n>>> spark.sql(\"values (1, struct(1 as a, 2 as b)) as t(x, y)\").toPandas()\r\n   x                 y\r\n0  1  {'a': 1, 'b': 2}\r\n```\r\n\r\nusing `dict` for struct types.\r\n\r\nIt raises an Exception when there are duplicated nested field names:\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> spark.sql(\"values (1, struct(1 as a, 2 as a)) as t(x, y)\").toPandas()\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n...\r\npyarrow.lib.ArrowInvalid: Ran out of field metadata, likely malformed\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Spark Connect\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> spark.sql(\"values (1, struct(1 as a, 2 as b)) as t(x, y)\").toPandas()\r\n   x                 y\r\n0  1  {'a': 1, 'b': 2}\r\n```\r\n\r\nusing `dict` for struct types.\r\n\r\nIf there are duplicated nested field names, the duplicated keys are

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis adds an option to convert Protobuf 'Any' fields to JSON. At runtime such 'Any' fields   \r\ncan contain arbitrary Protobuf message serialized as binary data.                            \r\n                                                                                             \r\nBy default when this option is not enabled, such field behaves like normal Protobuf message  \r\nwith two fields (`STRUCT<type_url: STRING, value: BINARY>`). The binary `value` field is not \r\ninterpreted. This might not be convenient in practice.                                       \r\n                                                                                             \r\nOne option is to deserialize it into actual Protobuf message and convert it to Spark STRUCT. \r\nBut this is not feasible since the schema for `from_protobuf()` is needed at query compile   \r\ntime and can not change at run time. As a result this is not feasible.                       \r\n                                                                                             \r\nAnother option is parse the binary and deserialize the Protobuf message into JSON string.    \r\nThis this lot more readable than the binary data. This configuration option enables          \r\nconverting Any fields to JSON. The example blow clarifies further.                            \r\n                                                                                             \r\n Consider two Protobuf types defined as follows:                                             \r\n```\r\n   message ProtoWithAny {                                                                    \r\n      string event_name = 1;                                                                 \r\n      google.protobuf.Any details = 2;                                                       \r\n   }                                                                                         \r\n                                                                                             \r\n   message Person {                                                                          \r\n     string name = 1;                                                                        \r\n     int32 id = 2;                                                                           \r\n  }                                                                                          \r\n```                                                                                             \r\nWith this option enabled, schema for `from_protobuf(\"col\", messageName = \"ProtoWithAny\")`    \r\nwould be : `STRUCT<event_name: STRING, details: STRING>`.                                    \r\nAt run time, if `details` field contains `Person` Protobuf message, the returned value looks \r\nlike the this:\r\n                                                    \r\n    ('click', '{\"@type\":\"type.googleapis.com/...ProtoWithAny\",\"name\":\"Mario\",\"id\":100}')       \r\n                                                                                             \r\nRequirements:                                                                                \r\n - The definitions for all the possible Protobuf types that are used in Any fields should be \r\n   available in the Protobuf descriptor file passed to `from_protobuf()`. If any Protobuf    \r\n   is not found, it will result in error for that record.                                    \r\n - This feature is supported with Java classes as well. But only the Protobuf types defined  \r\n   in the same `proto` file as the primary Java class might be visible.                      \r\n   E.g. if `ProtoWithAny` and `Person` in above example are in different proto files,        \r\n   definition for `Person` may not be found.                                                 \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nImproves handling of Any fields.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo. Default behavior is not changed\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCreate `NonFateSharingCache` to wrap around Guava cache with a KeyLock to synchronize all requests with the same key, so they will run individually and fail as if they come one at a time.\r\n\r\nWrap cache in `CodeGenerator` with `NonFateSharingCache` to protect it from unexpected cascade failure due to cancellation from irrelevant queries that loading the same key. Feel free to use this in other places where we used Guava cache and don't want fate-sharing behavior.\r\n\r\nAlso, instead of implementing Guava Cache and LoadingCache interface, I define a subset of it so that we can control at compile time what cache operations are allowed and make sure all cache loading action go through our narrow waist code path with key lock. Feel free to add new APIs when needed.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nGuava cache is widely used in spark, however, it suffers from fate-sharing behavior: If there are multiple requests trying to access the same key in the cache at the same time when the key is not in the cache, Guava cache will block all requests and create the object only once. If the creation fails, all requests will fail immediately without retry. So we might see task failure due to irrelevant failure in other queries due to fate sharing.\r\n\r\nThis fate sharing behavior leads to unexpected results in some situation(for example, in code gen).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUT\r\n","created_at":"2023-04-27T21:02:48Z","updated_at":"2023-06-19T00:07:24Z","closed_at":"2023-05-16T01:48:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5a0d0f656f0719e7610d829f27d123fdd2600b76","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40982/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40982/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/40982/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/309cd452c6cc23c869528fd3a72492a877ece841","head":{"label":"liuzqt:SPARK-43300","ref":"SPARK-43300","sha":"309cd452c6cc23c869528fd3a72492a877ece841","user":{"login":"liuzqt","id":22358241,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzU4MjQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22358241?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt","html_url":"https://github.com/liuzqt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":511387078,"node_id":"R_kgDOHnslxg","name":"spark","full_name":"liuzqt/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"liuzqt","id":22358241,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzU4MjQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22358241?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt","html_url":"https://github.com/liuzqt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/liuzqt/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd RocksDB state store memory management enhancements\r\n\r\nThis change does the following:\r\n\r\n- remove use of writeBatchWithIndex\r\n- move towards using Native RocksDB operations\r\n- remove use of RocksDB WAL\r\n- add support for bounding memory usage for all RocksDB state store instances on executor using the write buffer manager\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nToday when RocksDB is used as a State Store provider, memory usage when writing using writeBatch is not capped. Also, a related issue is that the state store coordinator can create multiple RocksDB instances on a single node without enforcing a global limit on native memory usage. Due to these issues we could run into OOM issues and task failures. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded unit tests and fixed existing ones\r\n\r\nRocksDBStateStoreSuite\r\n```\r\n[info] Run completed in 40 seconds, 916 milliseconds.\r\n[info] Total number of tests run: 33\r\n[info] Suites: completed 1, aborted

So we can skip unnecessary aggregate.\r\n\r\nOnly work when subquery without `group by` statement.\r\n\r\neg:\r\n```sql\r\ncreate or replace temp view l (a, b)\r\nas values\r\n    (1, 1.0),\r\n    (2, 2.0);\r\ncreate or replace temp view r (c, d)\r\nas values\r\n    (2, 3.0); \r\nselect a, (select (count(1)) is null from r where a = c) from l where a < 4\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe plan before this PR:\r\n```\r\n== Parsed Logical Plan ==\r\n'Project ['a, unresolvedalias(scalar-subquery#240 [], None)]\r\n:  +- 'Project [unresolvedalias(isnull('count(1)), None)]\r\n:     +- 'Filter ('a = 'c)\r\n:        +- 'UnresolvedRelation [r], [], false\r\n+- 'Filter ('a < 4)\r\n   +- 'UnresolvedRelation [l], [], false\r\n\r\n== Analyzed Logical Plan ==\r\na: int, scalarsubquery(a): boolean\r\nProject [a#225, scalar-subquery#240 [a#225] AS scalarsubquery(a)#243]\r\n:  +- Aggregate [isnull(count(1)) AS (count(1) IS NULL)#242]\r\n:     +- Filter (outer(a#225) = c#236)\r\n:        +- SubqueryAlias r\r\n:           +- View (`r`, [c#236,d#237])\r\n:              +- Project [_1#231 AS c#236, _2#232 AS d#237]\r\n:                 +- LocalRelation [_1#231, _2#232]\r\n+- Filter (a#225 < 4)\r\n   +- SubqueryAlias l\r\n      +- View (`l`, [a#225,b#226])\r\n         +- Project [_1#220 AS a#225, _2#221 AS b#226]\r\n            +- LocalRelation [_1#220, _2#221]\r\n\r\n== Optimized Logical Plan ==\r\nProject [_1#220 AS a#225, if (isnull(alwaysTrue#246)) false else (count(1) IS NULL)#242 AS scalarsubquery(a)#243]\r\n+- Join LeftOuter, (_1#220 = c#236)\r\n   :- Project [_1#220]\r\n   :  +- Filter (isnotnull(_1#220) AND (_1#220 < 4))\r\n   :     +- LocalRelation [_1#220, _2#221]\r\n   +- Aggregate [c#236], [false AS (count(1) IS NULL)#242, c#236, true AS alwaysTrue#246]\r\n      +- Project [_1#231 AS c#236]\r\n         +- Filter ((_1#231 < 4) AND isnotnull(_1#231))\r\n            +- LocalRelation [_1#231, _2#232]\r\n\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\nAdaptiveSparkPlan isFinalPlan=false\r\n+- Project [_1#220 AS a#225, if (isnull(alwaysTrue#246)) false else (count(1) IS NULL)#242 AS scalarsubquery(a)#243]\r\n   +- BroadcastHashJoin [_1#220], [c#236], LeftOuter, BuildRight, false\r\n      :- Project [_1#220]\r\n      :  +- Filter (isnotnull(_1#220) AND (_1#220 < 4))\r\n      :     +- LocalTableScan [_1#220, _2#221]\r\n      +- BroadcastExchange HashedRelationBroadcastMode(List(cast(input[1, int, true] as bigint)),false), [plan_id=120]\r\n         +- HashAggregate(keys=[c#236], functions=[], output=[(count(1) IS NULL)#242, c#236, alwaysTrue#246])\r\n            +- Exchange hashpartitioning(c#236, 5), ENSURE_REQUIREMENTS, [plan_id=117]\r\n               +- HashAggregate(keys=[c#236], functions=[], output=[c#236])\r\n                  +- Project [_1#231 AS c#236]\r\n                     +- Filter ((_1#231 < 4) AND isnotnull(_1#231))\r\n                        +- LocalTableScan [_1#231, _2#232]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe plan after this PR:\r\n```\r\n== Parsed Logical Plan ==\r\n'Project ['a, unresolvedalias(scalar-subquery#240 [], None)]\r\n:  +- 'Project [unresolvedalias(isnull('count(1)), None)]\r\n:     +- 'Filter ('a = 'c)\r\n:        +- 'UnresolvedRelation [r], [], false\r\n+- 'Filter ('a < 4)\r\n   +- 'UnresolvedRelation [l], [], false\r\n\r\n== Analyzed Logical Plan ==\r\na: int, scalarsubquery(a): boolean\r\nProject [a#225, scalar-subquery#240 [a#225] AS scalarsubquery(a)#243]\r\n:  +- Aggregate [isnull(count(1)) AS (count(1) IS NULL)#242]\r\n:     +- Filter (outer(a#225) = c#236)\r\n:        +- SubqueryAlias r\r\n:           +- View (`r`, [c#236,d#237])\r\n:              +- Project [_1#231 AS c#236, _2#232 AS d#237]\r\n:                 +- LocalRelation [_1#231, _2#232]\r\n+- Filter (a#225 < 4)\r\n   +- SubqueryAlias l\r\n      +- View (`l`, [a#225,b#226])\r\n         +- Project [_1#220 AS a#225, _2#221 AS b#226]\r\n            +- LocalRelation [_1#220, _2#221]\r\n\r\n== Optimized Logical Plan ==\r\nProject [_1#220 AS a#225, false AS scalarsubquery(a)#243]\r\n+- Filter (isnotnull(_1#220) AND (_1#220 < 4))\r\n   +- LocalRelation [_1#220, _2#221]\r\n\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\n*(1) Project [_1#220 AS a#225, false AS scalarsubquery(a)#243]\r\n+- *(1) Filter (isnotnull(_1#220) AND (_1#220 < 4))\r\n   +- *(1) LocalTableScan [_1#220, _2#221]\r\n```\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis change adds support for optional IV and AAD fields to ExpressionImplUtils, which is the underlying library to support `aes_encrypt` and `aes_decrypt`. This allows callers to specify their own initialization vector values for some specific use cases, and to take advantage of AES-GCM's authenticated additional data optional input.\r\n\r\nThis change does **not** add the support to the user-facing `aes_encrypt` and `aes_decrypt` yet. That will be added in a follow-up, rather than in a single complex change.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThere are some use cases where callers to ExpressionImplUtils via aes_encrypt may want to provide initialization vectors (IVs) or additional authenticated data (AAD). The most common cases will be:\r\n1. Ensuring that ciphertext matches values that have been encrypted by external tools. In those cases, the caller will need to provide an identical IV value.\r\n2. For AES-CBC mode, there are some cases where callers want to generate deterministic encrypted output.\r\n3. For AES-GCM mode, providing AAD fields allows callers to bind additional data to an encrypted ciphertext so that it can only be decrypted by a caller providing the same value. This is often used to enforce some context.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNot yet. This change adds support to the underlying implementation, but does not yet update the SQL support to include the new parameters.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAll existing unit tests still pass and new tests in `ExpressionImplUtilsSuite` exercise the new code paths:\r\n```\r\nbuild/sbt \"sql/test:testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrameFunctionsSuite\"\r\nbuild/sbt \"catalyst/test:testOnly

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe current implementation of AES-CBC mode called via `aes_encrypt` and `aes_decrypt` uses a key derivation function (KDF) based on OpenSSL's [EVP_BytesToKey](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man3.0/man3/EVP_BytesToKey.html). This is intended for generating keys based on passwords and OpenSSL's documents discourage its use: \"Newer applications should use a more modern algorithm\".\r\n\r\n`aes_encrypt` and `aes_decrypt` should use the key directly in CBC mode, as it does for both GCM and ECB mode. The output should then be the initialization vector (IV) prepended to the ciphertext – as is done with GCM mode:\r\n`[16-byte randomly generated IV | AES-CBC encrypted ciphertext]`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWe want to have the ciphertext output similar across different modes. OpenSSL's EVP_BytesToKey is effectively deprecated and their own documentation says not to use it. Instead, CBC mode will generate a random vector.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nAES-CBC output generated by the previous format will be incompatible with this change. That change was recently landed and we want to land this before CBC mode is used in practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nA new unit test in `DataFrameFunctionsSuite` was added to test both GCM and CBC modes. Also, a new standalone unit test suite was added in `ExpressionImplUtilsSuite` to test all the modes and various key lengths.\r\n```\r\nbuild/sbt \"sql/test:testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrameFunctionsSuite\"\r\nbuild/sbt \"sql/test:testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.ExpressionImplUtilsSuite\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nCBC values can be verified with `openssl enc` using the following command:\r\n```\r\necho -n \"[INPUT]\" | openssl enc -a -e -aes-256-cbc -iv [HEX IV] -K [HEX KEY]\r\necho -n \"Spark\" | openssl enc -a -e -aes-256-cbc -iv

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/39596 to fix more corner cases. It ignores the special column flag that requires qualified access for normal output attributes, as the flag should be effective only to metadata columns.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIt's very hard to make sure that we don't leak the special column flag. Since the bug has been in the Spark release for a while, there may be tables created with CTAS and the table schema contains the special flag.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nnew analysis

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nChange the error class_LEGACY_ERROR_TEMP_2022 to internal error as it cannot be accessed.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFix jira issue [SPARK-43257](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-43257). `ResolveNaturalAndUsingJoin` only handles `UsingJoin` and `NaturalJoin`,  and  all join types supported by `UsingJoin` and `NaturalJoin` are supported by natural join, so `commonNaturalJoinProcessing` will never go to the default branch and throw  `unsupportedNaturalJoinTypeError`. I think this error class could be replaced with internal error.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAlready exist

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr move `ExecutorClassLoader` from `repl` module to `core` module an put it into `executor` package, then `ArtifactManagerSuite` can test using maven.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, this pr removed reflection calls in the `Executor#addReplClassLoaderIfNeeded` due to `ExecutorClassLoader` and `Executor` are in the same module after this pr.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. `ExecutorClassLoader` only be used by `Executor`, it is more suitable for placing in the `core` module\r\n2. Make `ArtifactManagerSuite` can test using maven.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, just for maven test\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Pass GitHub

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n#### Make the pyspark UDF support annotating python dependencies and when executing UDF, the UDF worker creates a new python environment with provided python dependencies.\r\n\r\n - Supported spark mode: spark connect model / legacy mode\r\n - Supported UDF type: All kinds of pyspark UDFs\r\n    - SQL_BATCHED_UDF\r\n    - SQL_SCALAR_PANDAS_UDF\r\n    - SQL_GROUPED_MAP_PANDAS_UDF\r\n    - SQL_GROUPED_AGG_PANDAS_UDF\r\n    - SQL_WINDOW_AGG_PANDAS_UDF\r\n    - SQL_SCALAR_PANDAS_ITER_UDF\r\n    - SQL_MAP_PANDAS_ITER_UDF\r\n    - SQL_COGROUPED_MAP_PANDAS_UDF\r\n    - SQL_MAP_ARROW_ITER_UDF\r\n    - SQL_GROUPED_MAP_PANDAS_UDF_WITH_STATE\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Implementation sketch\r\n - Before starting the pyspark UDF worker process, the python environment with provided python packages is created, and pyspark UDF worker process is spawned using the provided python environment instead of default configured pyspark python. \r\n - Using `virtualenv` to create a python environment based on current python environment that pyspark uses, then using `pip install` to install provided python packages.\r\n - If user configures a NFS directory that is accessible by all spark nodes (readable/writable to spark driver, readable to all spark workers), then it prepares the python environment in driver side, otherwise it creates the python environment in spark worker side.\r\n - The python environment is cached in spark driver or worker side (depending on NFS directory enabled or not), we uses SHA1 over sorted pip requirements list as the python environment caching key.\r\n\r\n#### TODOs\r\n - For chained UDF functions, if they have different pip_requirements settings, we need to split them into separate PythonRunners\r\n - In frontend, the PR currently only supports annotating `pip_requirements` for `pandas_udf`, but for other types of UDFs, and for `mapInPandas` / `mapInArrow` the `pip_requirements` argument haven't been added.\r\n - Supports annotating python version for pyspark UDF, and in UDF execution, downloading python using provided python version and creating python environment using provided python version.\r\n - Using file lock during python environment creation, to avoid race conditions.\r\n - Unit tests\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n - For spark connect case, the client python environment is very likely to be different with pyspark server side python environment, this causes user's UDF function execution failure in pyspark server side.\r\n - Some machine learning third-party library (e.g. MLflow) requires pyspark UDF supporting  dependencies, because in ML cases, we need to run model inference by pyspark UDF in the exactly the same python environment that trains the model. Currently MLflow supports it by creating a child python process in pyspark UDF worker, and redirecting all UDF input data to the child python process to run model inference, this way it causes significant overhead, if pyspark UDF support builtin python dependency management then we don't need such poorly performing approach.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n```\r\n\r\n@pandas_udf(\"string\", pip_requirements=...)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n`pip_requirements` argument means either an iterable of pip requirement strings (e.g. ``[\"scikit-learn\", \"-r /path/to/req2.txt\", \"-c /path/to/constraints.txt\"]``) or the string path to a pip requirements file path on the local filesystem (e.g. ``\"/path/to/requirements.txt\"``) represents the pip requirements for the python UDF.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests to be added.\r\n\r\nManually tests:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import pandas_udf\r\n\r\nsc.setLogLevel(\"INFO\")\r\n\r\n@pandas_udf(\"string\", pip_requirements=[\"PyYAML==6.0\"])\r\ndef to_upper(s: pd.Series) -> pd.Series:\r\n    import yaml\r\n    return s.str.upper()
