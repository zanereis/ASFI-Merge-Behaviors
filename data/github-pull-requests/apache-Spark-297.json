This will make debugging easier. For this JIRA, I am scoping those for hive table scans only. In case table scans which happen via codegen (eg. convertMetastore and spark native tables), this PR will not affect things.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2018-01-10 at 3

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n**Proposal**\r\n\r\nAdd a per-query ID to the codegen stages as represented by `WholeStageCodegenExec` operators. This ID will be used in\r\n-  the explain output of the physical plan, and in\r\n- the generated class name.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, this ID will be stable within a query, counting up from 1 in depth-first post-order for all the `WholeStageCodegenExec` inserted into a plan.\r\nThe ID value 0 is reserved for \"free-floating\" `WholeStageCodegenExec` objects, which may have been created for one-off purposes, e.g. for fallback handling of codegen stages that failed to codegen the whole stage and wishes to codegen a subset of the children operators (as seen in `org.apache.spark.sql.execution.FileSourceScanExec#doExecute`).\r\n\r\nExample: for the following query:\r\n```scala\r\nscala> spark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold\", 1)\r\n\r\nscala> val df1 = spark.range(10).select('id as 'x, 'id + 1 as 'y).orderBy('x).select('x + 1 as 'z, 'y)\r\ndf1: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [z: bigint, y: bigint]\r\n\r\nscala> val df2 = spark.range(5)\r\ndf2: org.apache.spark.sql.Dataset[Long] = [id: bigint]\r\n\r\nscala> val query = df1.join(df2, 'z === 'id)\r\nquery: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [z: bigint, y: bigint ... 1 more field]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe explain output before the change is:\r\n```scala\r\nscala> query.explain\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\n*SortMergeJoin [z#9L], [id#13L], Inner\r\n:- *Sort [z#9L ASC NULLS FIRST], false, 0\r\n:  +- Exchange hashpartitioning(z#9L, 200)\r\n:     +- *Project [(x#3L + 1) AS z#9L, y#4L]\r\n:        +- *Sort [x#3L ASC NULLS FIRST], true, 0\r\n:           +- Exchange rangepartitioning(x#3L ASC NULLS FIRST, 200)\r\n:              +- *Project [id#0L AS x#3L, (id#0L + 1) AS y#4L]\r\n:                 +- *Range (0, 10, step=1, splits=8)\r\n+- *Sort [id#13L ASC NULLS FIRST], false, 0\r\n   +- Exchange hashpartitioning(id#13L, 200)\r\n      +- *Range (0, 5, step=1, splits=8)\r\n```\r\nNote how codegen'd operators are annotated with a prefix `\"*\"`. See how the `SortMergeJoin` operator and its direct children `Sort` operators are adjacent and all annotated with the `\"*\"`, so it's hard to tell they're actually in separate codegen stages.\r\n\r\nand after this change it'll be:\r\n```scala\r\nscala> query.explain\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\n*(6) SortMergeJoin [z#9L], [id#13L], Inner\r\n:- *(3) Sort [z#9L ASC NULLS FIRST], false, 0\r\n:  +- Exchange hashpartitioning(z#9L, 200)\r\n:     +- *(2) Project [(x#3L + 1) AS z#9L, y#4L]\r\n:        +- *(2) Sort [x#3L ASC NULLS FIRST], true, 0\r\n:           +- Exchange rangepartitioning(x#3L ASC NULLS FIRST, 200)\r\n:              +- *(1) Project [id#0L AS x#3L, (id#0L + 1) AS y#4L]\r\n:                 +- *(1) Range (0, 10, step=1, splits=8)\r\n+- *(5) Sort [id#13L ASC NULLS FIRST], false, 0\r\n   +- Exchange hashpartitioning(id#13L, 200)\r\n      +- *(4) Range (0, 5, step=1, splits=8)\r\n```\r\nNote that the annotated prefix becomes `\"*(id) \"`. See how the `SortMergeJoin` operator and its direct children `Sort` operators have different codegen stage IDs.\r\n\r\nIt'll also show up in the name of the generated class, as a suffix in the format of `GeneratedClass$GeneratedIterator$id`.\r\n\r\nFor example, note how `GeneratedClass$GeneratedIteratorForCodegenStage3` and `GeneratedClass$GeneratedIteratorForCodegenStage6` in the following stack trace corresponds to the IDs shown in the explain output above:\r\n```\r\n\"Executor task launch worker for task 424@12957\" daemon prio=5 tid=0x58 nid=NA runnable\r\n  java.lang.Thread.State: RUNNABLE\r\n\t  at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.UnsafeExternalRowSorter.insertRow(UnsafeExternalRowSorter.java:109)\r\n\t  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.GeneratedClass$GeneratedIteratorForCodegenStage3.sort_addToSorter$(generated.java:32)\r\n\t  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.GeneratedClass$GeneratedIteratorForCodegenStage3.processNext(generated.java:41)\r\n\t  at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.BufferedRowIterator.hasNext(BufferedRowIterator.java:43)\r\n\t  at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.WholeStageCodegenExec$$anonfun$9$$anon$1.hasNext(WholeStageCodegenExec.scala:494)\r\n\t  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.GeneratedClass$GeneratedIteratorForCodegenStage6.findNextInnerJoinRows$(generated.java:42)\r\n\t  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.GeneratedClass$GeneratedIteratorForCodegenStage6.processNext(generated.java:101)\r\n\t  at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.BufferedRowIterator.hasNext(BufferedRowIterator.java:43)\r\n\t  at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.WholeStageCodegenExec$$anonfun$11$$anon$2.hasNext(WholeStageCodegenExec.scala:513)\r\n\t  at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.SparkPlan$$anonfun$2.apply(SparkPlan.scala:253)\r\n\t  at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.SparkPlan$$anonfun$2.apply(SparkPlan.scala:247)\r\n\t  at org.apache.spark.rdd.RDD$$anonfun$mapPartitionsInternal$1$$anonfun$apply$25.apply(RDD.scala:828)\r\n\t  at org.apache.spark.rdd.RDD$$anonfun$mapPartitionsInternal$1$$anonfun$apply$25.apply(RDD.scala:828)\r\n\t  at org.apache.spark.rdd.MapPartitionsRDD.compute(MapPartitionsRDD.scala:38)\r\n\t  at org.apache.spark.rdd.RDD.computeOrReadCheckpoint(RDD.scala:324)\r\n\t  at org.apache.spark.rdd.RDD.iterator(RDD.scala:288)\r\n\t  at org.apache.spark.scheduler.ResultTask.runTask(ResultTask.scala:87)\r\n\t  at org.apache.spark.scheduler.Task.run(Task.scala:109)\r\n\t  at org.apache.spark.executor.Executor$TaskRunner.run(Executor.scala:345)\r\n\t  at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1142)\r\n\t  at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:617)\r\n\t  at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:748)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Rationale**\r\n\r\nRight now, the codegen from Spark SQL lacks the means to differentiate between a couple of things:\r\n\r\n1. It's hard to tell which physical operators are in the same WholeStageCodegen stage. Note that this \"stage\" is a separate notion from Spark's RDD execution stages; this one is only to delineate codegen units.\r\nThere can be adjacent physical operators that are both codegen'd but are in separate codegen stages. Some of this is due to hacky implementation details, such as the case with `SortMergeJoin` and its `Sort` inputs -- they're hard coded to be split into separate stages although both are codegen'd.\r\nWhen printing out the explain output of the physical plan, you'd only see the codegen'd physical operators annotated with a preceding star (`'*'`) but would have no way to figure out if they're in the same stage.\r\n\r\n2. Performance/error diagnosis\r\nThe generated code has class/method names that are hard to differentiate between queries or even between codegen stages within the same query. If we use a Java-level profiler to collect profiles, or if we encounter a Java-level exception with a stack trace in it, it's really hard to tell which part of a query it's at.\r\nBy introducing a per-query codegen stage ID, we'd at least be able to know which codegen stage (and in turn, which group of physical operators) was a profile tick or an exception happened.\r\n\r\nThe reason why this proposal uses a per-query ID is because it's stable within a query, so that multiple runs of the same query will see the same resulting IDs. This both benefits understandability for users, and also it plays well with the codegen cache in Spark SQL which uses the generated source code as the key.\r\n\r\nThe downside to using per-query IDs as opposed to a per-session or globally incrementing ID is of course we can't tell apart different query runs with this ID alone. But for now I believe this is a good enough tradeoff.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests. This PR does not involve any runtime behavior changes other than some name changes.\r\nThe SQL query test suites that compares explain outputs have been updates to ignore the newly added

race in the code is because the handle might update\r\nits state to the wrong state if the connection handling\r\nthread is still processing incoming data; so the handle\r\nneeds to wait for the connection to finish up before\r\nchecking the final state.\r\n\r\nThe race in the test is because when waiting for a handle\r\nto reach a final state, the waitFor() method needs to wait\r\nuntil all handle state is updated (which also includes\r\nwaiting for the connection thread above to finish).\r\nOtherwise, waitFor() may return too early, which would cause\r\na bunch of different races (like the listener not being yet\r\nnotified of the state change, or being in the middle of\r\nbeing notified, or the handle not being properly disposed\r\nand causing postChecks() to assert).\r\n\r\nOn top of that I found, by code inspection, a couple of\r\npotential races that could make a handle end up in the\r\nwrong state when being killed.\r\n\r\nTested by running the existing unit tests a lot (and not\r\nseeing the errors I was seeing before).","created_at":"2018-01-10T20:55:25Z","updated_at":"2018-01-17T17:33:21Z","closed_at":"2018-01-16T06:44:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e02127b088d1da497e05b0579e1416f8cb450607","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20223/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20223/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/20223/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8d52338eed18bcc82ad04179e966f9eca064e68c","head":{"label":"vanzin:SPARK-23020","ref":"SPARK-23020","sha":"8d52338eed18bcc82ad04179e966f9eca064e68c","user":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18302272,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODMwMjI3Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"vanzin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSpark ui about the contents of the form need to have hidden and show features, when the table records very much. Because sometimes you do not care about the record of the table, you just want to see the contents of the next table, but you have to scroll the scroll bar for a long time to see the contents of the next table.\r\n\r\nCurrently we have about 500 workers, but I just wanted to see the logs for the running applications table. I had to scroll through the scroll bars for a long time to see the logs for the running applications table.\r\n\r\nIn order to ensure functional consistency, I modified the Master Page, Worker Page, Job Page, Stage Page, Task Page, Configuration Page, Storage Page, Pool Page.\r\n\r\nfix

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe reader schema is said to be evolved (or projected) when it changed after the data is written. The followings are already supported in file-based data sources. Note that partition columns are not maintained in files. In this PR, `column` means `non-partition column`.\r\n\r\n   1. Add a column\r\n   2. Hide a column\r\n   3. Change a column position \r\n   4. Change a column type (upcast)\r\n\r\nThis issue aims to guarantee users a backward-compatible read-schema test coverage on file-based data sources and to prevent future regressions by *adding read schema tests explicitly*.\r\n\r\nHere, we consider safe changes without data loss. For example, data type change should be from small types to larger types like `int`-to-`long`, not vice versa.\r\n\r\nAs of today, in the master branch, file-based data sources have the following coverage.\r\n\r\nFile Format | Coverage  | Note\r\n----------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------\r\nTEXT          | N/A            | Schema consists of a single string column.\r\nCSV            | 1, 2, 4        |\r\nJSON          | 1, 2, 3, 4    |\r\nORC            | 1, 2, 3, 4    | Native vectorized ORC reader has the widest coverage among ORC formats.\r\nPARQUET   | 1, 2, 3        |\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the Jenkins with newly added test suites.","created_at":"2018-01-09T18:35:43Z","updated_at":"2018-07-13T16:11:31Z","closed_at":"2018-07-12T21:13:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"39b39255ffe664506e394ba32f4ef75bab57e1e6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20208/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20208/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/20208/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a7064ac0bc7b56ffffa3e322f31bda8a45bd9517","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-SCHEMA-EVOLUTION","ref":"SPARK-SCHEMA-EVOLUTION","sha":"a7064ac0bc7b56ffffa3e322f31bda8a45bd9517","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"e2c7e09f742a7e522efd74fe8e14c2620afdb522","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is mostly from https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/13775\r\n\r\nThe wrapper solution is pretty good for string/binary type, as the ORC column vector doesn't keep bytes in a continuous memory region, and has a significant overhead when copying the data to Spark columnar batch. For other cases, the wrapper solution is almost same with the current solution.\r\n\r\nI think we can treat the wrapper solution as a baseline and keep improving the writing to Spark solution.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nexisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nNote that this PR was made based on the top of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/20151. So, it almost leaves the main codes intact.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to add a script for the preparation of automatic PySpark coverage generation. Now, it's difficult to check the actual coverage in case of PySpark. With this script, it allows to run tests by the way we did via `run-tests` script before. The usage is exactly the same with `run-tests` script as this basically wraps it.\r\n\r\nThis script and PR alone should also be useful. I was asked about how to run this before, and seems some reviewers (including me) need this. It would be also useful to run it manually.\r\n\r\nIt usually requires a small diff in normal Python projects but PySpark cases are a bit different because apparently we are unable to track the coverage after it's forked. So, here, I made a custom worker that forces the coverage, based on the top of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/20151.\r\n\r\nI made a simple demo. Please take a look - https://spark-test.github.io/pyspark-coverage-site. \r\n\r\nTo show up the structure, this PR adds the files as below:\r\n\r\n```\r\npython\r\n├── .coveragerc  # Runtime configuration when we run the script.\r\n├── run-tests-with-coverage  # The script that has coverage support and wraps run-tests script.\r\n└── test_coverage  # Directories that have files required when running coverage.\r\n    ├── conf\r\n    │   └── spark-defaults.conf  # Having the configuration 'spark.python.daemon.module'.\r\n    ├── coverage_daemon.py  # A daemon having custom fix and wrapping our daemon.py\r\n    └── sitecustomize.py  # Initiate coverage with COVERAGE_PROCESS_START\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that this PR has a minor nit:\r\n\r\n[This scope](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/04e44b37cc04f62fbf9e08c7076349e0a4d12ea8/python/pyspark/daemon.py#L148-L169) in `daemon.py` is not in the coverage results as basically I am producing the coverage results in `worker.py` separately and then merging it. I believe it's not a big deal.\r\n\r\nIn a followup, I might have a site that has a single up-to-date PySpark coverage from the master branch as the fallback / default, or have a site that has multiple PySpark coverages and the site link will be left to each pull request.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested. Usage is the same with the existing Python test script - `./python/run-tests`. For example,\r\n\r\n```\r\nsh run-tests-with-coverage --python-executables=python3 --modules=pyspark-sql\r\n```\r\n\r\nRunning this will generate HTMLs under `./python/test_coverage/htmlcov`.\r\n  \r\nConsole output example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsh run-tests-with-coverage --python-executables=python3,python --modules=pyspark-core\r\nRunning PySpark tests. Output is in /.../spark/python/unit-tests.log\r\nWill test against the following Python executables: ['python3', 'python']\r\nWill test the following Python modules: ['pyspark-core']\r\nStarting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn this PR stage blacklisting is propagated to UI by introducing a new Spark listener event (SparkListenerExecutorBlacklistedForStage) which indicates the executor is blacklisted for a stage. Either because of the number of failures are exceeded a limit given for an executor (spark.blacklist.stage.maxFailedTasksPerExecutor) or because of the whole node is blacklisted for a stage (spark.blacklist.stage.maxFailedExecutorsPerNode). In case of the node is blacklisting all executors will listed as blacklisted for the stage. \r\n\r\nBlacklisting state for a selected stage can be seen \"Aggregated Metrics by Executor\" table's blacklisting column, where after this change three possible labels could be found:\r\n- \"for application\": when the executor is blacklisted for the application (see the configuration spark.blacklist.application.maxFailedTasksPerExecutor for details) \r\n- \"for stage\": when the executor is **only** blacklisted for the stage \r\n- \"false\" : when the executor is not blacklisted at all\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nIt is tested both manually and with unit tests. \r\n\r\n#### Unit tests\r\n\r\n- HistoryServerSuite\r\n- TaskSetBlacklistSuite\r\n- AppStatusListenerSuite\r\n\r\n#### Manual test for executor blacklisting \r\n\r\nRunning Spark as a local cluster:\r\n```\r\n$ bin/spark-shell --master \"local-cluster[2,1,1024]\" --conf \"spark.blacklist.enabled=true\" --conf \"spark.blacklist.stage.maxFailedTasksPerExecutor=1\" --conf \"spark.blacklist.application.maxFailedTasksPerExecutor=10\" --conf \"spark.eventLog.enabled=true\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nExecuting:\r\n``` scala\r\nimport org.apache.spark.SparkEnv\r\n\r\nsc.parallelize(1 to 10, 10).map { x =>\r\n  if (SparkEnv.get.executorId == \"0\") throw new RuntimeException(\"Bad executor\")\r\n  else (x % 3, x)\r\n}.reduceByKey((a, b) => a + b).collect()\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo see result check the \"Aggregated Metrics by Executor\" section at the bottom of picture:\r\n\r\n![UI screenshot for stage level blacklisting executor](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12905283/stage_blacklisting.png)\r\n\r\n#### Manual test for node blacklisting \r\n\r\nRunning Spark as on a cluster:\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\n./bin/spark-shell --master yarn --deploy-mode client --executor-memory=2G --num-executors=8 --conf \"spark.blacklist.enabled=true\" --conf \"spark.blacklist.stage.maxFailedTasksPerExecutor=1\" --conf \"spark.blacklist.stage.maxFailedExecutorsPerNode=1\"  --conf \"spark.blacklist.application.maxFailedTasksPerExecutor=10\" --conf \"spark.eventLog.enabled=true\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the job was:\r\n\r\n``` scala\r\nimport org.apache.spark.SparkEnv\r\n\r\nsc.parallelize(1 to 10000, 10).map { x =>\r\n  if (SparkEnv.get.executorId.toInt >= 4) throw new RuntimeException(\"Bad executor\")\r\n    else (x % 3, x)\r\n}.reduceByKey((a, b) => a + b).collect()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe result is:\r\n\r\n![UI screenshot for stage level node blacklisting](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12906833/node_blacklisting_for_stage.png)\r\n\r\nHere you can see apiros3.gce.test.com was node blacklisted for the stage because of failures on executor 4 and 5. As expected executor 3 is also blacklisted even it has no failures itself but sharing the node with 4 and 5.\r\n","created_at":"2018-01-09T14:42:22Z","updated_at":"2018-04-26T20:07:45Z","closed_at":"2018-01-24T17:38:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b4d67219d128be85dc2b75ad1366de9d3471de7b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20203/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20203/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/20203/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/882bb9ecd0de0ee916e6b1f75eda48c5a27f5ab6","head":{"label":"attilapiros:SPARK-22577","ref":"SPARK-22577","sha":"882bb9ecd0de0ee916e6b1f75eda48c5a27f5ab6","user":{"login":"attilapiros","id":2017933,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTc5MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2017933?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros","html_url":"https://github.com/attilapiros","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":114023960,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTQwMjM5NjA=","name":"spark","full_name":"attilapiros/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"attilapiros","id":2017933,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTc5MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2017933?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros","html_url":"https://github.com/attilapiros","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/attilapiros/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\na new interface which allows data source to report partitioning and avoid shuffle at Spark side.\r\n\r\nThe design is pretty like the internal distribution/partitioing framework. Spark defines a `Distribution` interfaces and several concrete implementations, and ask the data source to report a `Partitioning`, the `Partitioning` should tell Spark if it can satisfy a `Distribution` or not.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nnew

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nhttps://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/spark-branch-2.3-test-sbt-hadoop-2.6/\r\n\r\nThe test suite DataSourceWithHiveMetastoreCatalogSuite of Branch 2.3 always failed in hadoop 2.6 \r\n\r\nThe table `t` exists in `default`, but `runSQLHive` reported the table does not exist. Obviously, Hive client's default database is different. The fix is to clean the environment and use `DEFAULT` as the database.\r\n\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.execution.QueryExecutionException: FAILED: SemanticException [Error 10001]: Line 1:14 Table

change allows a user to submit a Spark application on kubernetes\r\nhaving to provide a single image, instead of one image for each type\r\nof container. The image's entry point now takes an extra argument that\r\nidentifies the process that is being started.\r\n\r\nThe configuration still allows the user to provide different images\r\nfor each container type if they so desire.\r\n\r\nOn top of that, the entry point was simplified a bit to share more\r\ncode; mainly, the same env variable is used to propagate the user-defined\r\nclasspath to the different containers.\r\n\r\nAside from being modified to match the new behavior, the\r\n'build-push-docker-images.sh' script was renamed to 'docker-image-tool.sh'\r\nto more closely match its purpose; the old name was a little awkward\r\nand now also not entirely correct, since there is a single image. It\r\nwas also moved to 'bin' since it's not necessarily an admin tool.\r\n\r\nDocs have been updated to match the new behavior.\r\n\r\nTested locally with

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch modifies Spark's `MemoryAllocator` implementations so that `free(MemoryBlock)` mutates the passed block to clear pointers (in the off-heap case) or null out references to backing `long[]` arrays (in the on-heap case). The goal of this change is to add an extra layer of defense against use-after-free bugs because currently it's hard to detect corruption caused by blind writes to freed memory blocks.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit tests in `PlatformSuite`, including new tests for existing functionality because we did not have sufficient mutation coverage of the on-heap memory allocator's

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nRemove the use of FQDN to access the driver because it assumes that it's set up in a DNS zone - `cluster.local` which is common but not ubiquitous\r\nNote that we already access the in-cluster API server through `kubernetes.default.svc`, so, by extension, this should work as well.\r\nThe alternative is to introduce DNS zones for both of those addresses.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests\r\n\r\ncc @vanzin @liyinan926 @mridulm @mccheah

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nChainedIterator.UnsafeExternalSorter remains a Queue of UnsafeSorterIterator. When call `getIterator` function of UnsafeExternalSorter, UnsafeExternalSorter passes an ArrayList of UnsafeSorterSpillReader to the constructor of UnsafeExternalSorter. But, UnsafeSorterSpillReader maintains a byte array as buffer, witch capacity is more than 1 MB. When spilling frequently, this case maybe causes OOM.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I try to change buffer allocation in UnsafeSorterSpillReader lazily.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests.\r\n","created_at":"2018-01-08T04:36:47Z","updated_at":"2020-01-15T00:06:15Z","closed_at":"2020-01-15T00:06:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5658053542fc0e159a71d2d95c7f99e88dccba68","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

resources happen to be constrained on an executor the first time a broadcast variable is instantiated it is persisted to disk by the BlockManager. Consequently, every subsequent call to TorrentBroadcast::readBroadcastBlock from other instances of that broadcast variable spawns another instance of the underlying value. That is, broadcast variables are spawned once per executor **unless** memory is constrained, in which case every instance of a broadcast variable is provided with a unique copy of the underlying value.\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes the above by explicitly caching the underlying values using weak references in a ReferenceMap.","created_at":"2018-01-08T03:11:48Z","updated_at":"2018-01-12T14:01:43Z","closed_at":"2018-01-12T07:30:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"90f48f876133434c1907ecb72cfbef9a664e27da","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20183/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20183/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/20183/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a6e5e810402d0fc807d86dba9f699d2851be1f3a","head":{"label":"ho3rexqj:fix/cache-broadcast-values","ref":"fix/cache-broadcast-values","sha":"a6e5e810402d0fc807d86dba9f699d2851be1f3a","user":{"login":"ho3rexqj","id":24759779,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU5Nzc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24759779?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ho3rexqj","html_url":"https://github.com/ho3rexqj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ho3rexqj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ho3rexqj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ho3rexqj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ho3rexqj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ho3rexqj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ho3rexqj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ho3rexqj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ho3rexqj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ho3rexqj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":116607654,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTY2MDc2NTQ=","name":"spark","full_name":"ho3rexqj/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ho3rexqj","id":24759779,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzU5Nzc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24759779?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ho3rexqj","html_url":"https://github.com/ho3rexqj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ho3rexqj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ho3rexqj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ho3rexqj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ho3rexqj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ho3rexqj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ho3rexqj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ho3rexqj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ho3rexqj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ho3rexqj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ho3rexqj/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes a longstanding correctness bug in `GenerateUnsafeRowJoiner`. This class was introduced in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/7821 (July 2015 / Spark 1.5.0+) and is used to combine pairs of UnsafeRows in TungstenAggregationIterator, CartesianProductExec, and AppendColumns.\r\n\r\n### Bugs fixed by this patch\r\n\r\n1. **Incorrect combining of null-tracking bitmaps**: when concatenating two UnsafeRows, the implementation \"Concatenate the two bitsets together into a single one, taking padding into account\". If one row has no columns then it has a bitset size of 0, but the code was incorrectly assuming that if the left row had a non-zero number of fields then the right row would also have at least one field, so it was copying invalid bytes and and treating them as part of the bitset. I'm not sure whether this bug was also present in the original implementation or whether it was introduced in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/7892 (which fixed another bug in this code).\r\n2. **Incorrect updating of data offsets for null variable-length fields**: after updating the bitsets and copying fixed-length and variable-length data, we need to perform adjustments to the offsets pointing the start of variable length fields's data. The existing code was _conditionally_ adding a fixed offset to correct for the new length of the combined row, but it is unsafe to do this if the variable-length field has a null value: we always represent nulls by storing `0` in the fixed-length slot, but this code was incorrectly incrementing those values. This bug was present since the original version of `GenerateUnsafeRowJoiner`.\r\n\r\n### Why this bug remained latent for so long\r\n\r\nThe PR which introduced `GenerateUnsafeRowJoiner` features several randomized tests, including tests of the cases where one side of the join has no fields and where string-valued fields are null. However, the existing assertions were too weak to uncover this bug:\r\n\r\n- If a null field has a non-zero value in its fixed-length data slot then this will not cause problems for field accesses because the null-tracking bitmap should still be correct and we will not try to use the incorrect offset for anything.\r\n- If the null tracking bitmap is corrupted by joining against a row with no fields then the corruption occurs in field numbers past the actual field numbers contained in the row. Thus valid `isNullAt()` calls will not read the incorrectly-set bits.\r\n\r\nThe existing `GenerateUnsafeRowJoinerSuite` tests only exercised `.get()` and `isNullAt()`, but didn't actually check the UnsafeRows for bit-for-bit equality, preventing these bugs from failing assertions. It turns out that there was even a [GenerateUnsafeRowJoinerBitsetSuite](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/03377d2522776267a07b7d6ae9bddf79a4e0f516/sql/catalyst/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/expressions/codegen/GenerateUnsafeRowJoinerBitsetSuite.scala) but it looks like it also didn't catch this problem because it only tested the bitsets in an end-to-end fashion by accessing them through the `UnsafeRow` interface instead of actually comparing the bitsets' bytes.\r\n\r\n### Impact of these bugs\r\n\r\n- This bug will cause `equals()` and `hashCode()` to be incorrect for these rows, which will be problematic in case`GenerateUnsafeRowJoiner`'s results are used as join or grouping keys.\r\n- Chained / repeated invocations of `GenerateUnsafeRowJoiner` may result in reads from invalid null bitmap positions causing fields to incorrectly become NULL (see the end-to-end example below).\r\n  - It looks like this generally only happens in `CartesianProductExec`, which our query optimizer often avoids executing (usually we try to plan a `BroadcastNestedLoopJoin` instead).\r\n\r\n### End-to-end test case demonstrating the problem\r\n\r\nThe following query demonstrates how this bug may result in incorrect query results:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nset spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold=-1; -- Needed to trigger CartesianProductExec\r\n\r\ncreate table a as select * from values 1;\r\ncreate table b as select * from values 2;\r\n\r\nSELECT\r\n  t3.col1,\r\n  t1.col1\r\nFROM a t1\r\nCROSS JOIN b t2\r\nCROSS JOIN b t3\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis should return `(2, 1)` but instead was returning `(null, 1)`.\r\n\r\nColumn pruning ends up trimming off all columns from `t2`, so when `t2` joins with another table this triggers the bitmap-copying bug. This incorrect bitmap is subsequently copied again when performing the final join, causing the final output to have an incorrectly-set null bit for the first field.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nStrengthened the assertions in existing tests in GenerateUnsafeRowJoinerSuite. Also verified that the end-to-end test case which uncovered this now passes.\r\n

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe following SQL query should return zero rows, but in Spark it actually returns one row:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT 1 from (\r\n  SELECT 1 AS z,\r\n  MIN(a.x)\r\n  FROM (select 1 as x) a\r\n  WHERE false\r\n) b\r\nwhere b.z != b.z\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem stems from the `PushDownPredicate` rule: when this rule encounters a filter on top of an Aggregate operator, e.g. `Filter(Agg(...))`, it removes the original filter and adds a new filter onto Aggregate's child, e.g. `Agg(Filter(...))`. This is sometimes okay, but the case above is a counterexample: because there is no explicit `GROUP BY`, we are implicitly computing a global aggregate over the entire table so the original filter was not acting like a `HAVING` clause filtering the number of groups: if we push this filter then it fails to actually reduce the cardinality of the Aggregate output, leading to the wrong answer.\r\n\r\nIn 2016 I fixed a similar problem involving invalid pushdowns of data-independent filters (filters which reference no columns of the filtered relation). There was additional discussion after my fix was merged which pointed out that my patch was an incomplete fix (see #15289), but it looks I must have either misunderstood the comment or forgot to follow up on the additional points raised there.\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes the problem by choosing to never push down filters in cases where there are no grouping expressions.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes a severe asynchronous IO bug in Spark's Netty-based file transfer code. At a high-level, the problem is that an unsafe asynchronous `close()` of a pipe's source channel creates a race condition where file transfer code closes a file descriptor then attempts to read from it. If the closed file descriptor's number has been reused by an `open()` call then this invalid read may cause unrelated file operations to return incorrect results. **One manifestation of this problem is incorrect query results.**\r\n\r\nFor a high-level overview of how file download works, take a look at the control flow in `NettyRpcEnv.openChannel()`: this code creates a pipe to buffer results, then submits an asynchronous stream request to a lower-level TransportClient. The callback passes received data to the sink end of the pipe. The source end of the pipe is passed back to the caller of `openChannel()`. Thus `openChannel()` returns immediately and callers interact with the returned pipe source channel.\r\n\r\nBecause the underlying stream request is asynchronous, errors may occur after `openChannel()` has returned and after that method's caller has started to `read()` from the returned channel. For example, if a client requests an invalid stream from a remote server then the \"stream does not exist\" error may not be received from the remote server until after `openChannel()` has returned. In order to be able to propagate the \"stream does not exist\" error to the file-fetching application thread, this code wraps the pipe's source channel in a special `FileDownloadChannel` which adds an `setError(t: Throwable)` method, then calls this `setError()` method in the FileDownloadCallback's `onFailure` method.\r\n\r\nIt is possible for `FileDownloadChannel`'s `read()` and `setError()` methods to be called concurrently from different threads: the `setError()` method is called from within the Netty RPC system's stream callback handlers, while the `read()` methods are called from higher-level application code performing remote stream reads.\r\n\r\nThe problem lies in `setError()`: the existing code closed the wrapped pipe source channel. Because `read()` and `setError()` occur in different threads, this means it is possible for one thread to be calling `source.read()` while another asynchronously calls `source.close()`. Java's IO libraries do not guarantee that this will be safe and, in fact, it's possible for these operations to interleave in such a way that a lower-level `read()` system call occurs right after a `close()` call. In the best-case, this fails as a read of a closed file descriptor; in the worst-case, the file descriptor number has been re-used by an intervening `open()` operation and the read corrupts the result of an unrelated file IO operation being performed by a different thread.\r\n\r\nThe solution here is to remove the `stream.close()` call in `onError()`: the thread that is performing the `read()` calls is responsible for closing the stream in a `finally` block, so there's no need to close it here. If that thread is blocked in a `read()` then it will become unblocked when the sink end of the pipe is closed in `FileDownloadCallback.onFailure()`.\r\n\r\nAfter making this change, we also need to refine the `read()` method to always check for a `setError()` result, even if the underlying channel `read()` call has succeeded.\r\n\r\nThis patch also makes a slight cleanup to a dodgy-looking `catch e: Exception` block to use a safer `try-finally` error handling idiom.\r\n\r\nThis bug was introduced in SPARK-11956 / #9941 and is present in Spark 1.6.0+.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis fix was tested manually against a workload which non-deterministically hit this

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n(courtesy of @liancheng) \r\n\r\nSpark SQL supports both global aggregation and grouping aggregation. Global aggregation always return a single row with the initial aggregation state as the output, even there are zero input rows. Spark implements this by simply checking the number of grouping keys and treats an aggregation as a global aggregation if it has zero grouping keys.\r\n\r\nHowever, this simple principle drops the ball in the following case:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nspark.emptyDataFrame.dropDuplicates().agg(count($\"*\") as \"c\").show()\r\n// +---+\r\n// | c |\r\n// +---+\r\n// | 1 |\r\n// +---+\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe reason is that:\r\n\r\n1. `df.dropDuplicates()` is roughly translated into something equivalent to:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nval allColumns = df.columns.map { col }\r\ndf.groupBy(allColumns: _*).agg(allColumns.head, allColumns.tail: _*)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis translation is implemented in the rule `ReplaceDeduplicateWithAggregate`.\r\n\r\n2. `spark.emptyDataFrame` contains zero columns and zero rows.\r\n\r\nTherefore, rule `ReplaceDeduplicateWithAggregate` makes a confusing transformation roughly equivalent to the following one:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nspark.emptyDataFrame.dropDuplicates()\r\n=> spark.emptyDataFrame.groupBy().agg(Map.empty[String, String])\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above transformation is confusing because the resulting aggregate operator contains no grouping keys (because `emptyDataFrame` contains no columns), and gets recognized as a global aggregation. As a result, Spark SQL allocates a single row filled by the initial aggregation state and uses it as the output, and returns a wrong result.\r\n\r\nTo fix this issue, this PR tweaks `ReplaceDeduplicateWithAggregate` by appending a literal `1` to the grouping key list of the resulting `Aggregate` operator when the input plan contains zero output columns. In this way, `spark.emptyDataFrame.dropDuplicates()` is now translated into a grouping aggregation, roughly depicted as:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nspark.emptyDataFrame.dropDuplicates()\r\n=> spark.emptyDataFrame.groupBy(lit(1)).agg(Map.empty[String, String])\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich is now properly treated as a grouping aggregation and returns the correct answer.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit tests added\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSeems we can avoid type dispatch for each value when Java objection (from Pyrolite) -> Spark's internal data format because we know the schema ahead.\r\n\r\nI manually performed the benchmark as below:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n  test(\"EvaluatePython.fromJava / EvaluatePython.makeFromJava\") {\r\n    val numRows = 1000 * 1000\r\n    val numFields

 while (i < numRows) {\r\n      val row = RandomDataGenerator.randomRow(random, schema)\r\n      rows += row.toSeq.toArray\r\n      i += 1\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    val benchmark = new

{\r\n        EvaluatePython.fromJava(rows(i), schema)\r\n        i += 1\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    benchmark.addCase(\"After - EvaluatePython.makeFromJava\", 3) { _ =>\r\n      val fromJava =

}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nEvaluatePython.fromJava / EvaluatePython.makeFromJava: Best/Avg Time(ms)    Rate(M/s)   Per Row(ns)   Relative\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nBefore - EvaluatePython.fromJava              1265 / 1346          0.8        1264.8       1.0X\r\nAfter - EvaluatePython.makeFromJava            571 /  649          1.8         570.8       2.2X\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the structure is nested, I think the advantage should be larger than

test.","created_at":"2018-01-05T22:32:36Z","updated_at":"2018-01-24T19:35:39Z","closed_at":"2018-01-23T20:54:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fc66364a05913b237a2752c7aa0c527a9b35c6f0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20169/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20169/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/20169/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/668fcbac6b24e6c1e4b6c720459654ca8e88f03c","head":{"label":"vanzin:SPARK-17088","ref":"SPARK-17088","sha":"668fcbac6b24e6c1e4b6c720459654ca8e88f03c","user":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18302272,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODMwMjI3Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"vanzin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis commit modifies the Mesos submission client to allow the principal\r\nand secret to be provided indirectly via files.  The path to these files\r\ncan be specified either via Spark configuration or via environment\r\nvariable.\r\n\r\nAssuming these files are appropriately protected by FS/OS permissions\r\nthis means we don't ever leak the actual values in process info like ps\r\n\r\nEnvironment variable specification is useful because it allows you to\r\ninterpolate the location of this file when using per-user Mesos\r\ncredentials.\r\n\r\nFor some background as to why we have taken this approach I will briefly describe our set up.  On our systems we provide each authorised user account with their own Mesos credentials to provide certain security and audit guarantees to our customers. These credentials are managed by a central Secret management service. In our `spark-env.sh` we determine the appropriate secret and principal files to use depending on the user who is invoking Spark hence the need to inject these via environment variables as well as by configuration properties. So we set these environment variables appropriately and our Spark read in the contents of those files to authenticate itself with Mesos.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis is functionality we have been using it in production across multiple customer sites for some time. This has been in the field for around 18 months with no reported issues. These changes have been sufficient to meet our customer security and audit requirements.\r\n\r\nWe have been building and deploying custom builds of Apache Spark with various minor tweaks like this which we are now looking to contribute back into the community in order that we can rely upon stock Apache Spark builds and stop maintaining our own internal fork.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nPerform appropriate conversions for results coming from Python UDFs that return `datetime.date` or `datetime.datetime`.\r\n\r\nBefore this PR, Pyrolite would unpickle both `datetime.date` and `datetime.datetime` into a `java.util.Calendar`, which Spark SQL doesn't understand, which then leads to incorrect results. An example of such incorrect result is:\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> py_date = udf(datetime.date)\r\n>>> spark.range(1).select(py_date(lit(2017), lit(10), lit(30))).show(truncate=False)\r\n+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n|date(2017, 10, 30)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\r\n+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n|java.util.GregorianCalendar[time=?,areFieldsSet=false,areAllFieldsSet=false,lenient=true,zone=sun.util.calendar.ZoneInfo[id=\"America/Los_Angeles\",offset=-28800000,dstSavings=3600000,useDaylight=true,transitions=185,lastRule=java.util.SimpleTimeZone[id=America/Los_Angeles,offset=-28800000,dstSavings=3600000,useDaylight=true,startYear=0,startMode=3,startMonth=2,startDay=8,startDayOfWeek=1,startTime=7200000,startTimeMode=0,endMode=3,endMonth=10,endDay=1,endDayOfWeek=1,endTime=7200000,endTimeMode=0]],firstDayOfWeek=1,minimalDaysInFirstWeek=1,ERA=?,YEAR=2017,MONTH=9,WEEK_OF_YEAR=?,WEEK_OF_MONTH=?,DAY_OF_MONTH=30,DAY_OF_YEAR=?,DAY_OF_WEEK=?,DAY_OF_WEEK_IN_MONTH=?,AM_PM=0,HOUR=0,HOUR_OF_DAY=0,MINUTE=0,SECOND=0,MILLISECOND=?,ZONE_OFFSET=?,DST_OFFSET=?]|\r\n+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n```\r\nAfter this PR, the same query above would give correct results:\r\n```\r\n>>> spark.range(1).select(py_date(lit(2017), lit(10), lit(30))).show(truncate=False)\r\n+------------------+\r\n|date(2017, 10, 30)|\r\n+------------------+\r\n|2017-10-30        |\r\n+------------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\nAn explicit non-goal of this PR is to change the behavior of timezone awareness or timezone settings of `datetime.datetime` objects collected from a `DataFrame`.\r\nCurrently PySpark always returns such `datetime.datetime` objects as timezone unaware (naive) ones that respect Python's current local timezone (#19607 changed the default behavior for Pandas support but not for plain `collect()`). This PR does not change that behavior.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded some unit tests to `pyspark.sql.tests` for such UDFs, so that\r\n * `datetime.date` -> `StringType`\r\n *

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nUser-specified secrets are mounted into both the main container and init-container (when it is used) in a Spark driver/executor pod, using the `MountSecretsBootstrap`. Because `MountSecretsBootstrap` always adds new secret volumes for the secrets to the pod, the same secret volumes get added twice, one when mounting the secrets to the main container, and the other when mounting the secrets to the init-container. This PR fixes the issue by separating `MountSecretsBootstrap.mountSecrets` out into two methods: `addSecretVolumes` for adding secret volumes to a pod and `mountSecrets` for mounting secret volumes to a container, respectively. `addSecretVolumes` is only called once for each pod, whereas `mountSecrets` is called individually for the main container and the init-container (if it is used).\r\n\r\nRef:

The result is that remote dependencies specified through `spark.files` or `spark.jars` are not included in the list of remote dependencies to be downloaded by the init-container.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n#19201 introduced the following regression: given something like `df.withColumn(\"c\", lit(2))`, we're no longer picking up `c === 2` as a constraint and infer filters from it when joins are involved, which may lead to noticeable performance degradation.\r\n\r\nThis patch re-enables this optimization by picking up Aliases of Literals in Projection lists as constraints and making sure they're not treated as aliased columns.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit test was

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWe are now forced to use `pyspark/daemon.py` and `pyspark/worker.py` in PySpark.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't allow a custom modification for it (well, maybe we can still do this in a super hacky way though, for example, setting Python executable that has the custom modification). Because of this, for example, it's sometimes hard to debug what happens inside Python worker processes.\r\n\r\nThis is actually related with [SPARK-7721](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-7721) too as somehow Coverage is unable to detect the coverage from `os.fork`. If we have some custom fixes to force the coverage, it works fine.\r\n\r\nThis is also related with [SPARK-20368](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-20368). This JIRA describes Sentry support which (roughly) needs some changes within worker side. \r\n\r\nWith this configuration advanced users will be able to do a lot of pluggable workarounds and we can meet such potential needs in the future.\r\n\r\nAs an example, let's say if I configure the module `coverage_daemon` and had `coverage_daemon.py` in the python path:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport os\r\n\r\nfrom pyspark import daemon\r\n\r\n\r\nif \"COVERAGE_PROCESS_START\" in os.environ:\r\n    from pyspark.worker import main\r\n\r\n    def _cov_wrapped(*args, **kwargs):\r\n        import coverage\r\n        cov = coverage.coverage(\r\n            config_file=os.environ[\"COVERAGE_PROCESS_START\"])\r\n        cov.start()\r\n        try:\r\n            main(*args, **kwargs)\r\n        finally:\r\n            cov.stop()\r\n            cov.save()\r\n    daemon.worker_main = _cov_wrapped\r\n\r\n\r\nif __name__ == '__main__':\r\n    daemon.manager()\r\n```\r\n\r\nI can track the coverages in worker side too.\r\n\r\nMore importantly, we can leave the main code intact but allow some workarounds.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested.\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis problem reported by @yanlin-Lynn @ivoson and @LiangchangZ. Thanks!\r\n\r\nWhen we union 2 streams from kafka or other sources, while one of them have no continues data coming and in the same time task restart, this will cause an `IllegalStateException`. This mainly cause because the code in [MicroBatchExecution](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/streaming/MicroBatchExecution.scala#L190) , while one stream has no continues data, its comittedOffset same with availableOffset during `populateStartOffsets`, and `currentPartitionOffsets` not properly handled in KafkaSource. Also, maybe we should also consider this scenario in other Source.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdd a UT in KafkaSourceSuite.scala\r\n","created_at":"2018-01-04T11:59:02Z","updated_at":"2018-01-16T08:22:37Z","closed_at":"2018-01-16T06:04:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"60601b70903f4786776420151c6fc367f1da256d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20150/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20150/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/20150/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/bf8af29f155b776b171f2424e2adac86151a576d","head":{"label":"xuanyuanking:SPARK-22956","ref":"SPARK-22956","sha":"bf8af29f155b776b171f2424e2adac86151a576d","user":{"login":"xuanyuanking","id":4833765,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MzM3NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4833765?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking","html_url":"https://github.com/xuanyuanking","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52511431,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MjUxMTQzMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"xuanyuanking/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xuanyuanking","id":4833765,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MzM3NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4833765?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking","html_url":"https://github.com/xuanyuanking","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xuanyuanking/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nUser-specified secrets are mounted into both the main container and init-container (when it is used) in a Spark driver/executor pod, using the `MountSecretsBootstrap`. Because `MountSecretsBootstrap` always adds new secret volumes for the secrets to the pod, the same secret volumes get added twice, one when mounting the secrets to the main container, and the other when mounting the secrets to the init-container. This PR fixes the issue by separating `MountSecretsBootstrap.mountSecrets` out into two methods: `addSecretVolumes` for adding secret volumes to a pod and `mountSecrets` for mounting secret volumes to a container, respectively. `addSecretVolumes` is only called once for each pod, whereas `mountSecrets` is called individually for the main container and the init-container (if it is used).\r\n\r\nRef: https://github.com/apache-spark-on-k8s/spark/issues/594. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tested.\r\n\r\n@vanzin @jiangxb1987 @ueshin This is to fix a critical bug in 2.3.

tested?\r\n\r\n1) test-only of HiveExternalCatalogVersionsSuite on several platforms. Tested bad mirror, read timeout, and redirects.\r\n2) ./dev/run-tests\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-01-04T04:53:13Z","updated_at":"2018-03-05T23:05:11Z","closed_at":"2018-01-05T18:01:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"35e6dff030397c970f88ce5820e680e334c6fc6c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20147/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20147/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/20147/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7b58d994f485255ffad59ed9ffb480a64a00cea2","head":{"label":"bersprockets:SPARK-22940-alt","ref":"SPARK-22940-alt","sha":"7b58d994f485255ffad59ed9ffb480a64a00cea2","user":{"login":"bersprockets","id":21131848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTMxODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21131848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets","html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":115567071,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTU1NjcwNzE=","name":"spark","full_name":"bersprockets/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bersprockets","id":21131848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTMxODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21131848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets","html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is the second attempt of #18684 , NIO's Files API doesn't override `skip` method for `InputStream`, so it will bring in performance issue (mentioned in #20119).

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`FoldablePropagation` is a little tricky as it needs to handle attributes that are miss-derived from children, e.g. outer join outputs. This rule does a kind of stop-able tree transform, to skip to apply this rule when hit a node which may have miss-derived attributes.\r\n\r\nLogically we should be able to apply this rule above the unsupported nodes, by just treating the unsupported nodes as leaf nodes. This PR improves this rule to not stop the tree transformation, but reduce the foldable expressions that we want to propagate.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nexisting tests\r\n

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr modified `elt` to output binary for binary inputs.\r\n`elt` in the current master always output data as a string. But, in some databases (e.g., MySQL), if all inputs are binary, `elt` also outputs binary (Also, this might be a small surprise).\r\nThis pr is related to #19977.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, our CREATE TABLE syntax require the EXACT order of clauses. It is pretty hard to remember the exact order. Thus, this PR is to make optional clauses order insensitive for `CREATE TABLE` SQL statement.\r\n\r\n```\r\nCREATE [TEMPORARY] TABLE [IF NOT EXISTS] [db_name.]table_name\r\n    [(col_name1 col_type1 [COMMENT col_comment1], ...)]\r\n    USING datasource\r\n    [OPTIONS (key1=val1, key2=val2, ...)]\r\n    [PARTITIONED BY (col_name1, col_name2, ...)]\r\n    [CLUSTERED BY (col_name3, col_name4, ...) INTO num_buckets BUCKETS]\r\n    [LOCATION path]\r\n    [COMMENT table_comment]\r\n    [TBLPROPERTIES (key1=val1, key2=val2, ...)]\r\n    [AS select_statement]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe proposal is to make the following clauses order insensitive. \r\n```\r\n    [OPTIONS (key1=val1, key2=val2, ...)]\r\n    [PARTITIONED BY (col_name1, col_name2, ...)]\r\n    [CLUSTERED BY (col_name3, col_name4, ...) INTO num_buckets BUCKETS]\r\n    [LOCATION path]\r\n    [COMMENT table_comment]\r\n    [TBLPROPERTIES (key1=val1, key2=val2, ...)]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe same idea is also applicable to Create Hive Table. \r\n```\r\nCREATE [EXTERNAL] TABLE [IF NOT EXISTS] [db_name.]table_name\r\n    [(col_name1[:] col_type1 [COMMENT col_comment1], ...)]\r\n    [COMMENT table_comment]\r\n    [PARTITIONED BY (col_name2[:] col_type2 [COMMENT col_comment2], ...)]\r\n    [ROW FORMAT row_format]\r\n    [STORED AS file_format]\r\n    [LOCATION path]\r\n    [TBLPROPERTIES (key1=val1, key2=val2, ...)]\r\n    [AS select_statement]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe proposal is to make the following clauses order insensitive. \r\n```\r\n    [COMMENT table_comment]\r\n    [PARTITIONED BY (col_name2[:] col_type2 [COMMENT col_comment2], ...)]\r\n    [ROW FORMAT row_format]\r\n    [STORED AS file_format]\r\n    [LOCATION path]\r\n    [TBLPROPERTIES (key1=val1, key2=val2, ...)]\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch

See some discussion in the original PR: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/19527 or read below for what this PR includes:\r\n* configedCategorySize: I reverted this to return an Array.  I realized the original setup (which I had recommended in the original PR) caused the whole model to be serialized in the UDF.\r\n* encoder: I reorganized the logic to show what I meant in the comment in the previous PR.  I think it's simpler but am open to suggestions.\r\n\r\nI also made some small style cleanups based on IntelliJ warnings.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting unit
