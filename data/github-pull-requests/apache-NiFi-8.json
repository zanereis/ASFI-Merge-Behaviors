Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-13429](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-13429) Corrects OpenPGP Packet detection in the `EncryptContentPGP` Processor. Packet detection capabilities introduced in NiFi 1.15.0 relied on attempting to read an OpenPGP Packet from an input stream to determine whether the input FlowFile contained OpenPGP messages from the `SignContentPGP` Processor. The Bouncy Castle `readPacket()` method can evaluate some types of input files, such as JPEG images, as containing experimental packet headers, resulting in incorrect content detection and producing invalid OpenPGP messages.\r\n\r\nChanges include using a small set of expected packet tags to improve the fidelity of the content detection process.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-13424](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-13424) Changes the Application Bearer Token signing algorithm from `PS512` to `EdDSA` based on `Ed25519` for Elliptic Curve Cryptography described in [RFC 8032](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8032).\r\n\r\nChanges replace RSA key pair generation with `Ed25519`, which has been support as a standard signing algorithm for Java since [JEP 339](https://openjdk.org/jeps/339) introduced support in Java 15.\r\n\r\nThe implementation includes `Ed25519Signer` and `Ed25519Verifier` classes, which implement the corresponding interfaces from the [Nimbus JOSE + JWT](https://connect2id.com/products/nimbus-jose-jwt) library. The Nimbus library includes `Ed25519` implementations, but requires [Google Tink](https://developers.google.com/tink) instead of using native [java.security.Signature](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs//api/java.base/java/security/Signature.html) methods.\r\n\r\nJSON Web Tokens signed using `PS512` require at least 1 KB in each HTTP request sent from an authenticated client browser. The `EdDSA` algorithm with `Ed25519` signatures require less than half that size for the serialized and encoded token. The `EdDSA` algorithm provides as good or better security properties as RSASSA-PSS with less overhead for transmission and processing. All signing and verification operations occur on the server, so no client changes are required.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request

The code for this PR is for the 2.x branch but this feature is desired by customers (see ticket for more details) on the 1.x branch to assist in their migration from 1.x to 2.x. There would have to be some minor changes made to `SplitExcel` in order to include it on the 1.x branch.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request

can be mitigated in the following ways:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Reduce the maximum allowed length of the request headers using the\n[<code>--max-http-header-size=size</code>][] and/or the [<code>maxHeaderSize</code>][] options so\nthat no more headers than the <code>server.maxHeadersCount</code> limit can be sent.</li>\n</ol>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-13414](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-13414) Removes the `nifi-property-protection-api` and associated implementation modules as well as the `nifi-toolkit-encrypt-config` and `minifi-toolkit-encrypt-config` modules. These modules provided encryption and decryption capabilities for application properties in `nifi.properties` and similar configuration files in MiNiFi and NiFi Registry. These changes do not impact the behavior encryption and decryption for sensitive values in flow configuration components.\r\n\r\n[NIFI-1831](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-1831) Introduced initial support for application property encryption in NiFi 1.0.0, with acknowledged issues related to having the encryption key stored in a file next to the configuration properties themselves. Although subsequent versions of NiFi introduced support for externalized secrets management, integration with different service providers required large dependency trees and configuration that was specific to each provider. Although the implementation provided some abstraction between interface and implementation, the API was not considered a public extension point, and thus required significant and specialized internal maintenance.\r\n\r\nWith this background, changes for NIFI-13414 remove all references to local and service-based encryption for application properties. This avoids the inherent confusion related to encryption of properties in one file while having the plaintext key in another file in the same directory. Removing these capabilities across NiFi, NiFi Registry, and MiNiFi as part of version 2.0.0 serves to clear the source repository for potential new approaches that avoid the security and implementation concerns of the current approach.\r\n\r\nThese changes remove optional bootstrap configuration files and the `encrypt-config.sh` command from the NiFi Toolkit. The dependency removals reduce the size of the NiFi binary distribution by over 60 MB, removing over 130 JAR files from the `properties` library directory.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the

to avoid an extra flow file from being created\r\n\r\nThis PR is a proposal to see if the PMC agrees with this API change.\r\nI have not written any new unit tests for this PR yet until I get buy-in on it.\r\n\r\nI added two new create methods to the API of ProcessSession to allow the option of\r\npassing in ff attributes to be added to the flow file being created. This is not\r\na breaking change because the original create methods are still there.\r\n\r\nProcessSession\r\nFlowFile create(FlowFile parent, final Map<String, String> attributes);\r\nFlowFile create(final Map<String, String> attributes);\r\n\r\nChanging a core API is a very significant change but I hope people will see it\r\nas worthwhile to allow us to to avoid creating an extra FlowFile object in many\r\nplaces that FlowFiles are created. Not all places set attributes right after \\\r\nFF creation, but very many of them do and could benefit.\r\n\r\nThere are 150+ places where these new methods can be used and I only changed the\r\nGenerateTableFetch processor to call them so you how the new methods are used.\r\nI expect using these new create methods has the potential to\r\navoid noticeable transient memory allocation like the earlier API addition of\r\nSessionContext.isAutoTerminated did.\r\n\r\nAlso if this PR is approved, myself and others can change processors to call these\r\nnew methods in a future PRs (not as part of this PR).\r\n\r\n<!-- Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one or more -->\r\n<!-- contributor license agreements.

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-12125](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-12125) Refactors the [SSLContext](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/net/ssl/SSLContext.html) loading process for system framework components to streamline the process and support unified automatic reloading.\r\n\r\nNiFi 1.14.0 introduced support for configurable automatic reloading of security key store and trust store files for the Jetty web server. Subsequent versions refined support, but automatic reloading remained limited to Jetty web server. This pull request extends automatic reloading to apply to other framework uses of the security `SSLContext`, including cluster communication.\r\n\r\nThe changes include replacing XML-based Spring Framework configuration with Java-based Spring Framework for Flow Controller components. Instead of loading the configured key store and trust store files in different classes using methods from `SslContextFactory`, this pull request introduces a `FrameworkSslContextProvider` that is responsible for loading supporting components and making them available to both the Jetty Server and other Flow Controller components.\r\n\r\nThe Spring Framework configuration classes introduce new directory monitoring components that use the [WatchService](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/file/WatchService.html) to register for file change events. After detecting changes, the configured listener reloads key store and trust store files, then updates instances of `X509ExtendedKeyManager` and `X509ExtendedTrustManager`, which provide the security handling necessary for the shared instance of the `SSLContext`. The `StandardX509ExtendedKeyManager` and `StandardX509ExtendedTrustManager`classes include set methods that support changing the underlying reference object that performs to associated functions.\r\n\r\nThe changes enabled the removal of `SslContextFactory.fromNiFiProperties()` methods as well as the custom Jetty-specific `StoreScanner` class.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease

This PR dovetailed nicely with the work done in PR #8896 as there were many instances of concatenation of exception objects and or exception messages in log statements. The only concatenation left are logging statements whose statements are longer  than 200 characters  and those logging statements which have  streams to concatenate strings as part of  their arguments.\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [x] [Apache NiFi

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-13357](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-13357) Removes the `APP_INSTALLATION_TOKEN` Authentication option from the `GitHubFlowRegistryClient` in favor of the `APP_INSTALLATION` option implemented in \r\n[NIFI-13231](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-13231).\r\n\r\nThe `APP_INSTALLATION_TOKEN` option required external token provision to produce and sign a JWT with a short expiration, which was not optimal for long-lived access to GitHub repositories. The new `APP_INSTALLATION` option integrates App Installation Token provision using a configured App ID and Private Key, supporting long-lived service-based access. As the initial version was released in NiFi 2.0.0-M3, this is a breaking change, but the impact should be minimal based on the expiration issues with external token provisioning.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [X] [Apache NiFi Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI) issue created\r\n\r\n### Pull Request Tracking\r\n\r\n- [X] Pull Request title starts with Apache NiFi Jira issue number, such as `NIFI-00000`\r\n- [X] Pull Request commit message starts with Apache NiFi Jira issue number, as such `NIFI-00000`\r\n\r\n### Pull Request Formatting\r\n\r\n- [X] Pull Request based on current revision of the `main` branch\r\n- [X] Pull Request refers to a feature branch with one commit containing changes\r\n\r\n# Verification\r\n\r\nPlease indicate the verification steps performed prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Build\r\n\r\n- [X] Build completed using `mvn clean install -P contrib-check`\r\n  - [X] JDK 21\r\n\r\n### UI Contributions\r\n\r\n- [ ] NiFi is modernizing its UI.

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-13352](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-13352) Adjusts shutdown handling in the `ListenOTLP` Processor and associated test class to mitigate intermittent test failures related to socket connections.\r\n\r\nChanges include shortening the shutdown quiet period for the `ListenOTLP` `HttpServerFactory` to avoiding waiting 2 seconds before closing the listening socket, instead waiting 100 ms. Changes to the test class include calling `TestRunner.stop()` in an `AfterEach` method to proactively close listening sockets.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [X] [Apache NiFi Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI) issue created\r\n\r\n### Pull Request Tracking\r\n\r\n- [X] Pull Request title starts with Apache NiFi Jira issue number, such as `NIFI-00000`\r\n- [X] Pull Request commit message starts with Apache NiFi Jira issue number, as such `NIFI-00000`\r\n\r\n### Pull Request Formatting\r\n\r\n- [X] Pull Request based on current revision of the `main` branch\r\n- [X] Pull Request refers to a feature branch with one commit containing changes\r\n\r\n# Verification\r\n\r\nPlease indicate the verification steps performed prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Build\r\n\r\n- [ ] Build completed using `mvn clean install -P contrib-check`\r\n  - [ ] JDK 21\r\n\r\n### UI Contributions\r\n\r\n- [ ] NiFi is modernizing its UI.
