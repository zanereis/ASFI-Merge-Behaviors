am working on replacing Zipkin with SkyWalking's core in v3. However, while leveraging HTTPServer, I encountered some limitations. For instance, in Zipkin, we have [certain usages of ArmeriaServer configuration](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/blob/master/zipkin-server/src/main/java/zipkin2/server/internal/ui/ZipkinUiConfiguration.java#L94-L120), but SkyWalking's HTTPServer doesn't expose the `ArmeriaServerBuilder`, hindering deeper customizations. I propose making the `ServerBuilder` in HTTPServer protected to allow for extended functionalities in Zipkin.\r\n\r\n- [ ] If this pull request closes/resolves/fixes an existing issue, replace the issue number.

pull request introduces changes and improvements to the PHP Docker setup and configuration for SkyWalking agent integration:\r\n\r\n1. Docker Setup:\r\nUpdated to PHP 8.1-fpm-bullseye base image.\r\nIntroduced a builder stage to streamline the build process.\r\nInstalled Rust and its dependencies, a prerequisite for SkyWalking agent build.\r\nCloned and set the SkyWalking PHP repository to a specified commit.\r\nCompiled and installed the SkyWalking agent.\r\nUsed a multi-stage Docker build to improve the final image size and only carry necessary binaries.\r\n\r\n2. Docker Compose:\r\nModified image source to be built from the local context.\r\nAdded SW_AGENT_PHP_COMMIT as an argument to pass a specific commit of SkyWalking PHP agent.\r\nModified volume mounts for PHP configuration.\r\n\r\n3. Entry Point:\r\nIntroduced an entrypoint script for starting up services (Nginx and PHP-FPM).\r\n\r\n4. Nginx Configuration:\r\nAdded a basic Nginx configuration file to serve PHP applications and pass requests to PHP-FPM.\r\n\r\n5. PHP Configuration:\r\nUpdated the SkyWalking configuration section, segregating settings for general SkyWalking and SkyWalking agent configurations.\r\n\r\nAdjusted various settings for better integration with SkyWalking. These changes aim to streamline the PHP setup process, improve the integration with SkyWalking, and provide a more robust development and deployment experience. Feedback and reviews are highly appreciated.","created_at":"2023-09-14T07:01:49Z","updated_at":"2023-10-10T01:52:57Z","closed_at":"2023-10-10T01:52:57Z","merged_at":"2023-10-10T01:52:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"208a9ce55d43a6dfcd32c0f30ced3775d26510b4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":830850387,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MzA4NTAzODc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/labels/agent","name":"agent","color":"c2e0c6","default":false,"description":"Language

metadata, then both side can be analyzed in mx plugin or k8s IP mapping plugin, but if one side has metadata and the other side needs k8s IP mapping plugin, the latter will be skipped as the mx plugin already has part of the metrics, this patch will determine the upstream/downstream metrics are extracted or not, and fallback to the next plugin to extract the missing metrics.","created_at":"2023-08-25T09:52:55Z","updated_at":"2023-08-27T04:20:43Z","closed_at":"2023-08-27T04:20:36Z","merged_at":"2023-08-27T04:20:36Z","merge_commit_sha":"16f940b5ce411d1ccd8d50781b6d519c7b5feaa6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":830850453,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MzA4NTA0NTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/labels/backend","name":"backend","color":"54ceff","default":false,"description":"OAP
