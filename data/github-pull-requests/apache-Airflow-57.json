Description\r\n\r\nI've added a configuration option `require_confirmation_dag_change` to both the `config.yml` and the Flask App. Its default value is `False`. However, when a user sets this configuration to `True`, the Dag screen (`Dag.html`) will enforce a logic that requires users to confirm before they can Trigger a DAG or Pause/UnPause a Dag. \r\n\r\nThis feature is particularly effective for teams working across multiple environments, including sensitive ones like Production. \r\nNote: The confirmation is similar to the confirmation box displayed when deleting a Dag.\r\n\r\n# Related issue:\r\n- Resolve: #38284\r\n\r\n# Test

This was traced back to an operator with unusually long arguments and attributes.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\nI propose refining the operator's attribute inclusion logic in facets. Instead of excluding known unimportant or large attributes, we should selectively include only those known to be important or compact. This approach ensures that custom operator attributes with substantial data do not inflate the event size.\r\n\r\nI also deprecated two facets that contain duplicate information from AirflowRunFacet. We should probably remove them in the future.\r\n\r\nSimilar [PR](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/pull/2524) in `openlineage-airflow`\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes.

happened\r\n\r\nIn the Kubernetes executor, Merge Kubernetes Pod objects (base_worker_pod with 3 containers and 1 init container) is taking a significant amount of time (> 500 ms) due to the recursive deep copy.\r\n\r\nWhat you think should happen instead\r\n\r\nWe are constructing the base_worker_pod, dynamic_pod, and executor_config_pod for every task. So, we don't need to retain these pod objects. We can merge these pod objects in place and return the merged pod.\r\n\r\nI agree with fact that the immutability brings advantages. Even if we want to retain the pod objects, clone them before calling construct_pod/reconcile_pods function.\r\n\r\nClose: #37131

cache building workflow uses now smaller machines to build the cache - and if the ARM images are used to build CI and PROD images one after the other it exceeds the space available on those machines.\r\n\r\nThis PR implements a few optimizations to speed up cache building and related workflows:\r\n\r\nIt splits cache building to separate CI/PROD jobs - this way CI cache building does not need airflow/provider package preparation (saves a few minutes of build and space on the machine.\r\n\r\nAlso few related jobs could be easily run on public runners, rather than self-hosted runners, which would save the self-hosted runners for heavier load\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

left a little duplication of the code that has been used to build images in \"Build Images\" workflow - that is run as \"Pull request target\" workflow - mainly because of the security concerns and the way how we are replacing the source for actions, workflows and CI scripts from the incoming PRs with the one coming from the target branch.\r\n\r\nThis change moves parts of the code that was used to replace the scripts to the shared workflows and removes the composite actions that we used in the past as common code.\r\n\r\nAs part of that change it turned out that there was a bug in target-commit-sha usage for PRs coming from the forks where rather than using the merge commit, we were using the original commit coming from the fork. This was the reason why often we asked the users to rebase their PRs where some new breaking changes were added in the workflows or new dependencies added. With using merge commit, we should be experiencing the \"please rebase to take into account the latest version of CI or Airflow\" far less frequently.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

`breeze-python-version` has been used in a number of places where we wanted to make sure of reproducibility of prepared artifacts (because Python 3.8 produces different tar files).\r\n\r\nHowever that caused some problems with caching of breeze environments - where some of them were using Python 3.8 and some were using Python 3.9.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes it by:\r\n\r\n* making Python 3.9 default for all breeze installations in CI\r\n* removing the breeze-python-version parameter and all its usages from all workflows\r\n\r\nThe tests of breeze (ib basic-tests.yml) are still run with the default-python-version not with Python 3.9 (which currently is Python 3.8) - so the risk that breeze will not work on Python 3.8 is low.\r\n\r\nThis will also synchronize itself in October, when Python 3.8 will reach end-of-life and we will move to Python 3.9 as the default version.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license

excluded Python 3.12 from Databricks provider, because it was failing our Python 3.12 tests intermittently (but often enough to make a difference). It turned out that this was caused by running the tests with coverage enabled and PEP 669 implementation in Python 3.12 impacting intermittently performance of tests run with coverage. However seems that experimenetal PEP 669 support implemented in coverage 7.4.0 is nicely handling the performance issues and after #38194 we shoudl be able to enable Python 3.12 for Databricks without impacting our tests.\r\n\r\nRelated: https://github.com/databricks/databricks-sql-python/issues/369\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

running tests in parallel in our CI we switched off showing success outputs by default in #38157. This is generally a good thing, because it only shows outputs for the test types that failed and makes the CI log output far snappier in case only one or few test types failed.\r\n\r\nHowever it also has a side effect that it's\r\nnot really easy to see what kind of commands were run in each parallel test type, so we might get accidentally some mistakes where we miss that our tests are not doing what we think they are doing - for example not running tests for various Python versions, only for one, or not running them for various database versions (both cases happened in the past). By hiding the success outputs, we make it harder to spot such issues.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces two ways to improve it:\r\n\r\n* we can now set a label on PR to `include success outputs` and any committer can set the label to show success outputs as well.\r\n\r\n* When we run parallel unit tests we summarize what is going to be executed - showing all the ShellParams passed to the parallel test execution. This is the best place to show it because this ShellParams object contains all the actual values passed - after processing throught options, special environment variables and so-on - so those are the actual values used to run the parallel tests.\r\n\r\nAlso it will be printed in a prominent place - just before test execution in the main console output, which means it will be visible without the need to unfold any output.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

3.12 introduced a new (much faster) way of tracking and monitoring execution of python code by tools like coverage tracking using sysmon (PEP 669). This however also apparently heavily impacted performance of coverage tracking for Python 3.12 when PEP 669 is not used. The coverage library since 7.4.0 has an experimental support for PEP 669 that can be enabled with COVERAGE_CORE=sysmon env variable and a number of users confirmed it fixes the problem.\r\n\r\nWe are using 7.4.4 coverage already so we should enable this mode to speed up our coverage tracking. That should also allow us to remove databricks from excluded providers.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/databricks/databricks-sql-python/issues/369 for databricks case and https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1665 for coverage bug.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.
