Flake checks run in parallel and when you had an image which\r\nrequired rebuild, it performed additional check on whether the\r\nimage needs build or \"pull+build\". When it was run in parallel\r\na temporary file containing hash of the remote image could be\r\noverwritten and emptied while another process was reading it\r\nwhich resulted in error when running flake command.\r\n\r\nThis has been changed - the files are now stored in a temporary\r\nfiles - unique to each of the processes running in parallel and\r\nthe file in question is moved as an atomic operation so it will\r\nnever become empty.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

is one of the last final refactorings of the image before\r\nit is eligible to become an \"official image\".\r\n\r\nWhen you build dockerfiles locally for development the layer\r\ninvalidation could happen earlier than you wanted - some of the\r\nvariables (like COMMIT_SHA) were affecting the cache of Docker\r\nin the way that they forced either invalidation of the pre-cached\r\npackages installed or forced to recreate assets when they were\r\nnot touched.\r\n\r\nSimilarly when no webpack/yarn/packages/static are modified,\r\nthe node asset compilation should not happen. It makes\r\nno sense to compile all the assets on docker rebuild when\r\nnone of the www files changed.\r\n\r\nIn case of CI build we can also separate node modules\r\npreparation and asset compilation, because node modules\r\nshould remain in the image anyway for incremental changes.\r\n\r\nFixes: #20259\r\n\r\nThis PR improves the experience of iterating over docker image\r\nbuilding by decreasing unnecesary layer invalidations.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

However, because of the [task lifecycle](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/2.2.2/concepts/tasks.html#task-instances), the task state is never in `UP_FOR_RESCHEDULE` when task is executed at the next poke interval. \r\n\r\nThe scheduler updates the state for schedule-able tasks, which includes tasks with state `UP_FOR_RESCHEDULE`, to `SCHEDULED`. (see [source](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/9ac742885ffb83c15f7e3dc910b0cf9df073407a/airflow/models/dagrun.py#L884-L905)). This means that the original condition is never satisfied.\r\n\r\nInstead of checking task state, we can check if mode is reschedule with the reschedule attribute if present.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add

cases where task asks for more pool slots than the total number it has the scheduler generates the following warning:\r\n`[2021-12-09 19:37:51,949] {scheduler_job.py:407} INFO - Not executing <TaskInstance: a_pool.my_task scheduled__2021-12-09T19:08:00+00:0│172.18.0.10 [scheduled]> since it requires 4 slots but there are 2 open slots in the pool my_pool. ` \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/985bb06ba57ab67bb218ca9ca7549a81bea88f87/airflow/jobs/scheduler_job.py#L401-L408\r\n\r\nHowever this message is very confusing as the issue is not with open slots but with the total slots of the pool. Waiting for slots will not resolve the problem. To make the task run there must be an action from the user:\r\n\r\n1.  User to increase the total number of slots in the Pool\r\n2. User need to change the task code to requests less slots.\r\n\r\nThis PR add specific log notice for this case.\r\n\r\n**Testing:**\r\nAdded test to cover this case where pool is configured with 2 slots when task ask for 4 slots.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

This is the main prerequisite to make it possible for us to change the `log_filename_template` config’s default value.\r\n\r\nThis adds a new table `LogFilename`, and whenever an Airflow command is run (except those explicit set `check_db=False`), the user config value of `log_filename_template` is sync-ed into the table. Each `DagRun` gets a new `log_filename_id` foreign key (populated on creation) that can be used to look up what template they use to render task log filenames. All existing DagRun rows set this value to NULL (for performance reasons), and internally this makes them all use the first row in `LogFilename`, which should be the value in use when a user upgrades
