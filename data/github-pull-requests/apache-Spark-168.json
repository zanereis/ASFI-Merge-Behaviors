What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis reverts commit e6753c9402b5c40d9e2af662f28bd4f07a0bae17.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe `make_interval` function aims to construct values of the legacy interval type `CalendarIntervalType` which will be substituted by ANSI interval types (see SPARK-27790). Since the function has not been released yet, it would be better to don't expose it via public API at all.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nShould not since the `make_interval` function has not been released yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy existing test suites, and GA/jenkins builds.","created_at":"2021-06-29T19:58:00Z","updated_at":"2021-06-30T06:26:47Z","closed_at":"2021-06-30T06:26:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"95ce4c027d71fc92b66209bff1c4f550fd4987a1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33143/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33143/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33143/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/33b5b9afd32d50e04a1dea3719f86ed166c5e90c","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:revert-make_interval","ref":"revert-make_interval","sha":"33b5b9afd32d50e04a1dea3719f86ed166c5e90c","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nChanges in this PR:\r\n\r\n- `AdaptiveSparkPlanExec` has new methods `finalPlanSupportsColumnar` and `doExecuteColumnar` to support adaptive queries where the final query stage produces columnar data.\r\n- `SessionState` now has a new set of injectable rules named `finalQueryStagePrepRules` that can be applied to the final query stage.\r\n- `AdaptiveSparkPlanExec` can now safely be wrapped by either `RowToColumnarExec` or `ColumnarToRowExec`.\r\n\r\nA Spark plugin can use the new rules to remove the root `ColumnarToRowExec` transition that is inserted by previous rules and at execution time can call `finalPlanSupportsColumnar` to see if the final query stage is columnar. If the plan is columnar then the plugin can safely call `doExecuteColumnar`. The adaptive plan can be wrapped in either `RowToColumnarExec` or `ColumnarToRowExec` to force a particular output format. There are fast paths in both of these operators to avoid any redundant transitions.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWithout this change it is necessary to use reflection to get the final physical plan to determine whether it is columnar and to execute it is a columnar plan. `AdaptiveSparkPlanExec` only provides public methods for row-based execution.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nI have manually tested this patch with the RAPIDS Accelerator for Apache Spark.\r\n","created_at":"2021-06-29T18:41:21Z","updated_at":"2021-07-30T20:56:15Z","closed_at":"2021-07-30T18:22:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"71a93dac2249295f5a60a107058c6000b41fcbf2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33140/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33140/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33140/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0988acdafd41581cd02baa4b339497e6e54e7015","head":{"label":"andygrove:support-columnar-adaptive","ref":"support-columnar-adaptive","sha":"0988acdafd41581cd02baa4b339497e6e54e7015","user":{"login":"andygrove","id":934084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkzNDA4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/934084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove","html_url":"https://github.com/andygrove","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":205463461,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDU0NjM0NjE=","name":"spark","full_name":"andygrove/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"andygrove","id":934084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkzNDA4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/934084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove","html_url":"https://github.com/andygrove","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andygrove/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/andygrove/spark","description":"Apache

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdd a new ANSI type coercion rule: when getting a date field from a Timestamp column, cast the column as Date type.\r\n\r\nThis is Spark's current hack to make the implementation simple. In the default type coercion rules, the implicit cast rule does the work. However, The ANSI implicit cast rule doesn't allow converting Timestamp type as Date type, so we need to have this additional rule to make sure the date field extraction from Timestamp columns works.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to catch all non-fatal exceptions coming `refreshTable()` at the final stage of table repairing, and output an error message instead of failing with an exception.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. The uncaught exceptions from table refreshing might be considered as regression comparing to previous Spark versions. Table refreshing was introduced by https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/31066.\r\n2. This should improve user experience with Spark SQL. For instance, when the `MSCK REPAIR TABLE` is performed in a chain of command in SQL where catching exception is difficult or even impossible.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. Before the changes the `MSCK REPAIR TABLE` command can fail with the exception portrayed in SPARK-35935. After the changes, the same command outputs error message, and completes successfully.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy existing test suites.","created_at":"2021-06-29T16:48:21Z","updated_at":"2021-06-30T10:34:08Z","closed_at":"2021-06-30T06:45:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"dab5fc4548023f8e4db018345de1ab8275a89dfe","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33137/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33137/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33137/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/85954aef15ec30a14c4b4ec762d32b85d69bd133","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:msck-repair-catch-except","ref":"msck-repair-catch-except","sha":"85954aef15ec30a14c4b4ec762d32b85d69bd133","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n- This PR allows to add a custom implementation of YARN_CLUSTER_SUBMIT_CLASS as a configuration.\r\n-  This is useful when there is a custom variant of Yarn cluster running which requires a modified Yarn client.\r\n- Users can implement a class similar to YarnClusterApplication which can invoke a custom Yarn client. Users should add the relevant dependencies in the classpath.\r\n- Default value of the configuration is set to the current class: org.apache.spark.deploy.yarn.YarnClusterApplication.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis is required when there is a custom variant of Yarn cluster running which requires a modified Yarn client. For example, there may be different handling of credentials required in a custom Yarn cluster.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, this PR introduces a new configuration key but the behaviour is unchanged without explicitly modifying the config. Documentation is added for the new configuration.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTested following in a local Yarn cluster: \r\nTested without the config added - Existing client is used to submit application\r\nTested with config added - New client is used to submit application\r\nTested with config added but class not present - Spark-submit throws error:  Could not load YARN classes.\r\n\r\nUnit tests:\r\nAdded unit tests when the configuration is enabled.\r\nExisting unit tests which validate the current YarnClusterApplication class name are passing.","created_at":"2021-06-29T14:58:07Z","updated_at":"2021-10-17T00:10:19Z","closed_at":"2021-10-17T00:10:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e0679985d0ab2df6ac613e7d8eb70fac2699a0c2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33135/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33135/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33135/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/80f6fe2f6de16cef706bcb4ea2f9233131c5e767","head":{"label":"akshatb1:master","ref":"master","sha":"80f6fe2f6de16cef706bcb4ea2f9233131c5e767","user":{"login":"akshatb1","id":31816865,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODE2ODY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31816865?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshatb1","html_url":"https://github.com/akshatb1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshatb1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshatb1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshatb1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshatb1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshatb1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshatb1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshatb1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshatb1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshatb1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":378942759,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzg5NDI3NTk=","name":"spark","full_name":"akshatb1/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"akshatb1","id":31816865,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODE2ODY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31816865?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshatb1","html_url":"https://github.com/akshatb1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshatb1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshatb1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshatb1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshatb1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshatb1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshatb1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshatb1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshatb1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshatb1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/akshatb1/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n- This PR allows to add a custom implementation of YARN_CLUSTER_SUBMIT_CLASS as a configuration.\r\n-  This is useful when there is a custom variant of Yarn cluster running which requires a modified Yarn client.\r\n- Users can implement a class similar to YarnClusterApplication which can invoke a custom Yarn client. Users should add the relevant dependencies in the classpath.\r\n- Default value of the configuration is set to the current class: org.apache.spark.deploy.yarn.YarnClusterApplication.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis is required when there is a custom variant of Yarn cluster running which requires a modified Yarn client. For example, there may be different handling of credentials required in a custom Yarn cluster.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, this PR introduces a new configuration key but the behaviour is unchanged without explicitly modifying the config. Documentation is added for the new configuration.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTested following in a local Yarn cluster: \r\nTested without the config added - Existing client is used to submit application\r\nTested with config added - New client is used to submit application\r\nTested with config added but class not present - Spark-submit throws error:  Could not load YARN classes.\r\n\r\nUnit tests:\r\nAdded unit tests when the configuration is enabled.\r\nExisting unit tests which validate the current YarnClusterApplication class name are passing.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-06-29T14:31:10Z","updated_at":"2021-06-29T14:56:56Z","closed_at":"2021-06-29T14:56:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6bdb220bcfe579c2a07a46da97f345a926e289a4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33134/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33134/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33134/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/80f6fe2f6de16cef706bcb4ea2f9233131c5e767","head":{"label":"akshatb1:master","ref":"master","sha":"80f6fe2f6de16cef706bcb4ea2f9233131c5e767","user":{"login":"akshatb1","id":31816865,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODE2ODY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31816865?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshatb1","html_url":"https://github.com/akshatb1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshatb1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshatb1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshatb1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshatb1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshatb1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshatb1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshatb1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshatb1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshatb1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":378942759,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzg5NDI3NTk=","name":"spark","full_name":"akshatb1/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"akshatb1","id":31816865,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODE2ODY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31816865?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshatb1","html_url":"https://github.com/akshatb1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshatb1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshatb1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshatb1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshatb1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshatb1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshatb1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshatb1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshatb1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akshatb1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/akshatb1/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSupport width_bucket(YearMonthIntervalType, YearMonthIntervalType, YearMonthIntervalType, Long), it return long result\r\n eg:\r\n```\r\nwidth_bucket(input_value, min_value, max_value, bucket_nums)\r\nwidth_bucket(INTERVAL '1' YEAR, INTERVAL '0' YEAR, INTERVAL '10' YEAR, 10)\r\nIt will divides the range between the max_value and min_value into 10 buckets.\r\n[ INTERVAL '0' YEAR,  INTERVAL '1' YEAR),  [ INTERVAL '1' YEAR,  INTERVAL '2' YEAR)......  [INTERVAL '9' YEAR,  INTERVAL '10' YEAR)\r\nThen, calculates which bucket the given input_value locate.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe function `width_bucket` is introduced from [SPARK-21117](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-21117)\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n[35926](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-35926)\r\n1. The `WIDTH_BUCKET` function assigns values to buckets (individual segments) in an equiwidth histogram. The ANSI SQL Standard Syntax is like follow: `WIDTH_BUCKET( expression, min, max, buckets)`. [Reference](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/sql-in-a/9780596155322/re91.html). \r\n2. `WIDTH_BUCKET` just support `Double` at now, Of course, we can cast `Int` to `Double` to use it. But we cloud not cast `YearMonthIntervayType` to `Double`. \r\n3. I think it has a use scenario. eg:  Histogram of employee years of service, the `years of service` is a column of `YearMonthIntervalType` dataType.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. The user can use `width_bucket` with YearMonthIntervalType.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd ut

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nReplace the type collection `AllTimestampTypes` with the new data type `AnyTimestampType`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAs discussed in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/33115#discussion_r659866760, it is more convenient to have a new data type \"AnyTimestampType\" instead of using type collection `AllTimestampTypes`:\r\n1. simplify the pattern match\r\n2. In the default type coercion rules, when implicit casting a type to a TypeCollection type, Spark chooses the first convertible data type as the result. If we are going to make the default timestamp type configurable, having AnyTimestampType is better\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nExisting

For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nSince [SPARK-35447](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-35447), we apply `OptimizeSkewedJoin` before `CoalesceShufflePartitions`. However, There are something different with the order of these two rules.\r\n\r\nLet's say if we have a skewed partitions: [0, 128MB, 0, 128MB, 0]:\r\n\r\n* coalesce partitions first then optimize skewed partitions:\r\n  [64MB, 64MB, 64MB, 64MB]\r\n* optimize skewed partition first then coalesce partitions:\r\n  [0, 64MB, 64MB, 0, 64MB, 64MB, 0]\r\n\r\nSo we can do coalesce in `ShufflePartitionsUtil.coalescePartitionsWithSkew` with mixed `CoalescedPartitionSpec` and `PartialReducerPartitionSpec` if `CoalescedPartitionSpec` is empty.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo, not release yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdd test.","created_at":"2021-06-29T04:52:34Z","updated_at":"2021-06-30T01:14:21Z","closed_at":"2021-06-29T14:59:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0946de12731d69e91ab7ac6effa624cf456a1828","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33123/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33123/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33123/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ed4e07f85655443f800b20995fbf6237cd719552","head":{"label":"ulysses-you:SPARK-35923","ref":"SPARK-35923","sha":"ed4e07f85655443f800b20995fbf6237cd719552","user":{"login":"ulysses-you","id":12025282,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDI1Mjgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12025282?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you","html_url":"https://github.com/ulysses-you","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":195747855,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTU3NDc4NTU=","name":"spark","full_name":"ulysses-you/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ulysses-you","id":12025282,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDI1Mjgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12025282?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you","html_url":"https://github.com/ulysses-you","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulysses-you/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ulysses-you/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR changes `SparkBuild.scala` to edit `config.properties` in `yarn` sub-module in build with SBT like as build with Maven does.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nyarn sub-module contains config.properties.\r\n```\r\nspark.yarn.isHadoopProvided = ${spark.yarn.isHadoopProvided}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `${spark.yarn.isHadoopProvided}` part is replaced with `true` or `false` in build depending on whether Hadoop is provided or not (specified by -Phadoop-provided).\r\nThe edited config.properties will be loaded at runtime to control how to populate Hadoop-related classpath.\r\n\r\nIf we build with Maven, these process works but doesn't with SBT.\r\n\r\nIf we build with SBT and deploy apps on YARN, the following warning appears and classpath is not populated correctly.\r\n```\r\n21/06/29 10:51:20 WARN config.package: Can not load the default value of `spark.yarn.isHadoopProvided` from `org/apache/spark/deploy/yarn/config.properties` with error, java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: For input string: \"${spark.yarn.isHadoopProvided}\". Using `false` as a default value.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nBuilt with SBT and extracted `config.properties` from the build artifact and confirmed `${spark.yarn.isHadoopProvided} was correctly edited with `true` or `false`.\r\n```\r\ncat org/apache/spark/deploy/yarn/config.properties \r\nspark.yarn.isHadoopProvided = false                                # In case build with -Pyarn and

above no longer

is WIP because https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/33118#issuecomment-870084009\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nPush-based shuffle is partially merged in apache master but some of the tasks are still incomplete. Since 3.2 is going to cut soon, we will not be able to get the pending tasks reviewed and merged. Few of the pending tasks make protocol changes to the push-based shuffle protocols, so we would like to prevent users from enabling push-based shuffle both on the client and the server until push-based shuffle implementation is complete. \r\nWe can prevent push-based shuffle to be used by throwing UnsupportedOperationException both on the client and the server when the user tries to enable it.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe change is needed to prevent users from trying out push-based shuffle until it is complete.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. It will prevent users to try out push-based shuffle until it is complete.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nIt is a straightforward change that prevents users from enable push-based shuffle so

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n`ExternalBlockHandler` exposes 4 metrics which are Dropwizard `Timer` metrics, and are named with a `millis` suffix:\r\n```\r\n    private final Timer openBlockRequestLatencyMillis = new Timer();\r\n    private final Timer registerExecutorRequestLatencyMillis = new Timer();\r\n    private final Timer fetchMergedBlocksMetaLatencyMillis = new Timer();\r\n    private final Timer finalizeShuffleMergeLatencyMillis = new Timer();\r\n```\r\nHowever these Dropwizard Timers by default use nanoseconds ([documentation](https://metrics.dropwizard.io/3.2.3/getting-started.html#timers)).\r\n\r\nThis causes `YarnShuffleServiceMetrics` to expose confusingly-named metrics like `openBlockRequestLatencyMillis_nanos_max` (the actual values are currently in nanos).\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new `Timer` subclass, `TimerWithCustomTimeUnit`, which accepts a `TimeUnit` at creation time and exposes timing information using this time unit when values are read. Internally, values are still stored with nanosecond-level precision. The `Timer` metrics within `ExternalBlockHandler` are updated to use the new class with milliseconds as the unit. The logic to include the `nanos` suffix in the metric name within `YarnShuffleServiceMetrics` has also been removed, with the assumption that the metric name itself includes the units.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, there are two changes.\r\nFirst, the names for metrics exposed by `ExternalBlockHandler` via `YarnShuffleServiceMetrics` such as `openBlockRequestLatencyMillis_nanos_max` and `openBlockRequestLatencyMillis_nanos_50thPercentile` have been changed to remove the `_nanos` suffix. This would be considered a breaking change, but these names were only exposed as part of #32388, which has not yet been released (slated for 3.2.0). New names are like `openBlockRequestLatencyMillis_max` and `openBlockRequestLatencyMillis_50thPercentile`\r\nSecond, the values of the metrics themselves have changed, to expose milliseconds instead of nanoseconds. Note that this does not affect metrics such as `openBlockRequestLatencyMillis_count` or `openBlockRequestLatencyMillis_rate1`, only the `Snapshot`-related metrics (`max`, `median`, percentiles, etc.). For the YARN case, these metrics were also introduced by #32388, and thus also have not yet been released. It was possible for the nanosecond values to be consumed by some other metrics reporter reading the Dropwizard metrics directly, but I'm not aware of any such usages.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests have been updated.","created_at":"2021-06-28T18:39:49Z","updated_at":"2021-07-26T16:03:15Z","closed_at":"2021-07-24T13:26:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a7ad78e31c771e93ad2c0407eec79c0041469067","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1427970157,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDI3OTcwMTU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/YARN","name":"YARN","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33116/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33116/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33116/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d62dd57a1fec572209e0fa69d53a3eea8b5ffe6f","head":{"label":"xkrogen:xkrogen-SPARK-35259-ess-fix-metric-unit-prefix","ref":"xkrogen-SPARK-35259-ess-fix-metric-unit-prefix","sha":"d62dd57a1fec572209e0fa69d53a3eea8b5ffe6f","user":{"login":"xkrogen","id":6570401,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NzA0MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6570401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen","html_url":"https://github.com/xkrogen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":273605257,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzM2MDUyNTc=","name":"spark","full_name":"xkrogen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xkrogen","id":6570401,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NzA0MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6570401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen","html_url":"https://github.com/xkrogen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xkrogen/spark","description":"Apache

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR proposes to migrate the following `ALTER TABLE ... CHANGE COLUMN` command to use `UnresolvedTable` as a `child` to resolve the table identifier. This allows consistent resolution rules (temp view first, etc.) to be applied for both v1/v2 commands. More info about the consistent resolution rule proposal can be found in [JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-29900) or [proposal doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hvLjGA8y_W_hhilpngXVub1Ebv8RsMap986nENCFnrg/edit?usp=sharing).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis is a part of effort to make the relation lookup behavior consistent: [SPARK-29900](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-29900).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nAfter this PR, the above `ALTER TABLE ... CHANGE COLUMN` commands will have a consistent resolution behavior.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nUpdated existing tests.\r\n","created_at":"2021-06-28T03:54:21Z","updated_at":"2021-07-05T08:07:36Z","closed_at":"2021-06-29T02:53:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"621cbcf500dc898d7bf7271940d203ed19163add","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33113/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33113/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33113/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6a75c920df97a13ac547056eb7eb286b3accf973","head":{"label":"imback82:alter_change_column","ref":"alter_change_column","sha":"6a75c920df97a13ac547056eb7eb286b3accf973","user":{"login":"imback82","id":12103644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTAzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12103644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82","html_url":"https://github.com/imback82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":190453549,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTA0NTM1NDk=","name":"spark-4","full_name":"imback82/spark-4","private":false,"owner":{"login":"imback82","id":12103644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTAzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12103644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82","html_url":"https://github.com/imback82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/imback82/spark-4","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes `PromotePrecision` where it overwrites `genCode` where subexpression elimination should happen. This is the backport of SPARK-35886 to branch-3.0.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n`PromotePrecision` overwrites `genCode` where subexpression elimination should happen. So if it is most top expression of a subexpression, it is never replaced.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded test.","created_at":"2021-06-27T19:12:45Z","updated_at":"2021-06-27T23:52:15Z","closed_at":"2021-06-27T22:43:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"261d15108af70eb0aad1b1008e90f79d56064ed0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33112/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33112/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33112/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0deaba2931cb78dda246e4deb8999e31e510048f","head":{"label":"viirya:fix-precision-3.0","ref":"fix-precision-3.0","sha":"0deaba2931cb78dda246e4deb8999e31e510048f","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes `PromotePrecision` where it overwrites `genCode` where subexpression elimination should happen. This is the backport of SPARK-35886 to branch-3.1.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n`PromotePrecision` overwrites `genCode` where subexpression elimination should happen. So if it is most top expression of a subexpression, it is never replaced.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded test.","created_at":"2021-06-27T19:10:49Z","updated_at":"2021-06-27T23:51:56Z","closed_at":"2021-06-27T22:42:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d21f41b53089abedf866917388e8733826ce2a4b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33111/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33111/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33111/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/fd8fd87216a96f5ca1763063e23c6ce365d5ca9d","head":{"label":"viirya:fix-precision-3.1","ref":"fix-precision-3.1","sha":"fd8fd87216a96f5ca1763063e23c6ce365d5ca9d","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently, we calculate the `remoteBlockBytes` based on the original block info list. It's not efficient. Usually, it costs more ~25% time to be spent here.\r\n\r\nIf the original reducer size is big but the actual reducer size is small due to automatically partition coalescing of AQE, the reducer will take more time to calculate `remoteBlockBytes`.\r\n\r\nWe can reduce this cost via remote requests which contain merged block info lists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nimprove task performance \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nnew unit tests and verified

In particular this PR fixes two bugs:\r\n\r\n1. `appendArray` in `WritableColumnVector` does not reserve any elements in its child arrays, which causes the assertion in `OffHeapColumnVector.putArray` to fail.\r\n2. The nullability of the child columns is propagated incorrectly when creating the child converters of `ArrayConverter` and `MapConverter` in `RowToColumnConverter`.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes these issues.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nBoth bugs cause an exception to be thrown.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nI added additional test cases to `ColumnVectorSuite` to catch the first bug, and I added `RowToColumnConverterSuite` to catch the both bugs (but specifically the second).\r\n","created_at":"2021-06-27T11:01:12Z","updated_at":"2021-06-29T03:00:10Z","closed_at":"2021-06-28T14:51:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bfdf24fe148c59144ec781809b59e6652646cb93","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33108/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33108/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33108/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/380b1d07f17c076ef3a90a4d12282ba79b9612e9","head":{"label":"tomvanbussel:SPARK-35898","ref":"SPARK-35898","sha":"380b1d07f17c076ef3a90a4d12282ba79b9612e9","user":{"login":"tomvanbussel","id":46442880,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NDQyODgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46442880?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel","html_url":"https://github.com/tomvanbussel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":174318680,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzQzMTg2ODA=","name":"spark","full_name":"tomvanbussel/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tomvanbussel","id":46442880,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NDQyODgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46442880?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel","html_url":"https://github.com/tomvanbussel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomvanbussel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tomvanbussel/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe code of method: createDirectory in class: org.apache.spark.util.Utils is modified.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo solve the problem of ambiguous exception handling in traditional IO creating directories.\r\n\r\nWhat's more, there shouldn't be an improper comment in Spark's source code.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\nThe modified method would be called to create the working directory when Worker starts.\r\n\r\nThe modified method would be called to create local

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a utility to convert public connector expressions to Catalyst expressions.\r\n\r\nNotable differences:\r\n- Switched to `QueryCompilationErrors` from an explicit `AnalysisException`.\r\n- Decoupled the resolving logic for v2 references into separate methods to use in other places.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThese changes are needed as more and more places require this logic and it is better to implement it in a single place.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nExisting tests.","created_at":"2021-06-25T23:27:45Z","updated_at":"2021-06-29T02:02:58Z","closed_at":"2021-06-26T01:04:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4eeeaba8fc52948e2955a247329bb0e7c91e11ae","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33096/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33096/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33096/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3ac51da333f0400264081a3425e332646282c3a9","head":{"label":"aokolnychyi:spark-35899","ref":"spark-35899","sha":"3ac51da333f0400264081a3425e332646282c3a9","user":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":61945043,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MTk0NTA0Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"aokolnychyi/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi/spark","description":"Mirror

For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe main motivation is find hotspots and have better visibility in the stateful operations. Detailed explanations are in [SPARK-35896](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-35896).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. The `StateOperatorProgress` entries within `StreamingQueryProgress` now contain additional fields as listed in [SPARK-35896](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-35896).

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nRefactor the logic for constructing the user classpath from `yarn.ApplicationMaster` into `yarn.Client` so that it can be leveraged on the executor side as well, instead of having the driver construct it and pass it to the executor via command-line arguments. A new method, `getUserClassPath`, is added to `CoarseGrainedExecutorBackend` which defaults to `Nil` (consistent with the existing behavior where non-YARN resource managers do not configure the user classpath). `YarnCoarseGrainedExecutorBackend` overrides this to construct the user classpath from the existing `APP_JAR` and `SECONDARY_JARS` configs.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nUser-provided JARs are made available to executors using a custom classloader, so they do not appear on the standard Java classpath. Instead, they are passed as a list to the executor which then creates a classloader out of the URLs. Currently in the case of YARN, this list of JARs is crafted by the Driver (in `ExecutorRunnable`), which then passes the information to the executors (`CoarseGrainedExecutorBackend`) by specifying each JAR on the executor command line as `--user-class-path /path/to/myjar.jar`. This can cause extremely long argument lists when there are many JARs, which can cause the OS argument length to be exceeded, typically manifesting as the error message:\r\n\r\n> /bin/bash: Argument list too long\r\n\r\nA [Google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=spark%20%22%2Fbin%2Fbash%3A%20argument%20list%20too%20long%22&oq=spark%20%22%2Fbin%2Fbash%3A%20argument%20list%20too%20long%22) indicates that this is not a theoretical problem and afflicts real users, including ours. Passing this list using the configurations instead resolves this issue.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, except for fixing the bug, allowing for larger JAR lists to be passed successfully. Configuration of JARs is identical to before.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew unit tests were added in `YarnClusterSuite`. Also, we have been running a similar fix internally for 4 months with great success.\r\n\r\nNote that this is a backport of #32810 with minor conflicts around

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nUpdate Ivy from 2.4.0 to 2.5.0. \r\n\r\n- https://ant.apache.org/ivy/history/2.5.0/release-notes.html\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis brings various improvements and bug fixes. Most notably, the adding of `ivy.maven.lookup.sources` and `ivy.maven.lookup.javadoc` configs can significantly speed up module resolution time if these are turned off, especially behind a proxy. These could arguably be turned off by default, because when submitting jobs you probably don't care about the sources or javadoc jars. I didn't include that here but happy to look into if it's desired.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nExisting UT and build

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to add a new scalastyle rule to enforce not importing `scala.collection.Seq` and `scala.collection.IndexedSeq` which conflicts with `scala.Seq` and `scala.IndexedSeq`.\r\n\r\nThe problem occurs as Scala 2.13 changed the alias of `scala.Seq` and `scala.IndexedSeq`. Before Scala 2.13, they were `scala.collection.Seq` and `scala.collection.IndexedSeq`. After Scala 2.13, they become `scala.collection.immutable.Seq` and `scala.collection.immutable.IndexedSeq`.\r\n\r\nPlease refer below doc for more details.\r\nhttps://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/core/collections-migration-213.html\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWe have seen Seq/IndexedSeq issues on cross-compilation of Scala 2.12 / 2.13. While I'm not sure this can prevent all cases, this will prevent the simple case of breaking cross compilation.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo change on end user. Contributors will be restricted but shouldn't block them doing the right thing.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nRan scalastyle against current master (before #33084)\r\n\r\n```\r\n>

this PR is the last part of SPARK-10816 (EventTime based sessionization (session window)). Please refer #31937 to see the overall view of the code change. (Note that code diff could be diverged a bit.)\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to support native session window. Please refer the comments/design doc in SPARK-10816 for more details on the rationalization and design (could be outdated a bit compared to the PR).\r\n\r\nThe definition of the boundary of \"session window\" is [the timestamp of start event ~ the timestamp of last event + gap duration). That said, unlike time window, session window is a dynamic window which can expand if new input row is added to the session. To handle expansion of session window, Spark defines session window per input row, and \"merge\" windows if they can be merged (boundaries are overlapped).\r\n\r\nThis PR leverages two different approaches on merging session windows:\r\n\r\n1. merging session windows with Spark's aggregation logic (a variant of sort aggregation)\r\n2. updating session window for all rows bound to the same session, and applying aggregation logic afterwards\r\n\r\nFirst one is preferable as it outperforms compared to the second one, though it can be only used if merging session window can be applied altogether with aggregation. It is not applicable on all the cases, so second one is used to cover the remaining cases.\r\n\r\nThis PR also applies the optimization on merging input rows and existing sessions with retaining the order (group keys + start timestamp of session window), leveraging the fact the number of existing sessions per group key won't be huge.\r\n\r\nThe state format is versioned, so that we can bring a new state format if we find a better one.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFor now, to deal with sessionization, Spark requires end users to play with (flat)MapGroupsWithState directly which has a couple of major drawbacks:\r\n\r\n1. (flat)MapGroupsWithState is lower level API and end users have to code everything in details for defining session window and merging windows\r\n2. built-in aggregate functions cannot be used and end users have to deal with aggregation by themselves\r\n3. (flat)MapGroupsWithState is only available in Scala/Java.\r\n\r\nWith native support of session window, end users simply use \"session_window\" like they use \"window\" for tumbling/sliding window, and leverage built-in aggregate functions as well as UDAFs to simply define aggregations.\r\n\r\nQuoting the query example from test suite:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    val inputData = MemoryStream[(String, Long)]\r\n\r\n    // Split the lines into words, treat words as sessionId of events\r\n    val events = inputData.toDF()\r\n      .select($\"_1\".as(\"value\"), $\"_2\".as(\"timestamp\"))\r\n      .withColumn(\"eventTime\", $\"timestamp\".cast(\"timestamp\"))\r\n      .selectExpr(\"explode(split(value, ' ')) AS sessionId\", \"eventTime\")\r\n      .withWatermark(\"eventTime\", \"30 seconds\")\r\n\r\n    val sessionUpdates = events\r\n      .groupBy(session_window($\"eventTime\", \"10 seconds\") as 'session, 'sessionId)\r\n      .agg(count(\"*\").as(\"numEvents\"))\r\n      .selectExpr(\"sessionId\", \"CAST(session.start AS LONG)\", \"CAST(session.end AS LONG)\",\r\n        \"CAST(session.end AS LONG) - CAST(session.start AS LONG) AS durationMs\",\r\n        \"numEvents\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich is same as StructuredSessionization (native session window is shorter and clearer even ignoring model classes).\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/39542bb81f8570219770bb6533c077f44f6cbd2a/examples/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/examples/sql/streaming/StructuredSessionization.scala#L66-L105 \r\n\r\n(Worth noting that the code in StructuredSessionization only works with processing time. The code doesn't consider old event can update the start time of old session.)\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. This PR brings the new feature to support session window on both batch and streaming query, which adds a new function \"session_window\" which usage is similar with \"window\".\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew test suites. Also tested with benchmark code.","created_at":"2021-06-25T08:29:51Z","updated_at":"2021-07-16T16:09:24Z","closed_at":"2021-07-16T11:38:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"acc4a4418c35cee02c39a78aaaf4e8f5b05f7df4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n* add `dataSize` field in `CoalescedPartitionSpec`\r\n* add data size test suite in `ShufflePartitionsUtilSuite`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently, all test suite about `CoalescedPartitionSpec` do not check the data size due to it doesn't contains data size field.\r\n\r\nWe can add data size in `CoalescedPartitionSpec` and then add test case for better coverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nPass

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis is one of the patches for SPIP SPARK-30602 which is needed for push-based shuffle.\r\n\r\n### Summary of the change:\r\nWhen Executor registers with Shuffle Service, it will encode the merged shuffle dir created and also the application attemptId into the ShuffleManagerMeta into Json. Then in Shuffle Service, it will decode the Json string and get the correct merged shuffle dir and also the attemptId. If the registration comes from a newer attempt, the merged shuffle information will be updated to store the information from the newer attempt.\r\n\r\nThis PR also refactored the management of the merged shuffle information to avoid concurrency issues.\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nRefer to the SPIP in SPARK-30602.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded unit tests.\r\nThe reference PR with the consolidated changes covering the complete implementation is also provided in SPARK-30602.\r\nWe have already verified the functionality and the improved performance as documented in the SPIP

this PR is a part of SPARK-10816 (EventTime based sessionization (session window)). Please refer #31937 to see the overall view of the code change. (Note that code diff could be diverged a bit.)\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces MergingSortWithSessionWindowStateIterator, which does \"merge sort\" between input rows and sessions in state based on group key and session's start time. \r\n\r\nNote that the iterator does merge sort among input rows and sessions grouped by grouping key. The iterator doesn't provide sessions in state which keys don't exist in input rows. For input rows, the iterator will provide all rows regardless of the existence of matching sessions in state.\r\n\r\nMergingSortWithSessionWindowStateIterator works on the precondition that given iterator is sorted by \"group keys + start time of session window\", and the iterator still retains the characteristic of the sort.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis part is a one of required on implementing SPARK-10816.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew UT added.","created_at":"2021-06-25T05:48:54Z","updated_at":"2021-07-14T11:50:09Z","closed_at":"2021-07-14T09:47:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a7ce0f810e6ce0924ef64cfed457809728d667e8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a backport of #32969.\r\n\r\nWhen creating a record writer in an AvroDeserializer, or creating a struct converter in an AvroSerializer, look up Avro fields using a map rather than scanning the entire list of Avro fields.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nA query against an Avro table can be quite slow when all are true:\r\n\r\n* There are many columns in the Avro file\r\n* The query contains a wide projection\r\n* There are many splits in the input\r\n* Some of the splits are read serially (e.g., less executors than there are tasks)\r\n\r\nA write to an Avro table can be quite slow when all are true:\r\n\r\n* There are many columns in the new rows\r\n* The operation is creating many files\r\n\r\nFor example, a single-threaded query against a 6000 column Avro data set with 50K rows and 20 files takes less than a minute with Spark 3.0.1 but over 7 minutes with Spark 3.2.0-SNAPSHOT.\r\n\r\nThis PR restores

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR modifies `DecorrelateInnerQuery` to handle the COUNT bug for lateral subqueries. Similar to SPARK-15370, rewriting lateral subqueries as joins can change the semantics of the subquery and lead to incorrect answers. \r\n\r\nHowever we can't reuse the existing code to handle the count bug for correlated scalar subqueries because it assumes the subquery to have a specific shape (either with Filter + Aggregate or Aggregate as the root node). Instead, this PR proposes a more generic way to handle the COUNT bug. If an Aggregate is subject to the COUNT bug, we insert a left outer domain join between the outer query and the aggregate with a `alwaysTrue` marker and rewrite the final result conditioning on the marker. For example:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\n-- t1: [(0, 1), (1, 2)]\r\n-- t2: [(0, 2), (0, 3)]\r\nselect * from t1 left outer join lateral (select count(*) from t2 where t2.c1 = t1.c1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWithout count bug handling, the query plan is\r\n```\r\nProject [c1#44, c2#45, count(1)#53L]\r\n+- Join LeftOuter, (c1#48 = c1#44)\r\n   :- LocalRelation [c1#44, c2#45]\r\n   +- Aggregate [c1#48], [count(1) AS count(1)#53L, c1#48]\r\n      +- LocalRelation [c1#48]\r\n```\r\nand the answer is wrong: \r\n```\r\n+---+---+--------+\r\n|c1 |c2 |count(1)|\r\n+---+---+--------+\r\n|0  |1  |2       |\r\n|1  |2  |null    |\r\n+---+---+--------+\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith the count bug handling:\r\n```\r\nProject [c1#1, c2#2, count(1)#10L]\r\n+- Join LeftOuter, (c1#34 <=> c1#1)\r\n   :- LocalRelation [c1#1, c2#2]\r\n   +- Project [if (isnull(alwaysTrue#32)) 0 else count(1)#33L AS count(1)#10L, c1#34]\r\n      +- Join LeftOuter, (c1#5 = c1#34)\r\n         :- Aggregate [c1#1], [c1#1 AS c1#34]\r\n         :  +- LocalRelation [c1#1]\r\n         +- Aggregate [c1#5], [count(1) AS count(1)#33L, c1#5, true AS alwaysTrue#32]\r\n            +- LocalRelation [c1#5]\r\n```\r\nand we have the correct answer:\r\n```\r\n+---+---+--------+\r\n|c1 |c2 |count(1)|\r\n+---+---+--------+\r\n|0  |1  |2       |\r\n|1  |2  |0       |\r\n+---+---+--------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFix a correctness bug with lateral join rewrite.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded SQL query tests. The results are consistent with Postgres' results.\r\n","created_at":"2021-06-24T23:44:16Z","updated_at":"2024-01-19T01:22:37Z","closed_at":"2021-07-13T09:35:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"98316eb47e4afef201bde71ee04617530d17ceab","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33070/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33070/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33070/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6404affe712161655d4740990222de7656a5fa83","head":{"label":"allisonwang-db:spark-35551-lateral-count-bug","ref":"spark-35551-lateral-count-bug","sha":"6404affe712161655d4740990222de7656a5fa83","user":{"login":"allisonwang-db","id":66282705,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MjgyNzA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66282705?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db","html_url":"https://github.com/allisonwang-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":271915022,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzE5MTUwMjI=","name":"spark","full_name":"allisonwang-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"allisonwang-db","id":66282705,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MjgyNzA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66282705?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db","html_url":"https://github.com/allisonwang-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/allisonwang-db/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nEnabing more `ObjectHashAggregate` for more aggregate functions, as it has better performance compared to `SortAggregate` according to current benchmark.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWe are pretty conservative with `ObjectHashAggregate` right now. Except for enabling it by configuring, there is also a fallback threshold. With the fallback threshold, it looks like that even `ObjectHashAggregate` is bad at memory estimation, it is unlikely to OOM easily. For now the users cannot work with `ObjectHashAggregate` for these aggregation functions even they enable the config. That's said, `ObjectHashAggregate` is not much able to be applicable under these limitations. As we are enough conservative with fallback threshold value, it is also disable-able using the config, the limitations on applicable aggregation functions look not necessary.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes. Some aggregations will be applied with `ObjectHashAggregate` after this change.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded unit tests.","created_at":"2021-06-24T21:45:06Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:27:26Z","closed_at":"2021-09-12T02:05:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"54785199eca0516e0a3b815dc31e25ca91fdee2a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33068/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/33068/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/33068/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3dd644f5e914ef2742bcca29c2825ee6a12f8ee8","head":{"label":"viirya:obj-hash","ref":"obj-hash","sha":"3dd644f5e914ef2742bcca29c2825ee6a12f8ee8","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

RENAME COLUMN` command to use `UnresolvedTable` as a `child` to resolve the table identifier. This allows consistent resolution rules (temp view first, etc.) to be applied for both v1/v2 commands. More info about the consistent resolution rule proposal can be found in [JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-29900) or [proposal doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hvLjGA8y_W_hhilpngXVub1Ebv8RsMap986nENCFnrg/edit?usp=sharing).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis is a part of effort to make the relation lookup behavior consistent: [SPARK-29900](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-29900).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nAfter this PR, the above `ALTER TABLE ...

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patches the hadoop configuration so that fs.s3a.endpoint is set to\r\ns3.amazonaws.com if neither it nor fs.s3a.endpoint.region is set.\r\n\r\nThis stops S3A Filesystem creation failing with the error\r\n\"Unable to find a region via the region provider chain.\"\r\nin some non-EC2 deployments.\r\n\r\nSee: HADOOP-17771.\r\n\r\nwhen spark options are propagated to the hadoop configuration\r\nin SparkHadoopUtils. the fs.s3a.endpoint value is set to\r\n\"s3.amazonaws.com\" if unset and no explicit region\r\nis set in fs.s3a.endpoint.region.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nA regression in Hadoop 3.3.1 has surfaced which causes S3A filesystem\r\ninstantiation to fail outside EC2 deployments if the host lacks\r\na CLI configuration in ~/.aws/config declaring the region, or\r\nthe `AWS_REGION` environment variable\r\n\r\nHADOOP-17771 fixes this in Hadoop-3.3.2+, but\r\nthis spark patch will correct the behavior when running\r\nSpark with the 3.3.1 artifacts.\r\n\r\nIt is harmless for older versions and compatible\r\nwith hadoop releases containing the

The only missing case is: `ShuffleExchangeExec` itself may contain subqueries(repartition expression) and AQE doesn't wait for it.\r\n\r\nA simple fix would be overwriting `waitForSubqueries` in `QueryStageExec`, and forward the request to shuffle/broadcast, but this PR proposes a different and probably cleaner way: we follow `execute`/`doExecute` in `SparkPlan`, and add similar APIs in the AQE version of \"execute\", which gets a future from shuffle/broadcast.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

PySpark DataFrame tests.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nBecause now the Koalas is ported into PySpark, so we don't need to Spark auto-patch anymore.\r\nAnd also `to_pandas_on_spark` is belongs to the pandas-on-Spark DataFrame doesn't look make sense.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, it's kinda internal refactoring stuff.\r\n\r\n### How was this
