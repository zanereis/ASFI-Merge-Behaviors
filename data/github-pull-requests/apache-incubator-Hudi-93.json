: Hoodie Utilities bundle does not include (and shade) hive jars unlike hoodie spark bundle. I have made changes to fix that.\r\n\r\nI have also removed the profile settings and added doc to show users how to compile against hadoop/hive versions that is used in their deployments. This turns out to be more reliable than making Apache Hive-1.1.1 client work in CDH runtime environment. By removing the profile settings, there is no reference of CDH in Hoodie mvn code. \r\n\r\nTesting:\r\nHoodie supports 3 types of environment (Apache Hive 2.x, Apache Hive 1.x, CDH Hive ). The maven profile settings change affects only the CDH version. I have tested hive sync against CDH environment.\r\n\r\nWe are also currently testing Deltastreamer against CDH environment to ensure they work end to end.

earlier versions of hoodie, the contract for a error record (a record with bad schema) was to throw an exception during getInsertValue() and then add this record to the failed records list, this prevents from failing the whole job for a single bad record. \r\n\r\nIn the latest release, this contract has changed. Due to the introduction of parallelizing read/write operations for Create/Merge handles, we are offloading the getInsertValue() to the reader thread to save time in the heavy operation and help in faster runtime. Since, getInsertValue() is called on the reader side, we throw an exception and fail the job even if a single row is with bad schema. \r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the code back to the original

PR allows for clients to perform nested/multiple rollbacks on MOR dataset. As a part of this PR, I would like for us to start a conversation around either keeping the client.rollback() API and supporting it going forward or deprecating the same. Let's share our thoughts on this. Personally, I feel that HUDI is used for storing large datasets. For a client to be able to implement recovery techniques, for example snapshot copy the entire dataset once in a while and then back it up might be very expensive. Either we support rollback (this is needed basically in case data corruption happens) or we as clients to incrementally read the dataset and keep backing up the incremental parts. This way, the snapshot copy is now a incremental copy and is fast at the same time if they ended up backing a corrupted file, they can just drop the last incremental backup and reingest all that data. The big con I see with this approach is that if you want to do this process for all your datasets, this would double the storage costs of any org which seems very inefficient.","created_at":"2019-01-03T18:21:53Z","updated_at":"2019-03-19T17:10:18Z","closed_at":"2019-03-19T17:10:17Z","merged_at":"2019-03-19T17:10:17Z","merge_commit_sha":"9e59da7fd96d8af0587efa2f34c89f56320d4c91","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/546/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/546/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/546/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/statuses/9d7df56651b86760773ea455a2a86d644f05f8a3","head":{"label":"n3nash:enable_multi_rollback_for_mor","ref":"enable_multi_rollback_for_mor","sha":"9d7df56651b86760773ea455a2a86d644f05f8a3","user":{"login":"n3nash","id":2722167,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MjIxNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2722167?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash","html_url":"https://github.com/n3nash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":79266493,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3OTI2NjQ5Mw==","name":"hoodie","full_name":"n3nash/hoodie","private":false,"owner":{"login":"n3nash","id":2722167,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MjIxNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2722167?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash","html_url":"https://github.com/n3nash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/n3nash/hoodie","description":"Spark

Fixed handling hard deletes for MergeOnRead table type. Essentially, instead of removing the entry from the MergedMap from the log files, we create a HoodieRecord with an empty() GenericRecord (this is what one would do in COW). Now, when the Map() is passed to `HoodieMergeHandle`, it will correctly drop rewriting the keys for which it seems empty records. \r\n2. Note, another change is that the `HoodieRecordPayload` implementation has to handle empty records (this would have to be done anyways for COW use-case). \r\n3. For a given row key, one could write an insert, then delete and then an insert again. In this case, the outcome is left completely to the implementation of the `HoodieRecordPayload`. In the preCombine() stage if there is one entry having an empty payload, the implementation can choose to either replace it with the new insert or keep it deleted. The default implementation in `HoodieAvroPayload` keeps it deleted.\r\n4. The HoodieRealTimeInputFormat / HoodieRealtimeRecordReader has also been fixed to ensure deleted records don't show up on the query side when merging log and parquet on the fly.\r\n\r\n@vinothchandar

scenarios where the bucket count is 1.9 for example, with the current code we end up rounding off to the closest lower integer. So in this case, the insertBucketCount would be 1. This would result in 2 buckets worth of data being routed to a single bucket (hence a single spark partition) and serializing writes to parquet. If the bucket count is rounded off to the largest integer, in this case 2, we would route records to 2 different spark partitions resulting in parallel writing of the parquet files and lower spark task times. \r\nNoticed this in our ingestion jobs where sometimes the job takes a long time due to this issue (more evident when writing out 1 GB parquet files)\r\n\r\n@vinothchandar @bvaradar

the GenericRecord only in the payload allows the payload to lose information when spilled to disk and back, hence change is to Serialize the whole payload instead.\r\nNote : There is no data loss but only some context lost which may be present in the payload implementation of a user.\r\n\r\nI have used SerializationUtils (which uses Java Serialization) to serde the payload. The side effect of this is that if the payload stores types which are serializable by Kryo (by registering them with Spark kryo), this serialization will fail. \r\nThe other option is to use Kryo serializer with JavaSerializer as default if kryo doesn't work. Working with Kryo is a little more involved since it's not as simple as converting payload to bytes, see here : https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/kryo\r\n@vinothchandar  @bvaradar Let me know your

: https://github.com/uber/hudi/issues/433\r\n\r\n    Hudi writing and Compaction step to use cached file-system view containing only needed file-slices to reduce name-node list-status calls\r\n    Write Path :\r\n         When using Bloom Filter index, listStatus is performed once and cached in BloomIndex for all interesting partition-paths. For other cases, listStatus is performed after records are prepped (indexed)\r\n         and before starting the IOHandle write stage. This helps avoid listStatus calls for each IOHandle (MergeHandle and AppendHandle) tasks. Depending on the partition-to-file distribution, the gains vary.\r\n         In case where all the fileIds to be merged/appended are in the same partition-path, we save n-1 listStatus calls where n is the number of fileIds changed. In case where only new parquet-files are generated\r\n         or the corner-case where there is exactly one fileId per partition getting appended/merged, #listStatus calls are break-even for bloom index.\r\n    Compaction Path:\r\n         Hoodie Compactor caches all the partitions which has atleast one fileId in the scheduled compaction plan. The benefits are similar to above except that only MergeHandle is used here which always does one listStatus\r\n         at partition-level. For cases where there are more than one fileId per partition getting compacted, we only do listStatus once per partition and save

Cannot allocate Memory:\r\nOur maven surefire configs causes one JVM forked process to run all tests in a single module serially.  \r\nLooking at different test logs where memory allocation failed, it was clear the issue is happening only when running tests in hoodie-client. \r\nDid some divide-n-conquer in localizing the tests by looking at Yourkit profile results and opening some dummy PRs which selectively disables some suspects ( https://github.com/bvaradar/hudi/pulls ). Was able to localize by disabling some of the tests which allowed the tests to pass in TravisCI. \r\n\r\nThe base-test class TestHoodieClientBase which sets up each HoodieClient tests and TestMergeOnReadTable was leaking resources.  Part of the PR fixes this.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Seeing Exception : FileSystemClosed when the JVM terminates.\r\n      This is caused by unchecked close of inputStream in HoodieLogReader. Also, found that we have not properly handled closing of HoodieLogFormatReader (which encapsulates multiple log file reading).  I had updated the code to explicitly call close() at different LogFileReader abstractions and also made all the unit-tests properly close the log-file readers they were using. This fixed the \"FileSystem closed\" exceptions we were seeing in

bug was introduced here : https://github.com/uber/hudi/commit/3da063f83b246f688304c6c40991482e6e1bdc9e#diff-4c9f153416cce4b19fd73b4f1dcbb1d1R219\r\n\r\nEssentially, the following situation takes place for MOR without inserts into log files : \r\n\r\n1. Write out all the file id's getting updated in the inflight file (saveWorkloadProfile information)\r\n\r\nIn case this was a failed commit : \r\n1. Read the affected file ids from the workload stored in the inflight file (only updated file ids are stored since file ids for inserts are unknown during workload profiling)\r\n2. First delete all the newly created parquet files based on the commit time.\r\n3. Iterate over all the file ids from the workload, filter out the updates only files and then append rollback blocks to revert updates.\r\n\r\nIn case of a successful commit being rolled back :\r\n1. Read the affected file ids from the workload stored in the commit file (note that now the file ids for the newly created parquet files and updated files both are present here)\r\n2. First delete all the newly created parquet files based on the commit time.\r\n3. Iterate over all the file ids from the workload, filter out the updates only and then append rollback blocks to revert updates. \r\n\r\nThe issue was there was no test case for the case when there are inserts + updates. The filter logic filtering out file ids from the workload for only updates was broken. The filter is now corrected.
