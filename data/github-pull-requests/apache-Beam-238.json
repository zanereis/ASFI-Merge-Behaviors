converts FileBasedSink from IOChannelFactory to FileSystems, with\r\nfallout changes on all existing Transforms that use WriteFiles.\r\n\r\nWe preserve the existing semantics of most transforms, simply adding the\r\nability for users to provide ResourceId in addition to String when\r\nsetting the outputPrefix.\r\n\r\nOther changes:\r\n\r\n* Make DefaultFilenamePolicy its own top-level class and move\r\n  IOChannelUtils#constructName into it. This the default FilenamePolicy\r\n  used by FilebasedSource.\r\n\r\n* Rethink FilenamePolicy as a function from ResourceId (base directory)\r\n  to ResourceId (output file), moving the base directory into the\r\n  context. This way, FilenamePolicy logic is truly independent from the\r\n  base directory. Using ResourceId#resolve, a filename policy can add\r\n  multiple path components, say, base/YYYY/MM/DD/file.txt, in a\r\n  fileystem independent way.\r\n\r\n  (Also add an optional extension parameter to the function, enabling an\r\n  owning transform to pass in the suffix from a separately-configured\r\n  compression factory or similar.)\r\n\r\n--- \r\nTODO:\r\n\r\n- [x] I cleaned up TextIO and AvroIO, but XmlIO and TFRecordIO need more.\r\n- [ ] Review test coverage.\r\n- [ ] REALLY review testing and javadoc.\r\n\r\nBut getting this out to be able to look at the comprehensive diff.\r\n\r\nCC: @davorbonaci @lukecwik @vikkyrk @jkff @reuvenlax @kennknowles

sure to do all of the following to help us incorporate your contribution\r\nquickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure the PR title is formatted like:\r\n   `[BEAM-<Jira issue #>] Description of pull request`\r\n - [ ] Make sure tests pass via `mvn clean verify`. (Even better, enable\r\n       Travis-CI on your fork and ensure the whole test matrix passes).\r\n - [ ] Replace `<Jira issue #>` in the title with the actual Jira issue\r\n       number, if there is one.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache\r\n       [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe test jar is for packaging the test suite of `gcp-core`, but `TestCredential` is\r\nnot part of the test suite. It is simply a class that `gcp-core` offers to other\r\nlibraries and belongs in the main artifact. Otherwise any users will have to\r\ndepend on the test suite in order to test their code, which doesn't make sense.\r\n\r\n@lukecwik @dhalperi @davorbonaci you probably each might have some opinions on this.\r\n\r\nThe test suite for XYZ is contained in the `test-jar` artifact aka `src/test` etc etc. Putting other things in here and asking users to take a dependency on the whole test suite doesn't make sense.\r\n\r\nMaven's scopes prevent this from causing dependency hell, by simply possibly not pulling in needed transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\n\"user's tests\"\r\n    --(test scope) --> \"TestCredential in test suite artifact\"\r\n    --(test scope)--> \"any deps not also main deps\"\r\n\r\nIf the last line is nonempty, the user will be broken. It only works by luck (yes, it usually will) because all of these deps will also be present as `compile` dependencies. So we've just forced the user to add cruft to their pom and pull in bundles of stuff they don't need.","created_at":"2017-04-27T20:37:13Z","updated_at":"2017-05-26T05:18:28Z","closed_at":"2017-04-27T20:59:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c1b453b853bef876f0049324b7b18427a30cb09d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/2745/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/2745/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/2745/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/952e56d74ff08c3b889e17e89d0ef9876a4453be","head":{"label":"kennknowles:TestCredential","ref":"TestCredential","sha":"952e56d74ff08c3b889e17e89d0ef9876a4453be","user":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52646147,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MjY0NjE0Nw==","name":"beam","full_name":"kennknowles/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles/beam","description":"Mirror
