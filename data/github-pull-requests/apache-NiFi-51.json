you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nExecuteGraphQueryRecord specifies a Failed Record Writer property that is meant to write out any records that fail during processing of the graph query. However the current implementation doesn't use it and instead sends the entire input flowfile to failure, and can result in a flowfile that doesn't get transferred (causing an exception). This PR refactors the processor to use the writer to write any failed records to the failure relationship.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as possible.\r\n","created_at":"2020-12-02T22:40:24Z","updated_at":"2020-12-23T18:04:00Z","closed_at":"2020-12-23T18:04:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6511fa95816703c62e3bcc2c838a58b7dfb684d8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/4704/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/4704/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/4704/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/statuses/8b452fe211198af13179261cd8b3b2787c963f2c","head":{"label":"mattyb149:NIFI-7906","ref":"NIFI-7906","sha":"8b452fe211198af13179261cd8b3b2787c963f2c","user":{"login":"mattyb149","id":2124747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjQ3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2124747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149","html_url":"https://github.com/mattyb149","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":28576559,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODU3NjU1OQ==","name":"nifi","full_name":"mattyb149/nifi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mattyb149","id":2124747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjQ3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2124747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149","html_url":"https://github.com/mattyb149","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mattyb149/nifi","description":"Mirror

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nMoves most NARs in the assembly POM to an enabled-by-default profile. It can be disabled from the command line by deactivating the profile:\r\n\r\n`-P\\!most-nars`\r\n\r\nThis results in an assembly package roughly 1/4 of the total size.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as possible.\r\n","created_at":"2020-12-02T21:19:35Z","updated_at":"2021-07-17T00:05:48Z","closed_at":"2021-07-17T00:05:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"aa104ba04cee255ce9b79919adf5954c62da4ca2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2915399856,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyOTE1Mzk5ODU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/4702/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/4702/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/4702/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/statuses/72edc0db67c1caa9a44e92e9d86188fb51974793","head":{"label":"mattyb149:NIFI-8063","ref":"NIFI-8063","sha":"72edc0db67c1caa9a44e92e9d86188fb51974793","user":{"login":"mattyb149","id":2124747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjQ3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2124747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149","html_url":"https://github.com/mattyb149","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":28576559,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODU3NjU1OQ==","name":"nifi","full_name":"mattyb149/nifi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mattyb149","id":2124747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjQ3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2124747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149","html_url":"https://github.com/mattyb149","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mattyb149/nifi","description":"Mirror

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nBefore this PR, the machine-friendly name was being shown in the documentation for dependent properties, which can make it difficult to map to the other property's name/doc. This minor change shows the display name instead.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

Description of PR\r\nTemplate/Flow definition for testing located in NIFI-8001 Jira ticket\r\n\r\nNIFI-8001 Dynamic Properties can be used to specify request (query string) parameters through ElasticsearchClientService processors (e.g. PutElasticsearchRecord)\r\n\r\nNIFI-8003 UpdateByQueryElasticsearch (based on existing DeleteByQueryElasticsearch) processor\r\n\r\nAddressed several warnings/inefficiencies within the existing processor/service implementations and fixed previously broken ES Integration tests (maven-failsafe-plugin 3-M5 doesn't currently work for these tests due to a classpath loading issue expected to be fixed in the upcoming -M6, so reverted to -M3 for the time being; also some of the integration tests didn't work when run together as one test would change the data that a subsequent test expected to be in its original state).\r\n\r\n\r\nImpacts #5193 (NIFI-8002), which uses the same request parameters approach to control paginated queries. This PR should be rebased if the other is merged first (or vice versa).\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nCalling ResultSet.next() on DB2 for the last row can result in it returning true but the ResultSet being closed. Any operation (such as getMetaData()) called on the ResultSet afterwards will result in an exception being thrown. This PR reverses the operations and ensures the ResultSet is not closed before the next row is fetched. There are no unit test changes, I verified no regressions in the existing unit tests, and verified on a DB2 instance.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-1930 Updated ListenHTTP to configure the Jetty SslContextFactory with included protocols based on the configuration of the SSLContextService _TLS Protocol_ property.  The Jetty SslContextFactory will be configured to support multiple current TLS protocol versions when the _TLS Protocol_ is configured without a specific version.  When the SSLContextService _TLS Protocol_ property specifies a particular TLS Protocol version, only that version will be allowed.\r\n\r\nThis update simplifies the configuration of the Jetty SslContextFactory by using the SSLContext created from SSLContextService, as opposed to passing the individual key store and trust store properties.  This update also introduces a new _Client Auth_ property for ListenHTTP to explicitly define the TLS client authentication policy.  Previous versions of ListenHTTP inferred the client authentication policy based on the presence or absence of trust store properties in the SSLContextService.  The _Client Auth_ property is defaulted to REQUIRED to support mutual TLS authentication, but all standard values are supported.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nSome SQL-based components were missing Default Precision and Default Scale properties, causing at least the Avro writer to fail using Oracle as the ResultSet returns zero for precision. Using these properties ensures a default precision/scale will be used when invalid precision/scale values are returned in the ResultSet\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

a 'User Groups Filter Expression' property to the LdapUserGroupProvider's configuration in authorizers.xml. When set, this property retrieves each user's groups according to the filter expressed in it and by replacing '{}' with the user's DN.\r\n\r\nThis introduces the possibility of filters such as : \"member:1.2.840.113556.1.4.1941:={}\". For each user, a request will be made and will populate all his direct and indirect groups.\r\nThis property can also be used to map groups to users regardless of the presence of an attribute that links the user to the group or vice versa. As long as a group satisfies the filter, the user will be assigned to it. The presence of '{}' (which is replaced by a user's DN) is optionnal.\r\n\r\nThe 'Group Search Base' property is used as the search base for each request but the 'User Group Name Attribute' property is not allowed when the new property is defined as it conflicts with it since they both rely on a user entry for group inference.\r\n\r\nAs mentionned in the JIRA issue, this property will offer more flexibility and will allow handling of nested groups which are necessary in Microsoft's AGDLP and other organizational security requirements.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\n_Enables X functionality; fixes bug NIFI-YYYY._\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

a 'User Groups Filter Expression' property to the LdapUserGroupProvider's configuration in authorizers.xml. When set, this property retrieves each user's groups according to the filter expressed in it and by replacing '{}' with the user's DN. \r\n\r\nThis introduces the possibility of filters such as : \"member:1.2.840.113556.1.4.1941:={}\". For each user, a request will be made and will populate all his direct and indirect groups. \r\nThis property can also be used to map groups to users regardless of the presence of an attribute that links the user to the group or vice versa. As long as a group satisfies the filter, the user will be assigned to it.  The presence of '{}' (which is replaced by a user's DN) is optionnal. \r\n\r\nThe 'Group Search Base' property is used as the search base for each request but the 'User Group Name Attribute' property is not allowed when the new property is defined as it conflicts with it since they both rely on a user entry for group inference. \r\n\r\nAs mentionned in the JIRA issue, this property will offer more flexibility and will allow handling of nested groups which are necessary in Microsoft's AGDLP and other organizational security requirements. \r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\n_Enables X functionality; fixes bug NIFI-YYYY._\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-8024 Added check for null ContentClaim in EncryptedFileSystemRepository.read() to avoid EOFException in following method implementation.  The standard FileSystemRepository.read() handles null ContentClaims, but the Encrypted implementation attempts to decrypt the contents.  This update brings the encrypted implementation in line with the standard implementation and adds a unit test for verification.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-8019 Added TlsPlatform utility class and updated multiple unit tests to use the getDefaultProtocols() and getLatestProtocol() methods.  Fedora 33 introduced a default Java Security configuration that disabled TLSv1 and TLSv1.1, which results in build failures for tests that expected those TLS protocols.  This problem can be duplicated on other platforms by adding TLSv1 and TLSv1.1 to jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms in the java.security configuration.  The TlsPlatform class uses the SSLContext.getDefaultSSLParameters().getProtocols() method to determine supported protocols at runtime.  This approach removes the need for checking Java versions in some tests.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Refactored nifi-framework-core/others to create a new nifi-framework-components module.\r\n- Refactored nifi-stateless to make use of nifi-framework-components\r\n- Removed requirement for nifi-framework-nar to be provided.\r\n- Refactored stateless nifi into api, engine, nar, and bootstrap modules, with a parent 'bundle' module\r\n- Creation of nifi-stateless-system-tests\r\n- Added unit tests and logging\r\n- Changed flow configuration to use properties file instead of json\r\n- Allow for -p parameter to specify parameters on command line\r\n- Moved implementations of Authorizer, NiFiUser, and UserGroupProviders to new module named nifi-framework-authorization-providers so that those that depend on nifi-framework-authorization don't have to bring in the providers. This way, we can have stateless not bring in those providers, as we otherwise get warnings on startup about the provider already being registered. Additionally, it avoids needing dependencies on spring-security-core\r\n- Updated bin/nifi.sh script to run new stateless bootstrap\r\n- Added Reporting Tasks to stateless.\r\n- Download bundles as necessary on stateless nifi startup\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\n_Enables X functionality; fixes bug NIFI-YYYY._\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Description of PR\r\n\r\nContinuation of PR #4153 (which appears to have stalled) by @gresockj.\r\n\r\nAddressed (@ijokarumawak & @MikeThomsen) comments from the above PR and:\r\n\r\n* NIFI-6403 - made TYPE optional on all Elasticsearch HTTP/Record processors\r\n  * default `_type` to `_all` for Fetch processor where TYPE property is unset/blank\r\n  * note that using `_type` is still possible in ES 6 & 7, but deprecated and discouraged; the expectation is that trying to use `_type` as of ES 8+ will not be possible, so some processors might then be unusable\r\n  * decided to take the approach that Elasticsearch should apply its own version-specific logic and not to try and replicate parts of that within NiFi (this is the main difference between this PR and the original one linked above)\r\n* NIFI-6404 - use `_source` query string parameter instead of `_source_include(s)` as it's compatible between ES <6 and 6+\r\n\r\nCommits:\r\n\r\n1.

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nThis PR adds an UpdateHive3Table processor (and copies of it for Hive 1 and Hive 1.1 packages) that compares an incoming flow file against a Hive table definition and will add columns and partition values as needed, and will create a table using the incoming record schema if configured to do so.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nA new processor that allows NiFi to store Prometheus metrics as a Remote Write Adapter.  \r\n\r\nPrometheus's local storage is limited by single nodes in its scalability and durability. Instead of trying to solve clustered storage in Prometheus itself, Prometheus has a set of interfaces that allow integrating with remote storage systems.\r\n\r\nThe Remote Write feature in Prometheus allows sending samples to a third party storage system. There is a list of specialized remote endpoints here [1].\r\n\r\nWith this NiFi Prometheus Remote Write Processor you can store the metrics in whatever storage supported in NiFi, even to store in several storages at the same time with the advantages of NiFi routing capabilities.\r\n\r\n[1] https://prometheus.io/docs/operating/integrations/#remote-endpoints-and-storage\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [x] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

Description of PR\r\n\r\nDevelopment has stopped on this [PR](https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/4221) so I picked up the changes and addressed the comments. This PR removes the hardcoded limit for viewing files in the flow file list queue. Adds a \"View All\" button to load all available flow files for a given connection, then has an option for exporting those files to CSV. The files could then be sorted/explored in another data analysis tool.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61026014/97916880-9ec88600-1d21-11eb-86fa-d812b31fcaea.png)\r\n\r\n_Enables Flowfile list queue CSV Export\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Description of PR\r\n\r\nHi there! :wave:\r\n\r\n(Opening this as draft this I'm still evaluating options, but the overall plan presented in this PR sounds promising.)\r\n\r\nI work on Agent integrations at Datadog, and looked into resolving a few pain points related to the `DataDogReportingTask` that we've been hearing from customers, tracked in the following tickets:\r\n\r\n- [NIFI-4713](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-4713) - Processor name shouldn't be embedded into metric name\r\n- [NIFI-5535](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-5535) - Reporting task generates too many custom metrics (due to metric names and tags)\r\n\r\nThis PR contains the following changes (unchecked items still TODO):\r\n\r\n- [x] Remove all tags from metrics except from `env` (for all metrics) and `processor` (for processor metrics only).\r\n- [x] Drop the processor name from the name of metrics (eg `nifi.exampleProcessor.FlowFilesReceivedLast5Minutes` -> `nifi.FlowFilesReceivedLast5Minutes`, and `nifi.flow.ActiveThreads` -> `nifi.ActiveThreads`) and submit it as a tag\r\n\r\nThese changes are so that the `DataDogReporting` task plays better with Datadog, in particular:\r\n\r\n- Allow users to use native functionality allowed by tagging, such as filtering, grouping, etc.\r\n- Remove drastically the amount of `metric x tags` possible values, in order to reduce the number of custom metrics this reporting task generates. Now number of custom metrics is `23 + 6 * num_processors`, instead of potentially thousands or more.\r\n\r\n**Note**: a natural follow-up to this PR would be to implement a configuration mechanism so that users have better control on what groups of metrics they'd like to collect. These groups would probably be: `processors`, `connection_statuses`, `input_port_statuses`, `output_port_statuses`, `jvm`, and `data_flow`. This has been requested in both NIFI-4713 and NIFI-5535, and would allow users to reduce even more the number of custom metrics so that only what they need is pushed to Datadog. This is completely orthogonal to what this PR focuses on: it won't require any changes to the metric names, values, or tags. So I'm keeping this for a follow-up PR.\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

forces PutAzureBlobStorage to stream writes to avoid OOMEs; fixes NIFI-7964.\r\n\r\n~~**NOTE**: I've marked this as a draft because it'd be helpful to see if anyone sees a performance impact by applying this in all cases.~~\r\n\r\n**NOTE**: It'd be nice to have an IT for this but the `TestRunner` reads everything into memory for enqueuing, so it can't be tested that way. If you're looking to replicate the problem and the fix you can create a flow with `[GetFile] --> [PutAzureBlobStorage]` and generate a test file as follows; the resulting file should be slightly over 512MB:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nopenssl rand -out /tmp/nifi/blob/test.txt -base64 402653184\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've tested the following scenarios:\r\n* Putting files > heap on any version < 1.12.1 results in an OOME.\r\n* Putting files >= heap for heap sizes of 512MB and 4GB is successful with the change.\r\n* There is no noticeable throughput difference between 1.12.1 and this change. With small files > 50 MB/s on a single node is achievable without any tuning.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as possible.\r\n","created_at":"2020-10-29T00:03:34Z","updated_at":"2021-01-06T12:48:27Z","closed_at":"2021-01-06T12:48:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"41f21a93069f46f1d91d854ea566bd389dee8b20","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/4632/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/4632/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/4632/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/statuses/a3eef96f8fb561f6f5de3debc0c21b8d84fadbd7","head":{"label":"jfrazee:NIFI-7964","ref":"NIFI-7964","sha":"a3eef96f8fb561f6f5de3debc0c21b8d84fadbd7","user":{"login":"jfrazee","id":47344,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47344?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfrazee","html_url":"https://github.com/jfrazee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfrazee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfrazee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfrazee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfrazee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfrazee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfrazee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfrazee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfrazee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfrazee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":53608657,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MzYwODY1Nw==","name":"nifi","full_name":"jfrazee/nifi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jfrazee","id":47344,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47344?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfrazee","html_url":"https://github.com/jfrazee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfrazee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfrazee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfrazee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfrazee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfrazee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfrazee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfrazee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfrazee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfrazee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jfrazee/nifi","description":"Mirror

Key Path property is invalid\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR \r\nThe FetchSFTP processor utilized StandardValidator FileExistsValidator which allowed for directory names to be valid and not full path name to a file resulting in \"not.found\" errors being generated on PrivateKey path value. Corrected StandardValidators.FileExistsValidator to declare validation as \"false\" if path is to a directory. This change required modification of Junit tests that were using \"./\" as file path values, replacing values with valid \"junk\" file path.\r\n\r\n Fixes bug NIFI-7225._\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [x] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [x] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [x] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [x] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

PR adds the ability to authenticate to NiFi via a SAML identity provider, similar to how OIDC authentication works.\r\n\r\nIn addition, there is an option to obtain group membership info from the assertions in a successful SAML AuthN response from the IDP. These groups are then passed along in the NiFiUser instance in order to be leveraged during authorization. Currently if using the file-based policy provider, then these groups would also have to exist in the configured user-group-provider in order to have created policies against them.\r\n\r\nThe integration with spring-security-saml is heavily based on the primary example application here:\r\nhttps://github.com/vdenotaris/spring-boot-security-saml-sample\r\n\r\nI've primarily tested against KeyCloak and the SSOCirlce IDP which is used by the example app above (https://www.ssocircle.com/en/). \r\n\r\nHigh-level changes:\r\n- Add dependency on spring-security-saml2-core\r\n- Updated AccessResource with new SAML end-points\r\n- Updated Login/Logout filters to handle SAML scenario\r\n- Updated logout process to track a logout request using a cookie\r\n- Added database storage for cached SAML credential and user groups\r\n- Updated proxied requests when clustered to send IDP groups in a header\r\n- Updated X509 filter to process the IDP groups from the header if present\r\n- Updated admin guide\r\n- Fixed logout action on error page\r\n- Updated StandardManagedAuthorizer to combine groups from request with groups from lookup\r\n- Updated UserGroupProvider implementations with more efficient impl of getGroupByName\r\n- Added/updated unit

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nIn isArrayTypeCompatible() we just check to see if the object is an Object[] instead of verifying that each element is of the specified type. This PR runs through the objects in the array to make sure they are each compatible with the specified element type.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as possible.\r\n","created_at":"2020-10-20T22:38:12Z","updated_at":"2020-10-27T15:39:29Z","closed_at":"2020-10-27T15:39:29Z","merged_at":"2020-10-27T15:39:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"4fee07656169e4f1df723ad5e5b8769dddcfdb04","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/4612/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/4612/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/4612/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/statuses/07c711cecf294e4073acbcb4ebd37cde738cf3b9","head":{"label":"mattyb149:NIFI-7637","ref":"NIFI-7637","sha":"07c711cecf294e4073acbcb4ebd37cde738cf3b9","user":{"login":"mattyb149","id":2124747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjQ3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2124747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149","html_url":"https://github.com/mattyb149","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":28576559,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODU3NjU1OQ==","name":"nifi","full_name":"mattyb149/nifi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mattyb149","id":2124747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjQ3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2124747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149","html_url":"https://github.com/mattyb149","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mattyb149/nifi","description":"Mirror

In order to provide backwards compatibility, StandardFlowFileMediaType includes both VERSION_1 and VERSION_UNSPECIFIED values to support these processors.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [X] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as possible.\r\n","created_at":"2020-10-17T16:34:51Z","updated_at":"2021-01-04T19:20:06Z","closed_at":"2021-01-04T19:20:06Z","merged_at":"2021-01-04T19:20:06Z","merge_commit_sha":"e7c6bdad42514200d8732b644c59dcb789e358da","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/4609/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/4609/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/4609/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/statuses/47a6e9f507bf4239d5e8069958c32c9c5dac2405","head":{"label":"exceptionfactory:NIFI-7937","ref":"NIFI-7937","sha":"47a6e9f507bf4239d5e8069958c32c9c5dac2405","user":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":297800463,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTc4MDA0NjM=","name":"nifi","full_name":"exceptionfactory/nifi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory/nifi","description":"Apache
