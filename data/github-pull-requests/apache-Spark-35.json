If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently, the spark conf `spark.log.structuredLogging.enabled` is not taking effect. The current code base checks this config in the method `prepareSubmitEnvironment`. However, Log4j is already initialized before that. \r\n\r\nThis PR is to fix it by checking the config `spark.log.structuredLogging.enabled` before the initialization of Log4j.\r\nAlso, this PR enhances the doc for this configuration.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nBug fix.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR improves the error message when a table-valued function call has a TABLE argument with a PARTITION BY or ORDER BY clause with more than one associated expression, but forgets parentheses around them.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT * FROM testUDTF(\r\n  TABLE(SELECT 1 AS device_id, 2 AS data_ds)\r\n  WITH SINGLE PARTITION\r\n  ORDER BY device_id, data_ds)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis query previously returned an obscure, unrelated error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[UNSUPPORTED_SUBQUERY_EXPRESSION_CATEGORY.UNSUPPORTED_TABLE_ARGUMENT] Unsupported subquery expression: Table arguments are used in a function where they are not supported:\r\n'UnresolvedTableValuedFunction [tvf], [table-argument#338 [],

call includes a table argument with an invalid partitioning/ordering specification: the ORDER BY clause included multiple expressions without parentheses surrounding them; please add parentheses around these expressions and then retry the query again.

Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nHere we improve error messages for common SQL syntax mistakes.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, see above.\r\n\r\n### How was

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to \r\n1.migrate `error/warn/info` in module `SQL` with variables to `structured logging framework` for java side.\r\n2.convert all dependencies on `org.slf4j.Logger & org.slf4j.LoggerFactory` to `org.apache.spark.internal.Logger & org.apache.spark.internal.LoggerFactory`, in order to completely `prohibit` importing `org.slf4j.Logger & org.slf4j.LoggerFactory` in java code later.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo enhance Apache Spark's logging system by implementing structured logging.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Pass GA.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/46034, there was a complicated edge case where common expression references in aggregate functions in the child of a `With` expression could become dangling. An assertion was added to avoid that case from happening, but the assertion wasn't fully accurate as a query like:\r\n```\r\nselect\r\n  id between max(if(id between 1 and 2, 2, 1)) over () and id\r\nfrom range(10)\r\n```\r\nwould fail the assertion.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the assertion to be more accurate.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis addresses a regression in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/46034.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded unit tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a follow-up of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/38029 . Some custom check rules need to see the entire query plan tree to get some context, but https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/38029 breaks it as it checks the query plan of dangling CTE relations recursively.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes it by putting back the dangling CTE relation in the main query plan and then check the main query plan.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nRevert the breaking change to custom check rules\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo for most users. This restores the behavior of Spark 3.3 and earlier for custom check rules.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nexisting tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces three bitwise shifting operators as aliases for existing shifting functions.\r\n \r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe bit shifting functions named in alphabet form vary from one platform to anthor. Take our shiftleft as an example,\r\n- Hive, shiftleft (where we copied it from)\r\n- MsSQL Server LEFT_SHIFT\r\n- MySQL, N/A\r\n- PostgreSQL, N/A\r\n- Presto,  bitwise_left_shift\r\n\r\nThe [bit shifting operators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operations_in_C) share a much more common and consistent way for users to port their queries.\r\n\r\nFor self-consistent with existing bit operators in Spark, `AND   &`, `OR    |`, `XOR   ^` and `NOT   ~`, we now add `<<`, `>>` and `>>>`.\r\n\r\nFor other systems that we can refer to:\r\n\r\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/functions/left-shift-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver16\r\nhttps://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/functions-bitstring.html\r\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/bit-functions.html\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, new operators were added but no behavior change\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nnew tests\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a follow-up of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/38029 . Some custom check rules need to see the entire query plan tree to get some context, but https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/38029 breaks it as it checks the query plan of dangling CTE relations recursively.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes it by putting back the dangling CTE relation in the main query plan and then check the main query plan.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nRevert the breaking change to custom check rules\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo for most users. This restores the behavior of Spark 3.3 and earlier for custom check rules.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nexisting tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write

This requires addition of escape characters for these expressions. Unfortunately, MySQL uses ESCAPE '\\\\' syntax instead of ESCAPE '\\' which would cause errors when trying to push down.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTests for each existing dialect.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-05-07T12:06:13Z","updated_at":"2024-05-15T02:16:56Z","closed_at":"2024-05-14T15:31:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c2fb06c700360ff94013898de8af5ed717e374cb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46437/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46437/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/46437/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/45fcb60a9b8d8e45c152973acb19f9cd2734983c","head":{"label":"mihailom-db:SPARK-48172","ref":"SPARK-48172","sha":"45fcb60a9b8d8e45c152973acb19f9cd2734983c","user":{"login":"mihailom-db","id":159067682,"node_id":"U_kgDOCXsuIg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/159067682?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db","html_url":"https://github.com/mihailom-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":756245919,"node_id":"R_kgDOLRNlnw","name":"spark","full_name":"mihailom-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mihailom-db","id":159067682,"node_id":"U_kgDOCXsuIg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/159067682?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db","html_url":"https://github.com/mihailom-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mihailom-db/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a follow-up to a previous improvement - 7d04d0f0.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, particularly when running older versions of the Spark\r\ncluster (3.5), the error actually manifests as a mismatch in the\r\nobserved server-side session id between calls.\r\n\r\nWith this fix, we also capture this case and ensure that this case is\r\nalso handled.\r\n\r\nFurther, we improve the implementation of `getActiveSession()`\r\nand introduce a similar `getDefaultSession()` that accounts for\r\nstopped sessions.\r\nThis ensures that all places where default or active session is used,\r\nstopped sessions are considered neither default nor active.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nExplained above.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nPreviously, when client encounters a session mismatch, a user\r\ncannot create a new session. With this change, a user can\r\ncall `getOrCreate()` on the SparkSession builder and create a\r\nnew session.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAttached unit tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAs part of re-enabling the ANSI mode tests for Spark Connect, we discovered that we don't have an equivalent for `try_*` for the remainder of operations. This patch adds the `try_remainder` function in Scala, Python, and Spark Connect and adds the required testing.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nANSI and Spark 4\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, it adds the `try_remainder` function that behaves according to ANSI for division by zero.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new UT and E2E tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to disable a flaky test, `SparkConnectServiceSuite.SPARK-43923: commands send events - get_resources_command`, temporarily.\r\n\r\nTo re-enable this, SPARK-48164 is created as a blocker issue for 4.0.0.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis test case was added at `Apache Spark 3.5.0`, but it has been flaky and causes many re-tries in our GitHub Action CI environment.\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/42454\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/apache/spark/actions/runs/8979348499/job/24661200052\r\n```\r\n[info] - SPARK-43923: commands send events ((get_resources_command {\r\n[info] }\r\n[info] ,None)) *** FAILED *** (35

issue as a blocker level before going on `Spark Connect GA` in SPARK-48164 before Apache Spark 4.0.0.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-05-07T04:13:54Z","updated_at":"2024-05-08T14:24:47Z","closed_at":"2024-05-07T04:39:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bf3745ea471cdd74f2b770fa85ec44b75e1d8327","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46425/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46425/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/46425/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a5c76a6ea6c9d6d62b2b8afc8d4570444b73d367","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-48163","ref":"SPARK-48163","sha":"a5c76a6ea6c9d6d62b2b8afc8d4570444b73d367","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":677218341,"node_id":"R_kgDOKF2IJQ","name":"spark","full_name":"dongjoon-hyun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun/spark","description":"Apache

When we close the hdfs state store, we should only remove the entry from `loadedMaps` rather than doing the active data cleanup. JVM GC should be able to help us GC those objects.\r\n* we should wait for the maintenance thread to stop before unloading the providers.\r\n\r\nThere are two race conditions between state store snapshotting and state store unloading which could result in query failure and potential data corruption.\r\n\r\nCase 1:\r\n1. the maintenance thread pool encounters some issues and call the [stopMaintenanceTask,](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/d9d79a54a3cd487380039c88ebe9fa708e0dcf23/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/streaming/state/StateStore.scala#L774) this function further calls [threadPool.stop.](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/streaming/state/StateStore.scala#L587) However, this function doesn't wait for the stop operation to be completed and move to do the state store [unload and clear.](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/d9d79a54a3cd487380039c88ebe9fa708e0dcf23/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/streaming/state/StateStore.scala#L775-L778)\r\n2. the provider unload will [close the state store](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/streaming/state/StateStore.scala#L719-L721) which [clear the values of loadedMaps](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/streaming/state/HDFSBackedStateStoreProvider.scala#L353-L355) for HDFS backed state store.\r\n3. if the not-yet-stop maintenance thread is still running and trying to do the snapshot, but the data in the underlying `HDFSBackedStateStoreMap` has been removed. if this snapshot process completes successfully, then we will write corrupted data and the following batches will consume this corrupted data.\r\n\r\nCase 2:\r\n\r\n1. In executor_1, the maintenance thread is going to do the snapshot for state_store_1, it retrieves the `HDFSBackedStateStoreMap` object from the loadedMaps, after this, the maintenance thread [releases the lock of the loadedMaps](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/c6696cdcd611a682ebf5b7a183e2970ecea3b58c/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/streaming/state/HDFSBackedStateStoreProvider.scala#L750-L751).\r\n2. state_store_1 is loaded in another executor, e.g. executor_2.\r\n3. another state store, state_store_2, is loaded on executor_1 and [reportActiveStoreInstance](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/streaming/state/StateStore.scala#L854-L871) to driver.\r\n4. executor_1 does the [unload](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/c6696cdcd611a682ebf5b7a183e2970ecea3b58c/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/streaming/state/StateStore.scala#L713) for those no longer active state store which clears the data entries in the `HDFSBackedStateStoreMap`\r\n5. the snapshotting thread is terminated and uploads the incomplete snapshot to cloud because the [iterator doesn't have next element](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/c6696cdcd611a682ebf5b7a183e2970ecea3b58c/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/streaming/state/HDFSBackedStateStoreProvider.scala#L634)

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe `try_parse_json` expression added in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/46141 declares improper output nullability: the `try_` version's output must be marked as nullable. This PR corrects the nullability and adds a test.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIncorrectly declaring an expression's output as non-nullable when it is actually nullable may lead to crashes.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, it affects output nullability and thus may affect query result schemas.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit test cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, when reading a JSON like this:\r\n```\r\n{\"a\": {\"b\": -999.99999999999999999999999999999999995}}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith the schema:\r\n```\r\na STRING\r\n```\r\n\r\nSpark will yield a result like this:\r\n```\r\n{\"b\": -1000.0}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOther changes such as changes to the input string's whitespace may also occur. In some cases, we apply scientific notation to an input floating-point number when reading it as STRING.\r\n\r\nThis applies to reading JSON files (as with `spark.read.json`) as well as the SQL expression `from_json`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCorrectness issues may occur if a field is read as a STRING and then later parsed (e.g. with `from_json`) after the contents have been modified.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, when reading non-string fields from a JSON object using the STRING type, we will now extract the field exactly as it appears.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded a test in `JsonSuite.scala`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to serialize `build_python.yml` to run a single Python version per cron schedule to reduce the maximum concurrency per single GitHub Action job.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently, `build_python.yml` triggers 60 jobs. `30` of `60` jobs are running concurrently because 10 test pipelines are required per Python version.\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/apache/spark/actions/workflows/build_python.yml\r\n\r\n<img width=\"731\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-05-06 at 14 28 08\"

job concurrency level less than or equal to 15.\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, the maximum concurrently level will be 10.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual review because this is a daily CI.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nSince we are targeting on migration INFO/WARN/ERROR level logs to structure logging, this PR removes the logDebug and logTrace methods from the JAVA structured logging framework.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIn the log migration PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/46390, there are unnecessary changes such as updating\r\n```\r\nlogger.debug(\"Task {} need to spill {} for {}\", taskAttemptId,\r\n            Utils.bytesToString(required - got), requestingConsumer);\r\n```\r\nto\r\n```\r\nLOGGER.debug(\"Task {} need to spill {} for {}\", String.valueOf(taskAttemptId),\r\n            Utils.bytesToString(required - got), requestingConsumer.toString());\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this PR, we can avoid such changes during log migrations.\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nExisting UT.\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n[SPARK-47353](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-47353)\r\n\r\n#### Pull requests\r\n\r\n[Scala TreeMap (RB Tree)](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/46404)\r\n[GroupMapReduce](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/46526) <- Most performant\r\n [Comparing Experimental Approaches ](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/46488)\r\n\r\n#### Central Change to Mode `eval` Algorithm:\r\n - Update to `eval` Method: The `eval` method now checks if the column being looked at is string with non-default collation and if so, uses a `TreeMap` to manage keys and counts. - TreeMap takes a comparator to determine equality, so supports an efficient combination of counts by keys equal under that comparator but that were not by the OpenHashMap, which uses the default _physical_ equality.\r\n\r\n#### Minor Change to Mode:\r\n- Introduction of `collationId`: A new lazy value `collationId` is computed from the `dataType` of the `child` expression, used to fetch the appropriate collation comparator when `collationEnabled` is true.\r\n\r\n #### Unit Test Enhancements: Significant additions to `CollationStringExpressionsSuite` to test new functionality including:\r\n- Tests for the `Mode` function when handling strings with different collation settings.\r\n\r\n #### Benchmark Updates:\r\n- Enhanced the `CollationBenchmark` classes to include benchmarks for the new mode functionality with and without collation settings, as well as numerical types.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n1. Ensures consistency in handling string comparisons under various collation settings.\r\n2. Improves global usability by enabling compatibility with different collation standards.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, this PR introduces the following user-facing changes:\r\n\r\n1. Adds a new `collationEnabled` property to the `Mode` expression.\r\n2. Users can now specify collation settings for the `Mode` expression to customize its behavior.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis patch was tested through a combination of new and existing unit and end-to-end SQL tests.\r\n\r\n1. **Unit Tests:**\r\n   - **CollationStringExpressionsSuite:**\r\n     - TODO/WIP: Make the newly added tests more in the same design pattern as the existing tests\r\n    - Added multiple test cases to verify that the `Mode` function correctly handles strings with different collation settings.\r\n     - Specifically, tests include:\r\n       - **UTF8_BINARY_LCASE Collation:** Verified that the function behaves as expected when processing lower-case-sensitive data.\r\n       - **Null Handling:** Included tests for correct handling of null values with various collation settings.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. **Benchmark Tests:**\r\n     - TODO DISCUSS PERFORMANCE\r\n\r\n4. **Manual Testing:**\r\n\r\n```\r\n ./build/mvn -DskipTests clean package \r\nexport SPARK_HOME=/Users/gideon/repos/spark\r\n$SPARK_HOME/bin/spark-shell\r\n   spark.sqlContext.setConf(\"spark.sql.collation.enabled\", \"true\")\r\n    import org.apache.spark.sql.types.StringType\r\n    import org.apache.spark.sql.functions\r\n    import spark.implicits._\r\n    val data = Seq((\"Def\"), (\"def\"), (\"DEF\"), (\"abc\"), (\"abc\"))\r\n    val df = data.toDF(\"word\")\r\n    val dfLC = df.withColumn(\"word\",\r\n      col(\"word\").cast(StringType(\"UTF8_BINARY_LCASE\")))\r\n    val dfLCA = dfLC.agg(org.apache.spark.sql.functions.mode(functions.col(\"word\")).as(\"count\"))\r\n    dfLCA.show()\r\n/*\r\nBEFORE:\r\n-----+\r\n|count|\r\n+-----+\r\n|  abc|\r\n+-----+\r\n\r\nAFTER:\r\n+-----+\r\n|count|\r\n+-----+\r\n|  Def|\r\n+-----+\r\n\r\n*/\r\n```\r\n\r\n6. **Continuous Integration (CI):**\r\n   - The patch passed all relevant Continuous Integration (CI) checks, including:\r\n     - Unit test suite\r\n     - Benchmark suite [TODO RUN AND ATTACH RESULTS]\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo, but the PR Description was co-authored with Chat-GPT.\r\n\r\n### What is left to do before taking off the WIP tag?\r\n \r\n\r\n- [ ] Discuss/analyze performance in PR Description\r\n- [ ] Make sure benchmarks invoke the function enough times to have non-zero values in the benchmark results\r\n- [ ] Run benchmarks in GHA and add resultant benchmark reports to Pull Request\r\n- [x] Make the newly added tests more in the same design pattern as the existing tests\r\n- [x] Make the newly added tests cover all collations\r\n- [ ] Figure out within group return value (EG if lower case collation, between  Seq((\"Def\"), (\"def\"), (\"def\"), (\"DEF\"), (\"abc\"), (\"abc\"), (\"abc\")), is Def, DEF, or def the answer?\r\n- Choices are\r\n1.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to\r\n- make the module `spark-profiler` as a part of Spark release\r\n- publish the module `spark-profiler` to `maven central repository`\r\n- add instructions on how to compile supports `spark-profiler` in the doc `docs/building-spark.md` \r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1.The modules released in the current daily `spark-4.0.0` do not include `spark-profiler`. I believe that according to the current logic, the `spark-profiler` will not appear in the future official version of spark.\r\n\r\n2.Align the compilation description of other modules in doc `docs/building-spark.md`, eg:\r\n<img width=\"935\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/15246973/7ecb5cf2-6ab4-46f5-ae2f-76ef944bdda4\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, make it easy for users to use `spark-profiler` in the future version of Spark, instead of manually compiling `spark-profiler` based on source code.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Pass GA.\r\n- It is necessary to observe whether the daily snapshots `spark-profilter_2.13` generate\r\nhttps://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/apache/spark/spark-profiler_2.13/4.0.0-SNAPSHOT/\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n* Currently, `canPlanAsBroadcastHashJoin` incorrectly returns that a join can be planned as a BHJ, even though the join contains a SHJ.\r\n* To fix this, add some logic that checks whether the join contains a SHJ hint before checking if the join can be broadcasted.\r\n* Also made a small refactor to the `JoinSelectionHelperSuite` to make it a bit more readable.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n* `canPlanAsBroadcastHashJoin` should be in sync with the join selection in `SparkStrategies`. Currently, it is not in sync.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, semi / anti joins that could not have been planned as broadcasts would now not be pushed through aggregates anymore. Generally, this would be a performance improvement.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n* Added UTs to check that a join with a SHJ hint is not marked as being planned as a BHJ.\r\n* Added tests to keep `canPlanAsBroadcastHashJoin` and the `JoinSelection` codepath in sync.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nNew lightweight exception for control-flow between UnivocityParser and FalureSafeParser to speed-up malformed CSV parsing\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nParsing in `PermissiveMode` is slow due to heavy exception construction (stacktrace filling + string template substitution in `SparkRuntimeException`)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, since `FailureSafeParser` unwraps `BadRecordException` and correctly rethrows user-facing exceptions in `FailFastMode`\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- `testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.csv.UnivocityParserSuite`\r\n- Manually run csv benchmark on DB benchmark workspace\r\n- Manually checked correct and malformed csv in sherk-shell (org.apache.spark.SparkException is thrown with the stacktrace)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWe have been providing a dedicated test environment for `yarn` and `connect` module because they are flaky.\r\n- #45107\r\n\r\nHowever, they are still flaky. So, this PR aims to run `yarn` test only in PR builders (if needed) and Daily CIs (always).\r\n- Reduce the irrelevant re-tries by triggering `YARN CI` only when we need to test `YARN` module.\r\n- Protect YARN CI from `connect` flakiness by providing an independent GitHub Action environment in PR Builders and Daily CIs.\r\n- Lastly, commit builder will offload YARN module tests to the daily CIs\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n- PR builders provide an extensive test coverage with YARN testing.\r\n- Daily CIs with YARN tests\r\n   - NON-ANSI CI: https://github.com/apache/spark/actions/workflows/build_non_ansi.yml (1AM)\r\n   - Java 21 SBT CI: https://github.com/apache/spark/actions/workflows/build_java21.yml (4AM)\r\n   - RockDB UI CI: https://github.com/apache/spark/actions/workflows/build_rockdb_as_ui_backend.yml (6AM)\r\n   - Maven Java 17 CI: https://github.com/apache/spark/actions/workflows/build_maven.yml (1PM)\r\n   - Maven Java 21 CI: https://github.com/apache/spark/actions/workflows/build_maven_java21.yml (2PM)\r\n   - Maven Java 21 on AppleSilicon CI: https://github.com/apache/spark/actions/workflows/build_maven_java21_macos14.yml (8PM every two days)\r\n\r\n- YARN CI has been flaky in GitHub Action environment and requires irrelevant re-tries very frequently.\r\n    - https://github.com/apache/spark/actions/runs/8962451417/job/24611353908 (2024-05-05)\r\n    - https://github.com/apache/spark/actions/runs/8962440192/job/24611326971

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to run `buf` and `ui` tests only in PR builders and Java 21 Daily CI.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently, Apache Spark CI is running `buf` and `ui` tests always because they finish quickly.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/32ba5c1db62caaaa2674e8acced56f89ed840bf9/.github/workflows/build_and_test.yml#L102-L103\r\n\r\n- `buf` job\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/32ba5c1db62caaaa2674e8acced56f89ed840bf9/.github/workflows/build_and_test.yml#L571-L574\r\n\r\n- `ui` job\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/32ba5c1db62caaaa2674e8acced56f89ed840bf9/.github/workflows/build_and_test.yml#L1049-L1052\r\n\r\nHowever, ASF Infra team's guideline recommends to maintain the job concurrency level under or equal to `15`. We had better offload `buf` and `ui` from per-commit CI.\r\n\r\n- https://infra.apache.org/github-actions-policy.html\r\n\r\n> All workflows SHOULD have a job concurrency level less than or equal to 15.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo because this is an infra update.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs and manual review because PR builders will not be affected by this.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn a Scenario where we use GroupBy in PySpark API with relabeling of aggregate columns and using as_index = False,\r\nthe columns with which we group by are not returned in the DataFrame. The change proposes to fix this bug.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\nps.DataFrame({\"a\": [0, 0], \"b\": [0, 1]}).groupby(\"a\", as_index=False).agg(b_max=(\"b\", \"max\"))\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n_  b_max\r\n0      1 \r\n\r\nRequired Result:\r\n_  a  b_max\r\n0  0      1  \r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe relabeling part of the code only uses only the aggregate columns. In a scenario where as_index=True, it is not an issue as the columns with which we group by are included in the index. When as_index=False, we need to append the columns with which we grouped by to the relabeling code.\r\n\r\nPlease, check the commits/PR for the code changes\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Passed GA\r\n- Passed Build tests\r\n- Unit Tested including scenarios in addition to the one provided in the Jira ticket\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2024-05-05T16:17:03Z","updated_at":"2024-05-08T00:44:20Z","closed_at":"2024-05-08T00:44:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7e0ee3a20218cfbfe2943e69d191ac5fe5db3338","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4138679613,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs72rz09","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PANDAS%20API%20ON%20SPARK","name":"PANDAS

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to \r\n1.migrate `error/warn/info` in module `core` with variables to `structured logging framework` for java side.\r\n2.convert all dependencies on `org.slf4j.Logger & org.slf4j.LoggerFactory` to `org.apache.spark.internal.Logger & org.apache.spark.internal.LoggerFactory`, in order to completely `prohibit` importing `org.slf4j.Logger & org.slf4j.LoggerFactory` in java code later.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo enhance Apache Spark's logging system by implementing structured logging.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Pass GA.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-05-05T12:55:08Z","updated_at":"2024-08-23T09:35:13Z","closed_at":"2024-05-07T20:08:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"31204aa6d8660ec93a58deda7e0b50b223fde49a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46390/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46390/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/46390/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4943ec387c6f720825875069954f8e73f073abb1","head":{"label":"panbingkun:core_java_sl","ref":"core_java_sl","sha":"4943ec387c6f720825875069954f8e73f073abb1","user":{"login":"panbingkun","id":15246973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQ2OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15246973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun","html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":481429011,"node_id":"R_kgDOHLIGEw","name":"spark","full_name":"panbingkun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"panbingkun","id":15246973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQ2OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15246973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun","html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to run `k8s-integration-tests` only in PR builder and Daily Python CIs. In other words, only the commit builder will skip it by default. \r\n\r\nPlease note that \r\n- K8s unit tests will be covered by the commit builder still.\r\n- All PR builders are not consuming ASF resources and they provide lots of test coverage everyday also.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo reduce GitHub Action usage to meet ASF INFRA policy.\r\n- https://infra.apache.org/github-actions-policy.html\r\n\r\n    > All workflows MUST have a job concurrency level less than or equal to 20. This means a workflow cannot have more than 20 jobs running at the same time across all matrices.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual review.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-05-05T02:18:25Z","updated_at":"2024-05-08T21:31:54Z","closed_at":"2024-05-05T05:55:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"204b62e175c50d8fe8aa86d3461cbacd1dd13ad3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1982110661,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMTEwNjYx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/INFRA","name":"INFRA","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46388/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46388/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/46388/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5f0544d85d339229e9687d3d6b77114062b6294e","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-48132","ref":"SPARK-48132","sha":"5f0544d85d339229e9687d3d6b77114062b6294e","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":677218341,"node_id":"R_kgDOKF2IJQ","name":"spark","full_name":"dongjoon-hyun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun/spark","description":"Apache

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently there are two MDC keys for task name:\r\n* `mdc.taskName`, which is introduced in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28801. Before the change, it was `taskName`.\r\n* `task_name`: introduce from the structured logging framework project. \r\n\r\nTo make the MDC keys unified, this PR renames the `mdc.taskName` as `task_name`. This MDC is showing frequently in logs when running Spark application.\r\nBefore change:\r\n```\r\n\"context\":{\"mdc.taskName\":\"task 19.0 in stage 0.0 (TID 19)”}\r\n```\r\nafter change\r\n```\r\n\"context\":{“task_name\":\"task 19.0 in stage 0.0 (TID 19)”}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n1. Make the MDC names consistent\r\n2. Minor upside: this will allow users to query task names with `SELECT * FROM logs where context.task_name = ...`.  Otherwise, querying with `context.mdc.task_name` will result in an analysis exception. Users will have to query with `context['mdc.task_name']`\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo really. The MDC key is used by developers for debugging purpose.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nManual test\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes an issue where `BitwiseCount` / `bit_count` of boolean inputs would cause codegen to generate syntactically invalid Java code that does not compile, triggering errors like\r\n\r\n```\r\n java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException: org.codehaus.commons.compiler.CompileException: File 'generated.java', Line 41, Column 11: Failed to compile: org.codehaus.commons.compiler.CompileException: File 'generated.java', Line 41, Column 11: Unexpected token \"if\" in primary\r\n```\r\n\r\nEven though this code has test cases in `bitwise.sql` via the query test framework, those existing test cases were insufficient to find this problem: I believe that is because the example queries were constant-folded using the interpreted path, leaving the codegen path without test coverage.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the codegen issue and adds explicit expression tests to ensure that the same tests run on both the codegen and interpreted paths.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFix a rare codegen to interpreted fallback issue, which may harm query performance.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded new test cases to BitwiseExpressionsSuite.scala, copied from the existing `bitwise.sql` query test case file.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a followup to https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/46254 . Instead of using object arrays when nulls are present, continue to use primitive arrays when appropriate. This PR sets the null bits appropriately for the primitive array copy.\r\n\r\nPrimitive arrays are faster than object arrays and won't create unnecessary objects.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis will improve performance and memory usage, when nulls are present in the `ColumnarArray`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nThis is expected to be faster when copying `ColumnarArray`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-05-03T22:06:33Z","updated_at":"2024-05-05T13:50:24Z","closed_at":"2024-05-05T13:50:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4d343a63e33bf58caea9eb605e1c848a802695e1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46372/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46372/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/46372/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ca162840ee6c7fbdc12669033ef37d3d0337b0bc","head":{"label":"gene-db:primitive-nulls","ref":"primitive-nulls","sha":"ca162840ee6c7fbdc12669033ef37d3d0337b0bc","user":{"login":"gene-db","id":77996944,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3OTk2OTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/77996944?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db","html_url":"https://github.com/gene-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":654336314,"node_id":"R_kgDOJwBhOg","name":"spark","full_name":"gene-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gene-db","id":77996944,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3OTk2OTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/77996944?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db","html_url":"https://github.com/gene-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gene-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gene-db/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new 128 bit hashing function based on Guava's solution. Bloom filter is now created based on hashing strategy, which is decided by the bit size of the Bloom Filter.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWhen the decided bit size by Bloom Filter is greater than Integer.MAX_VALUE, 32 bit hashing function wastes the bits which index is greater than Integer.MAX_VALUE.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, hashing function is decided by BloomFilter.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded UT for new hashing function. Manually tested the BloomFilter with N is near 500 million.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-05-03T20:59:59Z","updated_at":"2024-09-18T00:22:47Z","closed_at":"2024-09-18T00:22:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"33a4cf2ca6ddd8cceddcd35fe4f348bdb0e5c1e9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46370/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/46370/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/46370/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9436426248917395d6565abf6ce7a43ae2c75169","head":{"label":"batubond007:SPARK-47547_BloomFilter","ref":"SPARK-47547_BloomFilter","sha":"9436426248917395d6565abf6ce7a43ae2c75169","user":{"login":"batubond007","id":46222914,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MjIyOTE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46222914?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/batubond007","html_url":"https://github.com/batubond007","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/batubond007/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/batubond007/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/batubond007/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/batubond007/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/batubond007/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/batubond007/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/batubond007/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/batubond007/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/batubond007/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":793730643,"node_id":"R_kgDOL09eUw","name":"spark","full_name":"batubond007/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"batubond007","id":46222914,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MjIyOTE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46222914?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/batubond007","html_url":"https://github.com/batubond007","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/batubond007/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/batubond007/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/batubond007/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/batubond007/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/batubond007/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/batubond007/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/batubond007/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/batubond007/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/batubond007/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/batubond007/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn PySpark connect there is no access to JVM to call `queryExecution().optimizedPlan.stats`. So, there is no way to get information about size in bytes from plan except parsing by regexps an output of `explain`. This PR is trying to fill that gap by providing `sizeInBytesApproximation` method to JVM, PySpark Classic and PySpark Connect APIs. Under the hood it is just a call to `queryExecution().optimizedPlan.stats.sizeInBytes`. JVM and PySpark Classic APIs were updated just to have a parity.\r\n\r\n1. Update of `Dataset.scala` in JVM connect by adding a new API\r\n2. Update of `Dataset.scala` in JVM classic by adding a new API\r\n3. Update `dataframe.py` in sql by adding signature and doc of a new API\r\n4. Update `dataframe.py` in connect by adding an implementation of a new API\r\n5. Update `dataframe.py` in classic by adding an implementation of a new API\r\n6. Update `base.proto` in part `AnalyzeRequest` / `AnalyzeResponse` by adding new message\r\n7. Generate new py-files from proto\r\n8. Update `SparkConnectAnalyzeHandler` by extending `match` and adding call to `queryExecution`\r\n9. Update `SparkConnectClient` by adding a new method that build a new request\r\n10. Update `SparkSession` by adding a call to client and parsing a response\r\n11. Add/update corresponding tests\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo provide to PySpark Connect users an ability to get in runtime the DataFrame size estimation without forcing them to parse string-output of `df.explain`. Other changes are needed to have a parity across Connect / Classic and PySpark / JVM Spark.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nOnly a new API. The new API is mostly for PySpark Connect users.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBecause the actual logic is in `queryExecution` I added tests only for syntax / calls. In tests we are testing that for a dataframe the returned size is greater than zero.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n@grundprinzip We discussed that ticket with you, may you please make a look?

This means a workflow cannot have more than 20 jobs running at the same time across all matrices.\r\n\r\nAlthough `pandas` is an **optional** package in PySpark, this is essential for PySpark users and we have **6 test pipelines** which requires lots of resources. We need to optimize the job concurrently level to `less than or equal to 20` while keeping the test capability as much as possible.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/f450272a9aac812d735eb5f741eec1f6cf1c837c/dev/requirements.txt#L4-L8\r\n\r\n- pyspark-pandas\r\n- pyspark-pandas-slow\r\n-

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nError message template regex is now precompiled to avoid unnecessary work\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n`SparkRuntimeException` uses `SparkThrowableHelper`, which uses `ErrorClassesJsonReader` to create error message string from templates in `error-conditions.json`, but template regex is compiled on every `SparkRuntimeException` constructor invocation. This slows down error construction, in particular `UnivocityParser` + `FailureSafeParser`, where it's a hot path.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- `testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.errors.QueryExecutionErrorsSuite`\r\n- Manually checked csv parsing error\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR enables Spark Connect plugins to process `Relation`s and `Expression`s using `SparkConnectPlanner` on the server side and to create `DataFrame`s using `Relation`s on the client side. This has been difficult due to the shading of the protobuf libraries, which meant that Java classes generated for the plugin's Protobuf message usage different base classes than the Java classes for Spark's protobuf messages. This was previously worked around by adding methods that accept a byte array (containing a serialized protobuf message) instead of a protobuf message. Unfortunately, this was not scalable as a lot of methods (such as `DataTypeProtoConverter.toCatalystType`) did not have this alternative. Luckily, we can avoid having to do this as the generated Java classes are not shaded and can still be used from plugins. Instead, plugins should serialize their own version of the generated Java classes for Spark Connect's protobuf messages and then parse them using Spark's (using the `ConnectProtoUtils` added in this PR).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nEnable the development of Spark Connect plugins.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR makes `session` in `SparkConnectPlanner` public so that it can be accessed by Spark Connect plugins. This method was public before but was made private.
