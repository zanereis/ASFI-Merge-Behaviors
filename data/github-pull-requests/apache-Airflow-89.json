(to be discussed later).\r\n\r\nAlso, this PR removes all the steps which setup python using `actions/setup-python@v4`, because of a bug in the action (actions/setup-python#705). As a workaround, I pre-installed python in the runner docker image, we can revert this change after fixing the bug, or keep it based on the performance of the runner.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an

the latest pip can enter into a long loop of backtracking when trying to find latest \"good\" set of dependencies with eager upgrade. This happened on August 10th 2023 with aiobotocore causing backtracking.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a complete set of tools and instructions that can help in such cases and figure out which newly released dependency causes backtracking.\r\n\r\nThe toolset consists of:\r\n\r\n* adding timeout on the image build, so that it can fail before the job timeout and provide useful instructions what to do\r\n\r\n* adding `ci find-backtracking-candidates` that allows to identify the packages released after the last successful constraint update that could be the reason for backtracking\r\n\r\n* running the `find-backtracking-candidates` command in the CI when timeout occurs - this will help to see the candidates as early as possible - at the first build that will fail with timeout. This should help with narrowing down the root cause much faster\r\n\r\n* adding detailed explanation why we have the problem and how to deal with it step-by-step, including example based on the August 2023 backtracking issue with aiobotocore\r\n\r\n* finally removing `--empty-image` switch and pushing empty images in CI. This was an attempt to speed up waiting for image in case the image failed, but what it did, it has hidden the failures of the images when they failed. It does not really add value any more, since \"image waiting\" is now always done using small public runners, waiting till timeout for those is not a big issue.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

this kind of dag if you clear w1 downstream, then w2 is also cleared (since it's downstream, of course)\r\n\r\n```python\r\n    s1 >> w1 >> [w2, t1]\r\n    s1 >> t1\r\n    s2 >> t2\r\n    s2 >> w2 >> t2\r\n```\r\n<img width=\"886\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/airflow/assets/15932138/21230da2-2854-4a46-8d53-7ed6d7899fa3\">\r\n\r\nBut see here, w2 has its own setup and teardown, which are not also downstream of s1.  We need to make sure that s2 and t2 are also cleared.  Previously this wasn't happening, and this PR fixes that.\r\n\r\nAs this dag helps illustrate, we have to check setups for each downstream task, since we can't assume that its setups are also downstream of the object task.\r\n\r\nTo avoid the need to recurse to arbitrary depth for setups of setups, we make clear here that a setup cannot have a setup.  A setup can *come after* another setup, but it won't *be* a setup for the setup (and what's at stake is just the clearing behavior).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAdditional notes...\r\n\r\nI created an intermediate set `also_include_ids` because it's possible we'll hit the same tasks multiple times.  Operator is hashable, but the hash attrs are mutable so it feels icky to have a set of them.  Simpler with strings.  But I think it would be fine if anyone thinks it's better to just use the operators.\r\n\r\nYou may also notice that I added some logic, guarding a couple lines with `if not t.is_setup`.  This is to essentially say, a setup is assumed not to \"have\" a setup.  That is, one setup can come before another, but that's just precedence -- the one is not a setup \"for\" the other.\r\n\r\nThe reason I believe we must do this is, if we say that a setup can have another setup (or if a teardown can have a setup / teardown), then, that would mean that, when we encounter a setup in a downstream clear, we would have to recurse it for its upstream setups.  But this would be quite annoying, and it's not worth it because it's hard to imagine a valid use case for that.  So, while we have to reach out for the setups of downstream _work_ tasks, since we know we'll only get setups and teardowns, then we know we can stop there (since we've said that a setup and teardown can't _itself_ have a setup and teardown); thus we know we do not have to recurse further for more setups and teardowns to

PR is a hotfix for Airflow 2.7.0rc1 adding a configuration option so that the trigger form on UI can be displayed also for DAGs w/o `params` defined which was removed in #31583.\r\n\r\nHow to test?\r\n- Start Airflow Webserver on this PR\r\n- Check that form still displays (always) when triggering DAG \"example_bash_operator\" - as this has a param defined\r\n- Trigger the example_python_operator and see it starts w/o displaying UI\r\n- Stop airflow webserver and start it with `AIRFLOW__WEBSERVER__SKIP_TRIGGER_FORM_IF_NO_PARAM=False airflow webserver -d` and trigger the example_python_operator - See it displays the JSON entry form (again)\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2023-08-12 at 18-59-47

up on PR https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/32052/ the test connection is disabled in UI, API and CLI. \r\nThe API and CLI strictly check for the config value to be set as `Enabled` \r\nfor the functionality to be enabled, whereas the UI just checks that is it \r\nnot set to `Disabled`. As a result setting values to the config param \r\nother than `Disabled`, enables the button in the UI. Even though the \r\nbutton gets enabled, the API forbids it as there is a strict check in the \r\nAPI that the value is set to `Enabled` and only then allows, however,\r\n it makes sense to also strictly check in the UI that value is set to `Enabled`\r\nbefore enabling the button.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

This for example causes failure when you want to install 2.7.0rc1 and use celery executor when running \"start-airflow\". It's easy to make it work by adding `--airflow-extras celery` but it was not too obvious.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a few examples in relevant places of BREEZE, release and TESTING documentation to surface that you can add extras and that \"celery\" extra should be used with Celery Executor when you run `--use-airflow-version` for 2.7.0+.\r\n\r\nAlso removes some old `wrong` references to non-existing `--use-airflow-from-pypi` flag used for Airflow 1.10 (?)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

`render_template_fields` method of mapped operator needs to use database session object to render mapped fields, but it cannot get the session passed by @provide_session decorator, because it is used in derived classes and we cannot change the signature without impacting those classes.\r\n\r\nSo far it was done by creating new session in mapped_operator, but it has the drawback of creating an extra session while one is already created (remnder_template_fields is always run in the context of task run and it always has a session created already in _run_raw_task). It also causes problems in our tests where two opened database session accessed database at the same time and it cases sqlite exception on concurrent access and mysql error on running operations out of sync - likely when the same object was modified in both sessions.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the approach - rather than creating a new session in the mapped_operator, we are retrieving the session from one stored by the _run_raw_task. It is done by context manager and adequate protection has been added to make sure that:\r\n\r\na) the call is made within the context manager\r\nb) context manageer is never initialized twice in the same\r\n   call stack\r\n\r\nAfter this change, resources used by running task will be smaller, and mapped tasks will not always open 2 DB sesions.\r\n\r\nFixes: #33178\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

2 PR: https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/31389, https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/31390\r\n\r\nRefactor the KPO to include istio support. Addressing all the feedback given by others such as: \r\n- removing extra parameter in KPO, and add logic to programatically check whether `istio-proxy` is injected\r\n- Use `curl localhost:15020/quitquitquit` to kill the sidecar when istio is enabled, if istio is not enabled it will fallback to using API call `delete_namespaced_pod`\r\n- No new element was added in `OnFinishAction`. Developers can use existing arguments and the operator will check if sidecar is injected, and use different methods to kill the pod depending on whether sidecar is injected or not\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-11T04:55:52Z","updated_at":"2023-08-26T16:01:01Z","closed_at":"2023-08-23T21:17:55Z","merged_at":"2023-08-23T21:17:55Z","merge_commit_sha":"75ce4d1923d65df339d0fc6332c990687796c79b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"jedcunningham","id":66968678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2OTY4Njc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66968678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham","html_url":"https://github.com/jedcunningham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"hussein-awala","id":21311487,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzExNDg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21311487?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala","html_url":"https://github.com/hussein-awala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1697155831,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjk3MTU1ODMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:providers","name":"area:providers","color":"d4c5f9","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2504183113,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTA0MTgzMTEz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:cncf-kubernetes","name":"provider:cncf-kubernetes","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"Kubernetes
