is the sketch of this proposal:\r\n\r\n1. When it is time to send the txn markers, only look for the leader node of the partition once instead of retrying, and if that information is not available, it means the partition is highly likely been removed since it was in the cache before. In this case, we just remove the partition from the metadata object and skip putting into the corresponding queue, and if all partitions' leader broker are non-available, complete this delayed operation to proceed to write the complete txn log entry.\r\n\r\n2. If the leader id is unknown from the cache but the corresponding node object with the listener name is not available, it means that the leader is likely unavailable right now. Put it into a separate queue and let sender thread retry fetching its metadata again each time upon draining the queue.\r\n\r\nOne caveat of this approach is the delete-and-recreate case, and the argument is that since all the messages are deleted anyways when deleting the topic-partition, it does not matter whether the markers are on the log partitions or not.","created_at":"2017-05-23T23:32:16Z","updated_at":"2017-11-06T22:44:32Z","closed_at":"2017-05-30T21:58:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"db85945f070acb0e447350db86682fab2eaa6280","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/3130/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/3130/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/3130/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/9629f33e6f1ec142fa5571f422cb7cd9fc79563c","head":{"label":"guozhangwang:K5202-handle-topic-deletion","ref":"K5202-handle-topic-deletion","sha":"9629f33e6f1ec142fa5571f422cb7cd9fc79563c","user":{"login":"guozhangwang","id":10729597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzI5NTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10729597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":39164613,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTE2NDYxMw==","name":"kafka","full_name":"guozhangwang/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"guozhangwang","id":10729597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzI5NTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10729597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang/kafka","description":"Mirror

ticket is all about ControllerContext initialization and teardown. The key points are:\r\n1. we should teardown ControllerContext during resignation instead of waiting on election to fix it up. A heapdump shows that the former controller keeps pretty much all of its ControllerContext state laying around.\r\n2. we don't properly teardown/reset ControllerContext.partitionsBeingReassigned. This can cause problems when the former controller becomes re-elected as controller at a later point in time.\r\n\r\nSuppose a partition assignment is initially R0. Now suppose a reassignment R1 gets stuck during controller C0 and an admin tries to \"undo\" R1 (by deleting /admin/partitions_reassigned, deleting /controller, and submitting another reassignment specifying R0). The new controller C1 may succeed with R0. If the controller moves back to C0, it will then reattempt R1 even though that partition reassignment has been cleared from zookeeper prior to shifting the controller back to C0. This results in the actual partition reassignment in zookeeper being unexpectedly changed back to R1.","created_at":"2017-05-23T06:40:52Z","updated_at":"2017-05-23T23:31:03Z","closed_at":"2017-05-23T23:31:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"eeabeeac73e14df14254a19faf30586ea6cd389d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/3122/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/3122/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/3122/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/256ff84b8263295f393b1c9eb0fdcdc35e5d67e8","head":{"label":"onurkaraman:KAFKA-5310","ref":"KAFKA-5310","sha":"256ff84b8263295f393b1c9eb0fdcdc35e5d67e8","user":{"login":"onurkaraman","id":529976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyOTk3Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/529976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman","html_url":"https://github.com/onurkaraman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":39984426,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTk4NDQyNg==","name":"kafka","full_name":"onurkaraman/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"onurkaraman","id":529976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyOTk3Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/529976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman","html_url":"https://github.com/onurkaraman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onurkaraman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/onurkaraman/kafka","description":"Mirror

this patch the consumer would return the cached offsets for partitions in its current assignment. This worked when all the offset commits went through the consumer. \r\n\r\nWith KIP-98, offsets can be committed transactionally through the producer. This means that relying on cached positions in the consumer returns incorrect information: since commits go through the producer, the cache is never updated. \r\n\r\nHence we need to update the `KafkaConsumer.committed` method to always lookup the server for the last committed offset to ensure it gets the correct information every

this patch, offset commits are always materialized according to the order of the commit records in the offsets topic. \r\n\r\nBefore this patch, transactional offset commits were materialized in transaction order. However, the log cleaner will always preserve the record with the greatest offset. This meant that if there was a mix of offset commits from a consumer and a transactional producer, then it we would switch from transactional order to offset order after cleaning, resulting in an inconsistent state.\r\n","created_at":"2017-05-20T00:02:37Z","updated_at":"2017-05-23T16:48:38Z","closed_at":"2017-05-23T16:48:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"44099d4a75b3d7509797a7e511ce72a54b8ca425","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/3108/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/3108/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/3108/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/cb423e1c67fe7362631409d03a6870c98b4071d6","head":{"label":"apurvam:KAFKA-5247-materialize-committed-offsets-in-offset-order","ref":"KAFKA-5247-materialize-committed-offsets-in-offset-order","sha":"cb423e1c67fe7362631409d03a6870c98b4071d6","user":{"login":"apurvam","id":830220,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMDIyMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/830220?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurvam","html_url":"https://github.com/apurvam","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurvam/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurvam/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurvam/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurvam/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurvam/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurvam/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurvam/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurvam/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurvam/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":69067896,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2OTA2Nzg5Ng==","name":"kafka","full_name":"apurvam/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apurvam","id":830220,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMDIyMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/830220?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurvam","html_url":"https://github.com/apurvam","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurvam/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurvam/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurvam/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurvam/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurvam/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurvam/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurvam/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurvam/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apurvam/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apurvam/kafka","description":"Mirror

Added a boolean `allow_auto_topic_creation` to MetadataRequest and\r\nbumped the protocol version to V4.\r\n\r\n- When connecting to brokers older than 0.11.0.0, the `allow_auto_topic_creation`\r\nfield won't be considered, so we send a metadata request for all topics\r\nto keep the behavior consistent.\r\n\r\n- Set `allow_auto_topic_creation` to false in the new AdminClient and\r\nStreamsKafkaClient (which exists for the purpose of creating topics\r\nmanually); set it to true everywhere else for now. Other clients will eventually\r\nrely on client-side auto topic creation, but that’s not there yet.\r\n\r\n- Add `allowAutoTopicCreation` field to `Metadata`, which is used by\r\n`DefaultMetadataUpdater`. This is not strictly needed for the new\r\n`AdminClient`, but it avoids surprises if it ever adds a topic to `Metadata`\r\nvia `setTopics` or

on patch from @jkreps in [this JIRA ticket](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-1955).\r\n\r\n- [ ] Get some unit tests that would cover disk-backed usage\r\n- [ ] Do some manual performance testing of this usage and understand the impact on throughput.\r\n- [ ] Do some manual testing of failure cases (i.e. if the broker goes down for 30 seconds we should be able to keep taking writes) and observe how well the producer handles the catch up time when it has a large backlog to get rid of.\r\n- [ ] Add a new configuration for the producer to enable this, something like use.file.buffers=true/false.\r\n- [ ] Add documentation that covers these new options.\r\n\r\nI've brought the patch into sync with trunk. Testing is next, which I've started on. I am flexible on how this can be implemented.","created_at":"2017-05-18T01:30:07Z","updated_at":"2019-06-26T09:28:27Z","closed_at":"2017-06-21T19:42:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a50a08d29965d034716ab2da390655ce87229a01","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/3083/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/3083/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/3083/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/2e3e08ed7853255c699bed20a32a79f655f5b8de","head":{"label":"blbradley:kafka-disk-buffer","ref":"kafka-disk-buffer","sha":"2e3e08ed7853255c699bed20a32a79f655f5b8de","user":{"login":"blbradley","id":1435085,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzUwODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1435085?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/blbradley","html_url":"https://github.com/blbradley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blbradley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blbradley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blbradley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blbradley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blbradley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blbradley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blbradley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blbradley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blbradley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":91597951,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5MTU5Nzk1MQ==","name":"kafka","full_name":"blbradley/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"blbradley","id":1435085,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzUwODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1435085?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/blbradley","html_url":"https://github.com/blbradley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blbradley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blbradley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blbradley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blbradley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blbradley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blbradley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blbradley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blbradley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blbradley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/blbradley/kafka","description":"Mirror

Grab the read lock right before trying to append to local txn log, and until the local append returns; this is to avoid the scenario that the epoch has actually changed when we are appending to local log (e.g. emigration followed by immigration).\r\n\r\n3. only watch on txnId instead of txnId and txnPartitionId in the txn marker purgatory, and disable reaper thread, as we can now safely clear all

removes the need to force object initialisation via hacks to register\r\nthe relevant Yammer metrics during start-up.\r\n\r\nIt also works around issues caused by tests that delete JVM-wide

Without this\r\nchange, they would never be registered again. After this change, they will\r\nbe registered again during KafkaServer start-up.\r\n\r\nIt would be even better not to rely on JVM side singleton metrics (like we do\r\nfor Kafka Metrics), but that's

PR addresses two improvements:\r\n\r\n[KAFKA-5235 GetOffsetShell: retrieve offsets for all given topics and partitions with single request to the broker](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-5235)\r\n[KAFKA-5234 GetOffsetShell: retrieve offsets for multiple topics with single request](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-5234)\r\n\r\n1. Previous implementation used SimpleConsumer to get offsets and old Producer API to get topic/partition metadata. Previous implementation determined a leader broker for each partition and then requested the leader for offsets. In total, it did as many requests to the broker as the number of partitions (plus a request to Zookeeper for metadata).\r\nNew implementation `kafka-get-offsets.sh` uses KafkaConsumer API. It makes at most two requests to the broker: 1) to query existing topics and partitions, 2) to grab all requested offsets. New implementation correctly handles non-existing topics and partitions asked by user:\r\n\r\n> kafka-get-offsets.sh --bootstrap-servers vm:9092 --topics AAA,ZZZ --partitions 0,1\r\n> AAA:0:7\r\n> AAA:1:Partition not found\r\n> ZZZ:0:Topic not found\r\n\r\n2. Previously, user could get offsets for one topic only. Now user can get offsets for many topics at once:\r\n`kafka-get-offsets.sh --bootstrap-servers vm:9092 --topics AAA,ZZZ`\r\nMoreover, now user is able to retrieve offsets for _all_ topics - this is the default when no topics specified:\r\n`kafka-get-offsets.sh --bootstrap-servers vm:9092`\r\nThanks to this feature, there is no need anymore to retrieve all topics by means of `kafka-topics.sh`.\r\nWhen no topics specified, the new `kafka-get-offsets.sh` tool takes into account only user-level topics and ignores Kafka-internal topics (i.e. consumer offsets). This behavior can be altered via a special command line argument:\r\n`kafka-get-offsets.sh --bootstrap-servers vm:9092 --include-internal-topics`\r\n\r\n3. New `kafka-get-offsets.sh` tool is consistent with other console tools with respect to command line argument names. In addition, `kafka-get-offsets.sh` tool gives the possibility to pass an arbitrary setting to KafkaConsumer via `--consumer-property` argument. Old command line arguments are marked as deprecated with appropriate warning messages.\r\n\r\nI hope, now `kafka-get-offsets.sh` is easier in use and gives performance improvement.\r\n@junrao I suppose you may want to review.","created_at":"2017-05-14T18:40:33Z","updated_at":"2020-10-24T06:31:16Z","closed_at":"2020-10-24T06:31:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9d99abca3ddefcb89470af042bf97c270035a8d0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/3051/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/3051/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/3051/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/63973679f2db6262974b835fdc225e9c23e4eca8","head":{"label":"tashoyan:trunk","ref":"trunk","sha":"63973679f2db6262974b835fdc225e9c23e4eca8","user":{"login":"tashoyan","id":17761745,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzYxNzQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17761745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tashoyan","html_url":"https://github.com/tashoyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tashoyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tashoyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tashoyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tashoyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tashoyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tashoyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tashoyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tashoyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tashoyan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":89807928,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4OTgwNzkyOA==","name":"kafka","full_name":"tashoyan/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tashoyan","id":17761745,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzYxNzQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17761745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tashoyan","html_url":"https://github.com/tashoyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tashoyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tashoyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tashoyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tashoyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tashoyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tashoyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tashoyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tashoyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tashoyan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tashoyan/kafka","description":"Mirror

Fix flakiness of `testBrokerTopicMetricsUnregisteredAfterDeletingTopic` by not\r\nconsuming messages.
