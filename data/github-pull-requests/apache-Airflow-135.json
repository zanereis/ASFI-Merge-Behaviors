there is a parse error in a DAG the zombie cleanup request never ran,\nwhich resulted in the TI never leaving running state and just\ncontinually being detected as a zombie.\n\n(Prior to AIP-45 landing, this bug/behaviour resulted in a DAG with a\nparse error never actually leaving the queued state.)\n\nThe fix here is to _always_ make sure we run `ti.handle_failure` when we\nare given a request, even if we can't load the DAG. To _try_ and work as\nwell as we can, we try to load the serialized_dag if we can, but in\ncases where we can't for whatever reason we also make sure\nTaskInstance.handle_failure is able to operate even when `self.task`

2.2 added a few deprecations and made a few changes that\r\nmade our tests stop working. Those were really test problems not\r\nreal application problems (there were no breaking changes in 2.2):\r\n\r\n* new deprecation warnings produced\r\n* Flask app cannot be reused in multiple tests\r\n* The way how session lifetime is calculated makes test fail\r\n  if freezegun is frozen using Pendulum datetime rather than the\r\n  stdlib ones\r\n\r\nThis is an early warning for the future as the deprecation\r\nwarnings make us aware that Flask 2.3 is breaking. So this PR\r\nfixes the 2.2 compatibility but at the same time limits Flask to\r\n< 2.3 with appropriate information when the limit can be removed.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

The \"I'm determined to fix SLAs\" PR\r\n\r\nOK, so #25147 made a start in this direction. Summing up the, er, summary from _that_ MR, the problem was that SLA callbacks could keep occuring, and prevent the dag processor manager from ever processing more than 2 or 3 dags in the queue before the SLA callbacks re-upped and went to the front of the queue.\r\n\r\nUnder the new behaviour, the SLA callbacks went to the _back_ of the queue. This guaranteed that the queue would be processed at least once. However, it turns out that dags on disk would only be re-added to the queue _once the queue was empty_. But with SLA callbacks arriving All. The. Time. the queue would never drain, and we'd never re-read dags from disk. So if you updated the dag file, you'd have to bounce the scheduler to pick up the change, and then it would process all non-SLA-generating DAGs exactly once. And then you'd need to bounce again.\r\n\r\n### Related Issues\r\n\r\nCloses #15596 (I hope!)\r\n\r\n# I've almost certainly missed some steps.\r\n\r\nBefore I go into a bit more detail about the change, I'd like to acknowledge that as a (very) small time contributor to the project, I'm not familiar with all the done things when making more radical changes. In particular, I assume there's more doc changes needed than just a newsfragment. I've added a config flag, some metrics, _and_ the behaviour of the queue processing has subtly changed (for the better I hope!)\r\n\r\nI'd very much appreciate someone(s) leaving a comment :point_down: telling me what else I need to do in terms of docs etc.\r\n\r\n# TL;DR\r\n\r\nI mean, I see your point. Skip to the bottom for the summary.\r\n\r\n# Pay attention, here comes the science bit\r\n\r\nOk, so to briefly recap the queue behaviour prior to this change:\r\n1. The scheduler spins up.\r\n2. The worker loop starts.\r\n3. It scans the disk to create a list of all known files. _It does not add these files to the queue_.\r\n4. If the queue is empty (on start up it will be) then all known files are added to the queue.\r\n5. It then spins up dag processors (via multiprocessing or in-line, depending on set up) to consume the first N entries in the queue (where N is a function of config settings, and includes a count of any files currently being processed from a previous pass of the loop)\r\n6. It then goes back to step 2.\r\n\r\n- Note that Step 3 is re-run periodically based on a time interval set in config (`dag_dir_list_interval`). It does not require that the queue be empty. Any changes to the set of files on disk e.g. dags being deleted will cause the manager to remove dags from the queue.\r\n- After a few iterations of the loop, the contents of the queue are processed, and step 4 kicks in, and the dag files present on disk are re-added to the queue again.\r\n    - The default config is to do this no more than once every 30 seconds (`min_file_process_interval`), so if your dag files only take 10 seconds to process, there will be 20 seconds of idle time, but if your dag files take a minute to process, then the manager will be permanently busy, because as soon as the queue drains, it'll be well past time to reload the queue from disk.\r\n    - This only works if the queue _actually empties_ - as foreshadowed above, if the queue never empties (because SLAs) then step 4 will never kick in, and we'll never reload the queue. Step 3 will ensure that within a short interval any deleted dags are removed from the queue (should they happen to be one of the ones generating SLAs) but updated and newly added dag files will not be picked up.\r\n    - To be clear, this is the problem I alluded to in my comments at the end of the previous MR after it got merged.\r\n\r\nLocally, I tested a hacky fix whereby on receipt of a SLA callback I still add the callback, but I simply _didn't add the dag to the queue_ (it's a one-line change - extremely simple!). This works, but means that SLA callbacks are only processed when the queue drains, and is reprocessed (because then all dags are added to the queue, guaranteeing that we will process any outstanding SLA callbacks). However, If someone has specified a large wait time between loading dags from disk, this will affect how timely the SLA alerts are, which is fine for me, because I don't do that, but I wasn't getting a \"this will be fine for everyone\" vibe from the change (I did say it was hacky!).\r\n\r\nAlso, there's another catch. While the problem is much more prevalent with SLAs, these are not the only callbacks. I could envisage a situation where someone configures a dag with a very small interval (e.g. a dag run every 10 seconds). While I think this is a much more theoretical problem that might not ever exist in the wild - this isn't really the use case Airflow is intended for - the upshot would be that a dag generating lots of dag callbacks would be spamming the queue. And those callbacks still go to the _front_ of the queue, i.e. you're back to the situation I tried to solve in the previous MR!\r\n\r\n# I don't think that word means what you think it means\r\n\r\nI decided that fundamentally, part of the the problem was that the queue should be FIFO. And it wasn't. But if I made it FIFO, then the higher priority DAG callbacks would have to wait their turn behind the dag files loaded from disk, and I'm pretty sure stopping that would eliminate some of the speed-ups Airflow 2 was trumpeted as solving. Airflow 1 used to have on average a 15 second gap (= 30/2) between one task completing and the downstream tasks being scheduled, because once the task completed, you had to wait for the manager to drain the queue, add the files to the queue from disk, and then process the dag. (And that's assuming you could even process all your dags in &lt;30 seconds...). In Airflow 2, because of the dag callbacks, the gap between downstream tasks being scheduled is usually sub-second.\r\n\r\nI didn't want to be the guy who accidentally breaks _that_ particular speed up. :scream: \r\n\r\nSo I did two things:\r\n\r\n## Thing 1: Tackling the FIFO issue aka gazumping callbacks.\r\n1. I split the existing queue into two: a priority queue, and a standard queue. the priority queue is drained before the standard queue.\r\n2. You can probably guess what goes where, but: the dag callbacks go into the priority queue, while the SLAs callbacks and dags found on disk are added to the standard queue.\r\n3. **Both queues are FIFO.** This means that rapidly updating dags can't gazump other slightly-less-rapidly updating dags, because they go to the back. Of course, most of the time, there's only one dag with callbacks in the priority queue, and there's no material change in behaviour. \r\n4. Hypothetically, the priority queue could be permanently busy. If this happens, it'll be like it was with the SLAs; the standard queue would never get a look-in, and we'd stop processing new/updated dags.\r\n5. So **I also added a new config param**, This is called `max_file_process_interval` and it's the dual to the existing `min_file_process_interval`. It guarantees that if you do happen to have a permanently busy priority queue, eventually we'll take a breather, and process the files on disk anyway.\r\n6. By default, this flag is set to 120 seconds. Setting it to zero disables it, i.e. you can have a permanently busy priority queue.\r\n7. I am acutely aware / wary of the fact that this separation-of-the-queues-plus-config-param is purely solving a problem that is (for me at least) purely a theoretically-possible issue. I've never seen it, but I don't think it's premature optimisation to tackle it in this change.\r\n\r\n## Thing 2: Handling the fact that SLAs stop the standard queue from ever being empty.\r\n1. As noted ... somewhere ... above, a hacky fix was to simply stop adding dags to the queue on SLA callback. But this wasn't perfect for people who don't happen to use airflow the way I do.\r\n2. So, the first half of Thing 2 was to make the standard queue FIFO. This is effectively upholding the change from the previous MR; SLA callbacks simply get treated the same as dags loaded from disk, and have to wait their turn.\r\n3. The next bit was to then add a `set` which tracked which dag files in the queue were still outstanding from the last refresh from disk. Once the queue was refreshed from disk, we'd work through every file eventually (because FIFO), and at that point the set would be empty, even if the queue wasn't (because SLAs).\r\n4. Once the set was empty, we'd refresh the queue with dags found on disk.\r\n5. Some of those dags from disk _might already be in the queue due to SLAs_ but we don't care; this is a good thing as it means loading dags from disk doesn't push existing SLAs to the back of the line. \r\n\r\n# Notes\r\n\r\nThis doesn't materially change _how_ SLAs work; they are generated and consumed the same as before. It just means that we reliably consume the alerts once generated without breaking the rest of the system. In my experience at least, adding SLAs would simply cause the system to stop processing dag updates (as per #15596).\r\n\r\nIn particular, I don't address issues with SLA timestamps (as raised by #22532), nor do I deal with other problems (e.g. now SLAs fire reliably, I have noticed that they fire during catch-up, and that the same alert can fire multiple times).\r\n\r\nThis is not because I think the current approach is perfect (like everyone else on the internet, I Have Thoughts on how it could be improved, given infinite time) but rather it is a sad-but-true fact that I don't have the time to take on a big project. So I am going to continue with my current approach of tinkering round the edges; and if the remaining issues are minor enough to live with, I'm just going to live with them (at least for now).\r\n\r\n# Summary: I'm from the UK; politely waiting in line is what we do best.\r\n\r\n- Separation of manager's `_file_path_queue` to `_std_file_path_queue` (for SLAs and dags loaded from disk) and `priority_file_path_queue` (for DAG call backs)\r\n- New `max_file_process_interval` config to ensure files are read from disk every so often, even if the priority queue is always busy\r\n- Dags from disk will be added to std queue even if the std queue is still busy with SLAs.\r\n- Some extra stats/metrics to track queue depths / progress\r\n- Tests updated to reflect

seems that the problem with runnig an emulated Python with rosetta\r\non Macs M1/M2 might be more widespread. There are various scenarios\r\nwhere people could get the emulated Python:\r\n\r\n* Installing application with pre-bundled Intel Python (Intellj/PyCharm)\r\n* Installing older Python via anaconda\r\n* Transferring the configuration from Intel based Macs (yes, Apple\r\n  will NOT warn you when you are copying brew, python and other\r\n  binaries during the Apple-blessed \"Transfer my Mac\").\r\n\r\nThis means that proably quite a number of people currently runs\r\nIntel, emulated version of Python on their shiny new M1s which\r\nslows the Python (and thus Airflow) more than 10x.\r\n\r\nWe alredy had a warning about it, but now it is more explicit, telling\r\nthe user what exactly should be checked and how to rectify from\r\nthe situation (basically nuking the development environment including\r\nbrew and restarting from scratch is the best option you have).\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

Python version of Breeze had only a handful of commands,\r\nwhile moving from Bash, but we are close to completion of the\r\ntransition and the number of commands grew quite a lot bringit it\r\non par to the commands we used to have in the Bash version of Breeze.\r\n\r\nHowever, only a small subset of the commands is actually useful to\r\naverage developer, most of the more advanced commands are used in\r\nspecific circumstances (release management, configuring Breeze\r\nonce or rebuilding the image or even runing non-interactive test\r\nsession are rarely used. Therefore it makes much more sense to\r\nsurface the common commands as the top-level commands and move\r\nthe less frequent commands to subcommands to move them out from\r\nthe main help page.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the BREEZE.rst documentation got a little messy\r\nduring the move and this is the right time to structure it similarly\r\nto breeze commands:\r\n\r\n* prerequisites and installation\r\n* first-time configuration\r\n* regular task description\r\n* more advanced tasks grupped in the same subcommands as in Breeze\r\n* diving deeper into details of Breeze implentation for those\r\n  who wish to understand how Breeze works under-the-hood\r\n\r\nAliases for the common commands that users could already get used to\r\nwere created, and deprecation warnings are printed in casee those\r\ncommands are used (guiding the user to the new commands to use).\r\n\r\nLess frequently used options for shell command are still available\r\nin `shell` but they have been removed from the default command to\r\nremove clutter. You can still used them by explicitly specifying\r\nthe `shell` commnd.\r\n\r\nConfiguration for rich click has been separated out from the\r\ncommand group implementation to separate packages. This allows\r\nfor less problems with circular imports - none of the commands\r\nare needed when rich-click configuration is being prepared, which\r\nhappens before main `click` command is parsed, which allows to\r\nrun imports of the \"code\" as late as possible.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

PR addresses #25104\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Changes\r\n\r\n## 1. JSON secrets do not need to be URL-encoded when `full_url_mode=False`.\r\n\r\n^ The whole reason for this PR. This is the main behavior that is being implemented.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, this behavior is implemented for when `get_connection()` is called. This method returns a `Optional[Connection]` object. The `Connection()` can be built either using a `uri=?`, or with kwargs corresponding with the parts of the URI, e.g. `host=?`, `port=?`, etc. In the former case, URL-encoding is required; in the latter case, it is not.\r\n\r\nUsers will receive a DeprecationWarning if the code detects that their secrets are URL-encoded (more on that in section 2 below). In most cases, the user should be able to simply decode their secret and everything will continue working normally.\r\n\r\nI tried to make this change, as well as the other changes, as quietly as possible for typical Airflow runtimes. Basically, if the user isn't doing anything weird, the only thing they will be required to do is change their secrets from being URL-encoded to decoded.\r\n\r\nTo support this behavior, a few additional things were either needed to be changed, or made a lot of sense to change. The rest of this message will describe what those additional changes are.\r\n\r\n## 2. Added `secret_values_are_urlencoded=?` kwarg for `SecretsManagerBackend.__init__`, albeit most users do not need to touch this.\r\n\r\n@potiuk suggested adding a kwarg for assisting in migration. I wanted to avoid this if necessary because it is very obtrusive and causes a negative user experience.\r\n\r\nIs it possible to avoid needing to reconfigure the secrets manager backend? Yes, in most cases!\r\n\r\nWhat I dicovered is that **if decoding the URL-encoded values is idempotent, the user needs to decode their secrets, but the `backend_kwargs` config option does not need to be adjusted.** The reason why idempotency obviates a need to touch the config is that idempotency means the intended value of the secret is unambiguous once the values are decoded. This is a pretty big win from a user experience perspective because adjusting the Airflow configuration can be a nuisance in practice (e.g. a developer might need to get a system administrator involved).\r\n\r\nI add a longer explanation in the comments for the code:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# When ``unquote(v) == v``, then removing unquote won't affect the user, regardless of\r\n# whether or not ``v`` is URL-encoded. For example, \"foo bar\" is not URL-encoded. But\r\n# because decoding it doesn't affect the value, then it will migrate safely when\r\n# ``unquote`` gets removed.\r\n#\r\n# When parameters are URL-encoded, but decoding is idempotent, we need to warn the user\r\n# to un-escape their secrets. For example, if \"foo%20bar\" is a URL-encoded string, then\r\n# decoding is idempotent because ``unquote(unquote(\"foo%20bar\")) == unquote(\"foo%20bar\")``.\r\n#\r\n# In the rare situation that value is URL-encoded but the decoding is _not_ idempotent,\r\n# this causes a major issue. For example, if \"foo%2520bar\" is URL-encoded, then decoding is\r\n# _not_ idempotent because ``unquote(unquote(\"foo%2520bar\")) != unquote(\"foo%2520bar\")``\r\n#\r\n# This causes a problem for migration because if the user decodes their value, we cannot\r\n# infer that is the case by looking at the decoded value (from our vantage point, it will\r\n# look to be URL-encoded.)\r\n#\r\n# So when this uncommon situation occurs, the user _must_ adjust the configuration and set\r\n# ``parameters_are_urlencoded`` to False to migrate safely. In all other cases, we do not\r\n# need the user to adjust this object to migrate; they can transition their secrets with\r\n# the default configuration.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe kwarg is needed in the very rare case that the kwarg is not idempotent, i.e. the string literal for the decoded secret contains a `%`. In this case, the user will need to manually set `secret_values_are_urlencoded` to `False`.\r\n\r\n## 3. Send DeprecationWarning in a niche situation for `get_conn_value()`.\r\n\r\n`get_conn_value()` is allowed to return a JSON as of 2.3.0.\r\n\r\nHowever, in the unlikely case that someone is both (1) using `get_conn_value()` directly, and (2) is using `full_url_mode=False`, we want to warn them that they will no longer receive a URL in the future.\r\n\r\n2. The base implementation of `get_connection()` will generate a `Connection` object when `get_conn_value()` returns a JSON-- or more conceptually, when the secret is a valid JSON.\r\n\r\n2. When `get_conn_value()` returns a JSON, `get_connection()` is able to create a `Connection` object from the JSON.\r\n   a. Crucially, this does _not_ require URL-encoding for the base Airflow APIs.\r\n\r\nThis is really challenging to do elegantly if the method `SecretsManagerBackend.get_conn_value()` needs to retain 100% backwards compatibility. By that I mean: if it is never allowed to return a JSON string representation of the secret.\r\n\r\nFor example, if `_get_secret()` returns a string `'{\"host\": \"foo\", \"conn_type\": \"postgres\", \"schema\": \"mydb\"}'`, then the current behavior is that `SecretsManagerBackend.get_conn_value()` will return a string `'postgres://:@foo/mydb'`.\r\n\r\nUnder the base class's implementation, `BaseSecretsBackend.get_conn_value()` _is_ allowed to return a JSON string. But `SecretsManagerBackend` _never_ does that. If the behavior of the overridden is relaxed to allow for JSON strings as per the base implementation, then this becomes a little easier to do without writing complete spaghetti.\r\n\r\nFor \"typical\" Airflow API usage there is no harm because `get_conn_value()` is not typically called directly. However, this is a pretty big package, and lots of people do lots of things you might not expect, so I opted to go with smoothly transitioning away from returning a URI.\r\n\r\n## 4. Deprecate `ast.literal_eval` (i.e. support for dict reprs) for JSON decoding.\r\n\r\nI want to be diplomatic, but I also want to get to the point, so please do not interpret this negatively. Here is the original code:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ntry:\r\n    secret_string = self._get_secret(self.connections_prefix, conn_id)\r\n    # json.loads gives error\r\n    secret = ast.literal_eval(secret_string) if secret_string else None\r\nexcept ValueError:  # 'malformed node or string: ' error, for empty conns\r\n    connection = None\r\n    secret = None\r\n```\r\n\r\n^ This is speculation, but upon review, it appears that `ast.literal_eval` may have been added to the PR because one of the test cases contains a trailing comma in a JSON, and the author forced the test to pass using `ast.literal_eval` instead of removing the trailing comma and using `json.loads`, which would be the more typical thing to do.\r\n\r\nThere are two reasons to remove `ast.literal_eval` and just use `json.loads`. The first reason is a bit more philosophical, which is that the API should not support an odd implementation and should not hand-hold for mistakes at this level of simplicity.\r\n\r\nThe second reason is to provide a little more consistency across the Airflow API:\r\n\r\n- `{'conn_type': 'postgres', 'host': 'postgres'}` is not a valid secret elsewhere in Airflow, but `{\"conn_type\": \"postgres\", \"host\": \"postgres\"}` is.\r\n- `get_conn_value()` is allowed to return a JSON string, but not a dict repr. When we migrate toward `get_conn_value()` returning a JSON string, we should discourage use of dict reprs.\r\n\r\nThe original PR that implemented the `ast.literal_eval()` approach (#15104) was primarily focused on adding more support for various aliases for keys. Overall, this a fine addition to the code. For various reasons, maintainers should be committed to retaining this feature. However, the use of `ast.literal_eval` was never part of the discussion for this specification; there was not a PR specifically devoted to migrating `json.loads` to `ast.literal_eval`.\r\n\r\n\r\nRemoving it also should not be disruptive to the vast majority of people, since:\r\n\r\n- The Secrets Manager UI defaults to parsing manually input key-value pairs as a JSON.\r\n- If you input a custom string that is a dict repr but not a JSON, the UI will show an error. It would be unusual for a user to submit this as a secret, since the user would be ignoring the UI's warnings. (I just tested and confirmed manually that this is the case by creating a secret that is `{'foo': 'bar'}`.)\r\n\r\n## 5. Support `extra` being either a JSON string or a dict\r\n\r\nAWS Secrets Manager allows for storage of arbitrary strings. For example, both of these are valid secrets to store within the Secrets Manager:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\"extra\": \"{\\\"foo\\\": \\\"bar\\\"}\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\"extra\": {\"foo\": \"bar\"}}\r\n```\r\n\r\nRight now, the former is supported but not the latter. There doesn't seem to be a good reason why the latter should not be supported, other than that the AWS UI will fail to parse key-value pairs. But it's still a valid secret!\r\n\r\n## 6. Added some type annotations.\r\n\r\nSome function signatures were missing type annotations, so I added them in. All of the type annotations for overridden methods adhere to the signatures from the base implementation of the class.","created_at":"2022-07-31T18:16:30Z","updated_at":"2022-08-08T14:10:08Z","closed_at":"2022-08-07T10:56:57Z","merged_at":"2022-08-07T10:56:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"ae7bf474109410fa838ab2728ae6d581cdd41808","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"mik-laj","id":12058428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDU4NDI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12058428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj","html_url":"https://github.com/mik-laj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1471852032,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDcxODUyMDMy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:amazon","name":"provider:amazon","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"AWS/Amazon

current EcsOperator is monolithic, does not have a hook, nor any sensors.  This PR adds an ECS hook, modifies the existing EcsOperator to use it, adds a handful of other operators and sensors.  The functionality of the existing EcsOperator was changed as little as possible.  A future refactor of  that operator might not be a bad idea, but adding the hook and sensors is the main goal of this PR.\r\n\r\nOther changes:\r\n - Moved some methods from the EcsOperator module into the new EcsHook module as that felt like a better home for them.\r\n - Removes some old code that has been deprecated for multiple major releases.  \r\n   - `airflow/contrib/operators/ecs_operator.py` was deprecated over 2 years ago\r\n   - `tests/providers/amazon/aws/operators/test_ecs_system.py` is also a few years old and not a proper system test by current standards.\r\n -  Deprecates the name `EcsOperator` in favor of `EcsRunTaskOperator` to match the standard naming conventions since there are now multiple ECS-related operators.\r\n\r\ncloses:

more compatibility and unification we have to decide the default behavior of SQL operators in terms of returning results.\r\n\r\nMy opinion is adding `handler` parameter and no Xcom push by default,

PR adds a missing import to the \"unit test for a custom operator\" code example. While this code example won't run on its own any way since `MyCustomOperator` isn't defined (and probably shouldn't be for simplicity), I noticed when applying this code to my own custom operator that an import for `DAG` was missing. This PR adds that back in, so the only missing import is for the user-added custom operator.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!
