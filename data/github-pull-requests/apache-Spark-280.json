As a result, there will be no match and the result will always be empty.\r\nSo for a pivot column of complex-types, we should:\r\n1) If the complex-type is not comparable (orderable), throw an Exception. It cannot be a pivot column.\r\n2) Otherwise, if it goes through the `PivotFirst` code path, `PivotFirst` should use a TreeMap instead of HashMap for such columns.\r\n\r\nThis PR has also reverted the walk-around in Analyzer that had been introduced to avoid this `PivotFirst` issue.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSinkProgress should report similar properties like SourceProgress as long as they are available for given Sink. Count of written rows is metric availble for all Sinks. Since relevant progress information is with respect to commited rows, ideal object to carry this info is WriterCommitMessage. For brevity the implementation will focus only on Sinks with API V2 and on Micro Batch mode. Implemention for Continuous mode will be provided at later date.\r\n\r\n### Before\r\n```\r\n{\"description\":\"org.apache.spark.sql.kafka010.KafkaSourceProvider@3c0bd317\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\n###

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nUpdate with a better fix:\r\nWith this fix, the offsets are scanned to determine the ranges. We ensure that the when we determine the range [fromOffset, untilOffset), untilOffset is always an offset with an existing record that we've been able to fetch at least once.\r\nThis logic is applied as soon as  allowNonConsecutiveOffsets is enabled.\r\nSince we scan all the record a first time, we use this to count the number of records. OffsetRange now contains the number of record in each partition and the rdd.count() is a free operation.\r\n\r\nIsolation level of uncomitted read is unsafe: untilOffset might become \"empty\" if the transaction is abort just after the offset range creation. The same thing could happen if the \"untilOffset\" gets compacted (it's also a potential issue before this change)\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit test for the offset scan. No integration test for transaction since the current kafka version doesn't support transactions. Tested against a custom streaming use-case.","created_at":"2018-07-30T15:04:33Z","updated_at":"2020-01-10T00:07:07Z","closed_at":"2020-01-10T00:07:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"462a7c445400d7a3396cdfb1bc1cac43c246351d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406587334,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzM0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DSTREAMS","name":"DSTREAMS","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21917/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21917/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21917/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/69582f46cb8c7f7285c42b86d06bf475a43a3856","head":{"label":"QuentinAmbard:SPARK-24720","ref":"SPARK-24720","sha":"69582f46cb8c7f7285c42b86d06bf475a43a3856","user":{"login":"QuentinAmbard","id":96781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2Nzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/96781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuentinAmbard","html_url":"https://github.com/QuentinAmbard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuentinAmbard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuentinAmbard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuentinAmbard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuentinAmbard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuentinAmbard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuentinAmbard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuentinAmbard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuentinAmbard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/QuentinAmbard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"47d84e4d0e56e14f9402770dceaf0b4302c00e98","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

working.","created_at":"2018-07-30T14:53:22Z","updated_at":"2018-10-02T15:21:13Z","closed_at":"2018-10-02T15:21:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4b1884c4a45f1df47de797da83eaf7cfc318ba9e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21916/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21916/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21916/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b14cebc7d3872613f66a415b0b1943b6838ca9cf","head":{"label":"rezasafi:ptreememory","ref":"ptreememory","sha":"b14cebc7d3872613f66a415b0b1943b6838ca9cf","user":{"login":"rezasafi","id":20547172,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTQ3MTcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20547172?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi","html_url":"https://github.com/rezasafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":64172231,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NDE3MjIzMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"rezasafi/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rezasafi","id":20547172,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTQ3MTcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20547172?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi","html_url":"https://github.com/rezasafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rezasafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rezasafi/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWe don't support run a barrier stage with dynamic resource allocation enabled, it shall lead to some confusing behaviors (eg. with dynamic resource allocation enabled, it may happen that we acquire some executors (but not enough to launch all the tasks in a barrier stage) and later release them due to executor idle time expire, and then acquire again).\r\n\r\nWe perform the check on job submit and fail fast if running a barrier stage with dynamic resource allocation enabled.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded new test suite `BarrierStageOnSubmittedSuite` to cover all the fail fast cases that submitted a job containing one or more barrier stages.","created_at":"2018-07-30T14:40:27Z","updated_at":"2018-08-03T16:40:42Z","closed_at":"2018-08-03T16:40:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d246a596f32c77bd09e7a2d49f873207a072dee1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21915/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21915/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21915/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0796f760c60da9bb8b5cadeee2e751dd898cf8cf","head":{"label":"jiangxb1987:SPARK-24954","ref":"SPARK-24954","sha":"0796f760c60da9bb8b5cadeee2e751dd898cf8cf","user":{"login":"jiangxb1987","id":4784782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4784782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35214686,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTIxNDY4Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"jiangxb1987/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jiangxb1987","id":4784782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4784782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the PR, I propose to replace Scala parallel collections by new methods `parmap()`. The methods use futures to transform a sequential collection by applying a lambda function to each element in parallel. The result of `parmap` is another regular (sequential) collection. \r\n\r\nThe proposed `parmap` method aims to solve the problem of impossibility to interrupt parallel Scala collection. This possibility is needed for reliable task preemption.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nA test was added to `ThreadUtilsSuite`","created_at":"2018-07-29T18:27:47Z","updated_at":"2019-08-17T13:33:31Z","closed_at":"2018-08-07T09:18:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fc59eb778161748e76733afe720358bd969213bc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21913/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21913/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21913/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/610154c7a127628d6bb4d30c790d27db474fbf65","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:par-map","ref":"par-map","sha":"610154c7a127628d6bb4d30c790d27db474fbf65","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nMany Spark SQL users in my company have asked for a way to control the number of output files in Spark SQL.

SELECT /*+ REPARTITION(numPartitions) */ ...\r\n```\r\nMultiple such hints are allowed. Multiple nodes are inserted into the logical plan, and the optimizer will pick the leftmost hint.\r\n```\r\nINSERT INTO s SELECT /*+ REPARTITION(100), COALESCE(500), COALESCE(10) */ * FROM t\r\n\r\n== Logical Plan ==\r\n'InsertIntoTable 'UnresolvedRelation `s`, false, false\r\n+- 'UnresolvedHint REPARTITION, [100]\r\n   +- 'UnresolvedHint COALESCE, [500]\r\n      +- 'UnresolvedHint COALESCE, [10]\r\n         +- 'Project [*]\r\n            +- 'UnresolvedRelation `t`\r\n\r\n== Optimized Logical Plan ==\r\nInsertIntoHadoopFsRelationCommand ...\r\n+- Repartition 100, true\r\n   +- HiveTableRelation ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAll unit tests.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen we do an average, the result is computed dividing the sum of the values by their count. In the case the result is a DecimalType, the way we are casting/managing the precision and scale is not really optimized and it is not coherent with what we do normally.\r\n\r\nIn particular, a problem can happen when the `Divide` operand returns a result which contains a precision and scale different by the ones which are expected as output of the `Divide` operand. In the case reported in the JIRA, for instance, the result of the `Divide` operand is a `Decimal(38, 36)`, while the output data type for `Divide` is 38, 22. This is not an issue when the `Divide` is followed by a `CheckOverflow` or a `Cast` to the right data type, as these operations return a decimal with the defined precision and scale. Despite in the `Average` operator we do have a `Cast`, this may be bypassed if the result of `Divide` is the same type which it is casted to, hence the issue reported in the JIRA may arise.\r\n\r\nThe PR proposes to use the normal rules/handling of the arithmetic operators with Decimal data type, so we both reuse the existing code (having a single logic for operations between decimals) and we fix this problem as the result is always guarded by `CheckOverflow`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nadded UT\r\n","created_at":"2018-07-29T11:08:46Z","updated_at":"2018-08-01T17:20:07Z","closed_at":"2018-07-30T12:58:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7c0a87e68f25f342de1719f50d610d9ec9741e8a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21910/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21910/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21910/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1938be02edce7c34c7d1d3686a5b0c15a158f0e4","head":{"label":"mgaido91:SPARK-24957","ref":"SPARK-24957","sha":"1938be02edce7c34c7d1d3686a5b0c15a158f0e4","user":{"login":"mgaido91","id":8821783,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MjE3ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8821783?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91","html_url":"https://github.com/mgaido91","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":94518128,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NDUxODEyOA==","name":"spark","full_name":"mgaido91/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mgaido91","id":8821783,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MjE3ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8821783?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91","html_url":"https://github.com/mgaido91","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mgaido91/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the PR, I propose to support `LZMA2` (`XZ`) and `BZIP2` compressions by `AVRO` datasource  in write since the codecs may have better characteristics like compression ratio and speed comparing to already supported `snappy` and `deflate` codecs.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nIt was tested manually and by an existing test which was extended to check the `xz` and `bzip2` compressions.","created_at":"2018-07-27T21:31:26Z","updated_at":"2019-08-17T13:33:36Z","closed_at":"2018-07-31T01:16:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d959bc63f34bb6eec99db751a6a1a1e472449174","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21902/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21902/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21902/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/97c67ef2f816406a18bf79fb38a5a9ad8cd8a621","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:avro-xz-bzip2","ref":"avro-xz-bzip2","sha":"97c67ef2f816406a18bf79fb38a5a9ad8cd8a621","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR shows the stack trace of the original OutOfMemoryError that occurs while building or broadcasting a HashedRelation, rather than the stack trace of the newly created OutOfMemoryError that's created during error handling.\r\n\r\nCurrently, when an OOM occurs while broadcasting a table, the stack trace points to a line in the error handling:\r\n<pre>\r\njava.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Not enough memory to build and broadcast the table to all worker nodes. As a workaround, you can either disable broadcast by setting spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold to -1 or increase the spark driver memory by setting spark.driver.memory to a higher value\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.exchange.BroadcastExchangeExec$$anonfun$relationFuture$1$$anonfun$apply$1.apply(BroadcastExchangeExec.scala:122)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.exchange.BroadcastExchangeExec$$anonfun$relationFuture$1$$anonfun$apply$1.apply(BroadcastExchangeExec.scala:76)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.SQLExecution$$anonfun$withExecutionId$1.apply(SQLExecution.scala:101)\r\n</pre>\r\nWith this PR, it shows the original stack trace.\r\n<pre>\r\njava.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Not enough memory to build and broadcast the table to all worker nodes. As a workaround, you can either disable broadcast by setting spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold to -1 or increase the spark driver memory by setting spark.driver.memory to a higher value.\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.joins.LongToUnsafeRowMap.grow(HashedRelation.scala:628)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.joins.LongToUnsafeRowMap.append(HashedRelation.scala:570)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.joins.LongHashedRelation$.apply(HashedRelation.scala:865)\r\n</pre>\r\nIn addition, when the error occurs during broadcast, rather then construction of the relation, the message includes the estimated size of the relation:\r\n<pre>\r\njava.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Not enough memory to build and broadcast the table to all worker nodes. As a workaround, you can either disable broadcast by setting spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold to -1 or increase spark.driver.memory by at least the estimated size of the relation (96468992 bytes).\r\n  at java.nio.HeapByteBuffer.<init>(HeapByteBuffer.java:57)\r\n  at java.nio.ByteBuffer.allocate(ByteBuffer.java:335)\r\n  at

org.apache.spark.broadcast.TorrentBroadcast$$anonfun$3.apply(TorrentBroadcast.scala:286)\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nWhile sometimes the line on which is the exception is thrown is just a victim, sometimes it is a participant in the problem, as was the case in the above exception.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested case where broadcast join caused an OOM, and a case where it did not.\r\n","created_at":"2018-07-27T19:06:48Z","updated_at":"2022-05-01T01:15:50Z","closed_at":"2019-09-30T18:35:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3341dd23cf0dd28c5874906d69d5bbcfe32abaf4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21899/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21899/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21899/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e927cd3d88a787cbd39fd99cc5afa942d7e955f0","head":{"label":"bersprockets:SPARK-24912","ref":"SPARK-24912","sha":"e927cd3d88a787cbd39fd99cc5afa942d7e955f0","user":{"login":"bersprockets","id":21131848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTMxODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21131848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets","html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":115567071,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTU1NjcwNzE=","name":"spark","full_name":"bersprockets/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bersprockets","id":21131848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTMxODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21131848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets","html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nImplement BarrierTaskContext.barrier(), to support global sync between all the tasks in a barrier stage.\r\nThe function set a global barrier and waits until all tasks in this stage hit this barrier. Similar to MPI_Barrier function in MPI, the barrier() function call blocks until all tasks in the same stage have reached this routine. The global sync shall finish immediately once all tasks in the same barrier stage reaches the same barrier.\r\n\r\nThis PR implements BarrierTaskContext.barrier() based on netty-based RPC client, introduces new `BarrierCoordinator` and new `BarrierCoordinatorMessage`, and new config to handle timeout issue.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd `BarrierTaskContextSuite` to test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn `SparkHadoopUtil. checkAccessPermission`,  we consider only basic permissions in order to check wether a user can access a file or not. This is not a complete check, as it ignores ACLs and other policies a file system may apply in its internal. So this can result in returning wrongly that a user cannot access a file (despite he actually can).\r\n\r\nThe PR proposes to delegate to the filesystem the check whether a file is accessible or not, in order to return the right result. A caching layer is added for performance reasons.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nmodified

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR propose to remove `-Phive-thriftserver` profile which seems not affecting the SparkR tests in AppVeyor.\r\n\r\nOriginally wanted to

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the PR, I propose to upgrade uniVocity parser from **2.6.3** to **2.7.2**. The recent version includes a fix for the SPARK-24645 issue. Here is the bug report for uniVocity https://github.com/uniVocity/univocity-parsers/issues/250.\r\n\r\nI removed the changes in `UnivocityParser` introduced by the commit: https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/bd32b509a1728366494cba13f8f6612b7bd46ec0 but leaved the test from the commit.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI tested by `CSVSuite` and by running `CSVBenchmarks`. The difference between 2.6.3 and 2.7.2 is 0.2% - 8% except a benchmark for `count()`. Performance degradation in the last case is **x3.8**.\r\n\r\nBefore changes:\r\n```\r\nParsing quoted values:                   Best/Avg Time(ms)    Rate(M/s)   Per Row(ns)

\"ExecutorLossReason\". So it call tell driver whether is the executor \"exitCausedByApp\" which should be false. So when dirver(TaskSetManager) can \"handleFailedTask\" correctly to avoid task failed time up to the \"maxTaskFailures\" and finally cause job failed.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch

Motivation\r\n\r\nIn SPARK-19140 we supported *update* output mode for non-aggregation streaming queries by letting it behaves exactly same as *append* mode.

output mode in streaming join query, the JOIN operator will works exactly same as *append* mode. \r\n\r\nFor example, this will allow user to run an aggregation-after-join query in *update* mode in

to Jira: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-4502)\r\n\r\n**This is a restart of apache/spark#21320. Most of the discussion has taken place over there. I've only taken it as a based to make changes based on the code review to help move things along.**\r\n\r\nDue to the urgency of the upcoming 2.4 code freeze, I'm going to open this PR to collect any feedback. This can be closed if you prefer to continue to the work in the original PR.\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nOne of the hallmarks of a column-oriented data storage format is the ability to read data from a subset of columns, efficiently skipping reads from other columns. Spark has long had support for pruning unneeded top-level schema fields from the scan of a parquet file. For example, consider a table, contacts, backed by parquet with the following Spark SQL schema:\r\n\r\n```\r\nroot\r\n |-- name: struct\r\n |    |-- first: string\r\n |    |-- last: string\r\n |-- address: string\r\n```\r\nParquet stores this table's data in three physical columns: name.first, name.last and address. To answer the query\r\n\r\n`select address from contacts`\r\nSpark will read only from the address column of parquet data. However, to answer the query\r\n\r\n`select name.first from contacts`\r\nSpark will read name.first and name.last from parquet.\r\n\r\nThis PR modifies Spark SQL to support a finer-grain of schema pruning. With this patch, Spark reads only the name.first column to answer the previous query.\r\n\r\n### Implementation\r\nThere are two main components of this patch. First, there is a ParquetSchemaPruning optimizer rule for gathering the required schema fields of a PhysicalOperation over a parquet file, constructing a new schema based on those required fields and rewriting the plan in terms of that pruned schema. The pruned schema fields are pushed down to the parquet requested read schema. ParquetSchemaPruning uses a new ProjectionOverSchema extractor for rewriting a catalyst expression in terms of a pruned schema.\r\n\r\nSecond, the ParquetRowConverter has been patched to ensure the ordinals of the parquet columns read are correct for the pruned schema. ParquetReadSupport has been patched to address a compatibility mismatch between Spark's built in vectorized reader and the parquet-mr library's reader.\r\n\r\n### Limitation\r\nAmong the complex Spark SQL data types, this patch supports parquet column pruning of nested sequences of struct fields only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nCare has been taken to ensure correctness and prevent regressions. A more advanced version of this patch incorporating optimizations for rewriting queries involving aggregations and joins has been running on a production Spark cluster at VideoAmp for several years. In that time, one bug was found and fixed early on, and we added a regression test for that bug.\r\n\r\nWe forward-ported this patch to Spark master in June 2016 and have been running this patch against Spark 2.x branches on ad-hoc clusters since then.\r\n\r\n### Known Issues\r\nHighlighted in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis adds support for DELETE FROM in SQL using the new DeleteFrom logical plan and v2 DeleteSupport mix-in.\r\n\r\nTo identify the v2 table to delete data from, this uses the TableCatalog API introduced in #21306.\r\n\r\nTableIdentifier has been updated with a new superclass, CatalogTableIdentifier. Code paths that don't support identifiers with a catalog continue to use TableIdentifier, allowing a smooth transition even though some code assumes there is no support for multiple catalogs.\r\n\r\nUnresovledRelation now supports CatalogTableIdentifier, but resolution will only happen when the catalog is not defined or through a new rule with support for v2 TableCatalog. Existing uses of UnresolvedRelation access the catalog using tableIdentifier, which asserts that the catalog is not defined before returning to ensure catalog identifiers don't leak to code without catalog support.\r\n\r\nWIP: This is based on #21306, #21305, and #21877 and includes the changes from those PRs.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nWIP, will add

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nNetty could just ignore user-provided configurations. In particular, spark.driver.cores would be ignored when considering the number of cores available to netty (which would usually just default to Runtime.availableProcessors() ). In transport configurations, the number of threads are based directly on how many cores the system believes it has available, and in yarn cluster mode this would generally overshoot the user-preferred

Seq(Array(\"a\", \"b\"), Array(\"c\", \"d\")).toDF(\"arrayCol\")\r\ndf.cache().filter(\"arrayCol > array('a', 'b')\").show()\r\n```\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nval df = sql(\"select cast('a' as binary) as a\")\r\ndf.cache().filter(\"a == cast('a' as binary)\").show()\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Before:**\r\n\r\n```\r\n+--------+\r\n|arrayCol|\r\n+--------+\r\n+--------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n+---+\r\n|  a|\r\n+---+\r\n+---+\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n**After:**\r\n\r\n```\r\n+--------+\r\n|arrayCol|\r\n+--------+\r\n|  [c, d]|\r\n+--------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n+----+\r\n|   a|\r\n+----+\r\n|[61]|\r\n+----+\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests were added and manually tested.","created_at":"2018-07-26T13:15:25Z","updated_at":"2018-10-16T12:45:56Z","closed_at":"2018-07-30T05:23:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"247c8b428f8d4225c1f62e302b16ebf203d51316","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21882/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21882/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21882/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/deb20eff74252a617790eb595592dd5f80eceb71","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:stats-filter","ref":"stats-filter","sha":"deb20eff74252a617790eb595592dd5f80eceb71","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n* Remove extends from `ReadSupport` and `WriteSupport` classes for use with `Table`\r\n* Add CTAS and RTAS logical plans\r\n* Refactor physical write plans so AppendData, CTAS, and RTAS use the same base class\r\n* Add support for `TableCatalog` to `DataFrameReader` and `DataFrameWriter`\r\n* Add `TableV2Relation` for tables that are loaded by `TableCatalog` and have no `DataSource` instance\r\n* Move implicit helpers into `DataSourceV2Implicits` to avoid future churn\r\n\r\nNote that this doesn't handle `partitionBy` in `DataFrameWriter`.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is an extension to the original PR, in which rule exclusion did not work for classes derived from Optimizer, e.g., SparkOptimizer.\r\nTo solve this issue, Optimizer and its derived classes will define/override `defaultBatches` and `nonExcludableRules` in order to define its default rule set as well as rules that cannot be excluded by the SQL config. In the meantime, Optimizer's `batches` method is dedicated to the rule exclusion logic and is defined \"final\".\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded

refer to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-24906 for more detail and test\r\n\r\nFor columnar file, such as, when spark sql read the table, each split will be 128 MB by default since spark.sql.files.maxPartitionBytes is default to 128MB. Even when user set it to a large value, such as 512MB, the task may read only few MB or even hundreds of KB. Because the table (Parquet) may consists of dozens of columns while the SQL only need few columns. And spark will prune the unnecessary columns.\r\n\r\nIn this case, spark DataSourceScanExec can enlarge maxPartitionBytes adaptively. \r\n\r\nFor example, there is 40 columns , 20 are integer while another 20 are long. When use query on an integer type column and an long type column, the maxPartitionBytes should be 20 times larger. (20*4+20*8) /  (4+8) = 20. \r\n\r\n With this optimization, the number of task will be smaller and the job will run faster.

new ubuntu-testing machine.\r\n\r\nwhile running my initial builds, lintr was crashing on some extraneous spaces in test_basic.R (see:  https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/spark-master-test-sbt-hadoop-2.6-ubuntu-test/862/console)\r\n\r\nafter removing those spaces, the ubuntu build happily passed the lintr tests.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\ni then tested this against a modified spark-master-test-sbt-hadoop-2.6 build (see https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/view/RISELab%20Infra/job/testing-spark-master-test-with-updated-R-crap/4/), which scp'ed a copy of test_basic.R in to the repo after the git clone.  everything

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nImplements EXCEPT ALL clause through query rewrites using existing operators in Spark. In this PR, an internal UDTF (replicate_rows) is added to aid in preserving duplicate rows. Please refer to [Link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1nyW0T0b_ajUduQoPgZLAsyHK8s3_dko3ulQuxaLpUXE) for the design.\r\n\r\n**Note** This proposed UDTF is kept as a internal function that is purely used to aid with this particular rewrite to give us flexibility to change to a more generalized UDTF in future.\r\n\r\nInput Query\r\n``` SQL\r\nSELECT c1 FROM ut1 EXCEPT ALL SELECT c1 FROM

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThanks to @henryr for the original idea at https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/21049\r\n\r\nDescription from the original PR :\r\nSubqueries (at least in SQL) have 'bag of tuples' semantics. Ordering\r\nthem is therefore redundant (unless combined with a limit). \r\n\r\nThis patch removes the top sort operators from the subquery plans.\r\n\r\nThis closes https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/21049.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded test cases in SubquerySuite to cover in, exists and scalar subqueries.\r\n\r\nPlease review http://spark.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull request.\r\n","created_at":"2018-07-23T21:41:59Z","updated_at":"2018-07-25T03:58:28Z","closed_at":"2018-07-25T03:50:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ee53148b44c5afa2836f20d566583a32c6a93362","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21853/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21853/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21853/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a86cb9f8764ac4962905ee1b8772fec5692d4342","head":{"label":"dilipbiswal:SPARK-23957","ref":"SPARK-23957","sha":"a86cb9f8764ac4962905ee1b8772fec5692d4342","user":{"login":"dilipbiswal","id":14225158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjI1MTU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14225158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal","html_url":"https://github.com/dilipbiswal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42921897,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjkyMTg5Nw==","name":"spark","full_name":"dilipbiswal/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dilipbiswal","id":14225158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjI1MTU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14225158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal","html_url":"https://github.com/dilipbiswal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dilipbiswal/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe HandleNullInputsForUDF would always add a new `If` node every time it is applied. That would cause a difference between the same plan being analyzed once and being analyzed twice (or more), thus raising issues like plan not matched in the cache manager. The solution is to mark the arguments as null-checked, which is to add a \"KnownNotNull\" node above those arguments, when adding the UDF under an `If` node, because clearly the UDF will not be called when any of those arguments is null.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdd new tests under sql/UDFSuite and AnalysisSuite.\r\n","created_at":"2018-07-23T19:03:57Z","updated_at":"2018-07-25T02:40:38Z","closed_at":"2018-07-25T02:39:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7e2c529136a88bf6704e0925286e2a13cbed4865","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21851/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21851/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21851/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b499b9727a4cb9cc42149d05a4d54dba2de8bd9e","head":{"label":"maryannxue:spark-24891","ref":"spark-24891","sha":"b499b9727a4cb9cc42149d05a4d54dba2de8bd9e","user":{"login":"maryannxue","id":4171904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNzE5MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4171904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue","html_url":"https://github.com/maryannxue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":104110775,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDQxMTA3NzU=","name":"spark","full_name":"maryannxue/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"maryannxue","id":4171904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNzE5MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4171904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue","html_url":"https://github.com/maryannxue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/maryannxue/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAllows `avroSchema` option to be specified on write, allowing a user to specify a schema in cases where this is required.  A trivial use case is reading in an avro dataset, making some small adjustment to a column or columns and writing out using the same schema.  Implicit schema creation from SQL Struct results in a schema that while for the most part, is functionally similar, is not necessarily compatible.\r\n\r\nAllows `fixed` Field type to be utilized for records of specified `avroSchema`\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests in AvroSuite are extended to test this with enum and fixed types.\r\n\r\nPlease review http://spark.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull request.\r\n","created_at":"2018-07-23T16:13:51Z","updated_at":"2018-08-10T03:39:53Z","closed_at":"2018-08-10T03:39:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"855cd54d3f07c8efa8157d97cbbf3e58abe7e6eb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21847/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21847/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21847/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/df486f23d763450800bc7d8c4f03224d6fad1df0","head":{"label":"lindblombr:specify_schema_on_write","ref":"specify_schema_on_write","sha":"df486f23d763450800bc7d8c4f03224d6fad1df0","user":{"login":"lindblombr","id":26661755,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NjYxNzU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26661755?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindblombr","html_url":"https://github.com/lindblombr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindblombr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindblombr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindblombr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindblombr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindblombr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindblombr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindblombr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindblombr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindblombr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":95156963,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NTE1Njk2Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"lindblombr/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lindblombr","id":26661755,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NjYxNzU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26661755?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindblombr","html_url":"https://github.com/lindblombr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindblombr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindblombr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindblombr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindblombr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindblombr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindblombr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindblombr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindblombr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindblombr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lindblombr/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the PR, I added new option for Avro datasource - `compression`. The option allows to specify compression codec for saved Avro files. This option is similar to `compression` option in another datasources like `JSON` and `CSV`. \r\n\r\nAlso I added the SQL configs `spark.sql.avro.compression.codec` and `spark.sql.avro.deflate.level`. I put the configs into `SQLConf`. If the `compression` option is not specified by an user, the first SQL config is taken into account.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI added new test which read meta info from written avro files and checks `avro.codec` property.","created_at":"2018-07-22T09:01:50Z","updated_at":"2019-08-17T13:35:07Z","closed_at":"2018-07-27T16:15:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"eb892f1f865400d9b92b2181a9a42e12adb8dcaf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21837/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21837/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21837/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5f83902e2876745f8be245681e7cb41d69421778","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:avro-compression","ref":"avro-compression","sha":"5f83902e2876745f8be245681e7cb41d69421778","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWe get a NPE when we have a filter on a partition column of the form `col in (x, null)`. This is due to the filter converter in HiveShim not handling `null`s correctly. This patch fixes this bug while still pushing down as much of the partition pruning predicates as possible, by filtering out `null`s from any `in` predicate. Since Hive only supports very simple partition pruning filters, this change should preserve correctness.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests, manual tests\r\n","created_at":"2018-07-20T20:06:03Z","updated_at":"2018-07-21T03:03:14Z","closed_at":"2018-07-21T03:03:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"45ee943da4dc35d92be532c3e14b59c1a878ee1c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21832/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21832/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21832/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ce86fbeda06eb2448ecd2c425982aacca3d66b45","head":{"label":"PenguinToast:partition-pruning-npe","ref":"partition-pruning-npe","sha":"ce86fbeda06eb2448ecd2c425982aacca3d66b45","user":{"login":"PenguinToast","id":3289041,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyODkwNDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3289041?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PenguinToast","html_url":"https://github.com/PenguinToast","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PenguinToast/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PenguinToast/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PenguinToast/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PenguinToast/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PenguinToast/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PenguinToast/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PenguinToast/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PenguinToast/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PenguinToast/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":134910614,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzQ5MTA2MTQ=","name":"spark","full_name":"PenguinToast/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"PenguinToast","id":3289041,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyODkwNDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3289041?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PenguinToast","html_url":"https://github.com/PenguinToast","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PenguinToast/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PenguinToast/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PenguinToast/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PenguinToast/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PenguinToast/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PenguinToast/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PenguinToast/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PenguinToast/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PenguinToast/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/PenguinToast/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nPreviously in the refactoring of Avro Serializer and Deserializer, a new class SerializableSchema is created for serializing the Avro

After that, parse the JSON format schema on executor. This makes the code much simpler.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit
