Any System properties that are used by Geode but not listed in the file should be added\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses the first three points.

All three of these classes now delegate to a non-static \"instance\" class which is fully unit-testable without powermock. \r\n\r\nWe have many system tests which provide test coverage of this delegation. For that reason, I deleted ReferenceCountHelperJUnitTest and did not write new tests for the delegation in OffHeapRegionEntryHelper and ReferenceCounter. Trying to test static-to-non-static delegation is just as problematic as trying to test a static/singleton, so this is the best compromise with no actual loss of test coverage if you count the

will require a subsequent change in develop to update KnownVersion 1.15]\r\n\r\nA client's version is used for deserializing data received from the client and for\r\nserializing data sent to the client. It is also used to locate the map of Commands\r\nused to process client requests. Every time we cut a new release we bump this version\r\nin KnownVersions and create a new map of Commands, even though client/server\r\ncommunications protocols rarely change.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes KnownVersions to hold a client/server protocol version that is\r\nused to identify clients for command-table selection and serialization rather than\r\nthe client's CURRENT_VERSION.\r\n\r\nAltered KnownVersions to just mark each version that has client/server\r\nprotocol changes rather than store the last one having changes in the\r\nmore recent instances.

PR allows to bind membership endpoints to all interfaces via the `--bind-address` attribute. When a wildcard address is introduced with that parameter, the membership UDP traffic will be bound to localhost due to JGroups does not allow to bind to wildcard addresses.\r\n\r\nIf a different address for UDP traffic needs to be used, it can be specified with the new parameter called `membership-bind-addresss`.\r\n\r\nI have not squashed the commits of the PR because I think it can be useful for reviewers.

this should be the default behavior. I currently have the file watching key and trust managers enabled when the user does not set the \"use default SSL context\" flag (which means they are enabled under Geode's default settings). However, I could see how changing the default behavior might be surprising to some users. I could instead add a flag which enables the \"automatic reload\" behavior and make it disabled by default if the reviewers think that would be

changes have been made to solve issues\r\nfound when running queries targeting a Map field\r\nwith and without indexes in the Map field.\r\n\r\n- For queries without an index in the Map field\r\nthe behavior has been changed so that\r\nfor queries like \"positions['SUN'] = null\" instead\r\nof returning those entries fulfiling\r\nthat condition and also those entries\r\nwhere the Map does not contain the 'SUN' key\r\nor the Map is null, it now returns\r\nonly entries where the Map contains the\r\n'SUN' key and the value is equal to null.\r\n\r\n- As a consequence of the above, queries\r\nwithout an index in the Map field like\r\n\"positions['SUN'] != null\" will now return\r\nany entry that does not contain\r\nthe positions field Map with the 'SUN' key\r\nand with value equal to null.\r\n\r\n- For queries with an index in the Map field,\r\neither specifying several keys or '*'\r\nthe behavior has been modified (fixed) so that\r\n\"!=\" conditions targeting the indexed\r\nMap fields return the same entries returned\r\nwhen the index is not present. Prior to this\r\nchange, only entries containing the Map\r\nwere returned but if the Map was not\r\npresent in the entry then that entry was\r\nnot returned.\r\n\r\n- Indexes for a field Map\r\nspecifying just one key, e.g.\r\npositions['SUN'] have been changed\r\ninternally from Range indexes\r\nto Map indexes in order to align\r\nthe behavior with Map indexes\r\n(those that specified more than\r\none key or '*' for a Map field)\r\nso that the space taken by this type\r\nof index is equivalent to the\r\none taken by one specifying\r\nmore than one key for the Map.\r\nThis has also solved some wrong\r\nbehavior of these indexes that\r\nsometimes did not return the expected\r\nnumber of entries.\r\nThe drawback of this change is that\r\n\"!=\" queries for the map field\r\nwill not make use of the index.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?
