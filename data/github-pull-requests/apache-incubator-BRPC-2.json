What problem does this PR solve?\r\n\r\nIssue Number:\r\n#2635\r\nProblem Summary:\r\n当brpc server 下处理的应用执行时间较短(bthread生命周期短)，且使用了bthread_local变量时，由于keytable 由bthread_keytable_pool_t中的一个全局链表维护，borrow_keytable、return_keytable时内部加互斥锁，导致锁成为瓶颈。\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/brpc/assets/52315061/7a2122c9-f373-42af-badb-da4d9f834dac)\r\n\r\n基于此，重新设计了bthread_keytable_pool_t：\r\n新的bthread_keytable_pool_t结构体中，使用butil::ThreadLocal<bthread::KeyTableList>* list 保存TLS的KeyTable list。同时保留原有的free_keytables，不改变reserved_thread_local_data的语义，调用bthread_keytable_pool_reserve会在全局链表中预分配keytable.原有的互斥锁改为读写锁。\r\n* borrow_keytable时优先从本地TLS链表中查找是否有可用的KeyTable，如果没有，且free_keytables不为NULL，再去从全局链表中加写锁获取keytable；如果都没有可用table，则返回NULL。\r\n* return_keytable时只会将keytable插入TLS的KeyTable list中，由于是TLS变量，只有当bthread_keytable_pool_destroy才会产生竞争，所以只需要加写锁。\r\n* bthread_keytable_pool_destroy时加写锁，首先delete butil::ThreadLocal<bthread::KeyTableList>* list，pool->destroyed = 1.然后如果free_keytables不为NULL，再释放free_keytables的空间。\r\n* borrow_keytable、return_keytable内部只加读锁，bthread_keytable_pool_destroy、bthread_keytable_pool_reserve内部加写锁。sever正常运行时，一般只会调用borrow_keytable、return_keytable接口，不会产生锁的竞争。\r\n### What is changed and the side

What problem does this PR solve?\r\n\r\nIssue Number:\r\n\r\nProblem Summary:\r\n\r\n从 cmdline 中获取程序名称时不包含程序的完整路径。因为程序的启动路径可能已经包含在了 $PATH 中，所以 cmdline 中只有程序的名称而没有路径信息，导致在使用 `ProgramCHECKSUM` 以及使用 `heap profile` 解析符号时找不到程序的具体位置而导致失败。\r\n\r\n#### 复现：\r\n```\r\nexport PATH=$PATH:/path/to/echo_server\r\n```\r\n启动server\r\n```\r\necho_server\r\n```\r\n获取程序的校验码会报错：\r\n```\r\nE20240515

What problem does this PR solve?\r\n\r\nIssue Number:\r\n\r\nProblem Summary:\r\n\r\n目前FlatMap需要二段式构造：构造函数+init函数。这种构造方式很容易用错，甚至出core，所以使用上必须小心翼翼，体验不好。\r\n\r\n### What is changed and the side effects?\r\n\r\nChanged:\r\n\r\nFlatMap构造函数结束即完成初始化。使用sso、IOBuf::SmallView的策略，初始化_buckets和_thumbnail使用内联的内存块，没有init函数中Alloc失败的顾虑。后续可以不用调init进行初始化，可以只在需要桶数比较大或者修改load factor才调init。即使init失败了，FlatMap还是可以正常使用的。\r\n\r\nSide effects:\r\n- Performance effects(性能影响):\r\n\r\n- Breaking backward compatibility(向后兼容性): \r\n\r\n---\r\n### Check List:\r\n- Please make sure your changes are compilable(请确保你的更改可以通过编译).\r\n- When providing us with a new feature, it is best to add related tests(如果你向我们增加一个新的功能, 请添加相关测试).\r\n- Please follow [Contributor Covenant Code of

What problem does this PR solve?\r\n\r\nIssue Number: resolve #2575 \r\n\r\nProblem Summary:\r\n\r\n目前bRPC处理cookie和set-cookie这两个header的逻辑有问题：\r\n1. [RFC 9114](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9114#section-4.2.1)规定： 多个cookie不能用`,`分隔，应该要用`; `；\r\n> If a decompressed field section contains multiple cookie field lines, these MUST be concatenated into a single byte string using the two-byte delimiter of \"; \" (ASCII 0x3b, 0x20) before being passed into a context other than HTTP/2 or HTTP/3, such as an HTTP/1.1 connection, or a generic HTTP server application.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. [RFC 6265](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6265#section-3) 规定：多个set-cookie不能合并到一个header。\r\n> Origin servers SHOULD NOT fold multiple Set-Cookie header fields into\r\n   a single header field.  The usual mechanism for folding HTTP headers\r\n   fields (i.e., as defined in [[RFC2616](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616)]) might change the semantics of\r\n   the Set-Cookie header field because the %x2C (\",\") character is used\r\n   by Set-Cookie in a way that conflicts with such folding.\r\n\r\n### What is changed and the side effects?\r\n\r\nChanged:\r\n\r\n1. 多个cookie要用`; `分隔；\r\n2. 内部使用std::unordered_multimap代替butil::CaseIgnoredFlatMap，用来支持同时保存多个set-cookie的特性。为了尽量兼容原来的逻辑：\r\n2.1 GetHeader、SetHeader只对第一个set-cookie生效。当只有一个set-cookie的时候，这两个api的表现不变。\r\n2.2 AppendHeader会直接创建新的set-cookie。\r\n2.3 HeaderBegin和HeaderEnd这两个api表现不变，还是可以遍历到所有header。\r\n\r\nSide effects:\r\n- Performance effects(性能影响):\r\n\r\n- Breaking backward compatibility(向后兼容性): \r\n\r\n---\r\n### Check List:\r\n- Please make sure your changes are compilable(请确保你的更改可以通过编译).\r\n- When providing us with a new feature, it is best to add related tests(如果你向我们增加一个新的功能, 请添加相关测试).\r\n- Please follow [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](../../master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).(请遵循贡献者准则).\r\n","created_at":"2024-03-19T16:32:57Z","updated_at":"2024-06-11T01:59:45Z","closed_at":"2024-06-03T08:47:44Z","merged_at":"2024-06-03T08:47:44Z","merge_commit_sha":"4f85335dab82eb142383f52a81db3cc7376bb1b4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/brpc/pulls/2577/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/brpc/pulls/2577/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/brpc/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/brpc/issues/2577/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/brpc/statuses/0a95f0c92b7102926cf9dd890aa2a22381a8efbe","head":{"label":"chenBright:cookie","ref":"cookie","sha":"0a95f0c92b7102926cf9dd890aa2a22381a8efbe","user":{"login":"chenBright","id":12249635,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjQ5NjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12249635?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenBright","html_url":"https://github.com/chenBright","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenBright/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenBright/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenBright/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenBright/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenBright/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenBright/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenBright/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenBright/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenBright/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":505688055,"node_id":"R_kgDOHiQv9w","name":"brpc","full_name":"chenBright/brpc","private":false,"owner":{"login":"chenBright","id":12249635,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjQ5NjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12249635?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenBright","html_url":"https://github.com/chenBright","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenBright/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenBright/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenBright/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenBright/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenBright/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenBright/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenBright/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenBright/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenBright/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/chenBright/brpc","description":"Industrial-grade

将SocketId的功能抽象到VersionedRefWithId。只要实现OnCreated、OnFailed、BeforeRecycle、AfterRevived等接口即可。\r\n2. EventDispatcher支持多种IO类型。在EventDispatcher和具体IO对象之间加入一层EventData对象（包含IO对象id、读事件回调函数、写事件回调函数）。在1的基础上，实现EventDataId，代替EventDispatcher中的SocketId。IO对象创建自己的EventData并持有EventDataId，将其注册到EventDispatcher。当有事件触发时，EventDispatcher通过EventDataId找到EventData，执行对应的回调函数。\r\n\r\nSide

What problem does this PR solve?\r\n\r\nIssue Number:\r\n\r\nProblem Summary:\r\n\r\nCachedReader::get_value中fn没有在锁内执行，第一次执行get_value的时候，可能会读到_cache的初始值。由于_cache没有显式初始化，而且实际的类型（如ProcMemory、ProcStat）没有实现默认构造函数，所以成员变量的值是随机值。相对于随机值，值为0，让人更好理解一些。\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/brpc/blob/24fc31eaa56d8b522975ca41ed012faf6cf77438/src/bvar/default_variables.cpp#L147-L163\r\n\r\n###

支持在数据写入socket写入成功后调用id_wait回调函数：对于一些请求和响应不是一一对应的场景，例如WebSocket、TCP Stream客户端、Streaming rpc等，只需要关注数据是否写入成功。数据写入socket写入成功后调用id_wait回调函数，可以统计成功率、耗时等。#2545 \r\n\r\nSide effects:\r\n- Performance

What problem does this PR solve?\r\n\r\nIssue Number:\r\n\r\nProblem Summary:\r\n\r\nWe have met a problem in Apache Doris where a stream rpc client cannot receive any message (including `on_closed`) from stream server.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/doris/pull/30476\r\n\r\nIn certain cases, if the server-side stream is actively closing the stream.\r\nThe close frame is not sent to client-side

What problem does this PR solve?\r\n\r\nIssue Number:\r\n\r\nProblem Summary:\r\n\r\n1. [RFC 7230 3.3.3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7230#section-3.3.3)规范：Content-Length和Transfer-Encoding: chunked不能一起使用，或者忽略Content-Length。目前brpc使用的http-parser版本比较旧，允许Content-Length和Transfer-Encoding: chunked一起使用，存在请求走私（Request Smuggling）和响应拆分（response splitting）的风险。\r\n\r\n2. [RFC 7233 3.3.2](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7230#section-3.3.2)规范：有Transfer-Encoding的时候，发送者不能发送Content-Length。\r\n\r\n### What is changed and the side effects?\r\n\r\nChanged:\r\n\r\n1. 引入最新[http-parser](https://github.com/nodejs/http-parser/blob/main/http_parser.c#L1808)中Content-Length和Transfer-Encoding相关的代码。解析http包时，默认拒绝同时存在Content-Length和Transfer-Encoding的http包。如果打开开关且Transfer-Encoding的最后一个编码是chunked时，则移除Content-Length，接受该http包。\r\n2. 组http包时，有Transfer-Encoding，则移除且不添加Content-Length。\r\n\r\nSide effects:\r\n- Performance effects(性能影响):\r\n\r\n- Breaking backward compatibility(向后兼容性): \r\n\r\n---\r\n### Check List:\r\n- Please make sure your changes are compilable(请确保你的更改可以通过编译).\r\n- When providing us with a new feature, it is best to add related tests(如果你向我们增加一个新的功能, 请添加相关测试).\r\n- Please follow [Contributor Covenant Code of

What problem does this PR solve?\r\n\r\nIssue Number:\r\n\r\nProblem Summary:\r\n\r\n对于`::Singleton<T>`，在T构造的时候，并发调用`get`函数，只有一个线程会调用T的构造函数，其他线程会在`WaitForInstance`函数中等待（自旋+`sched_yield`）T完成构造。如果T构造函数中有挂起bthrea的操作，并发大的情况下，有可能会导致“死锁”问题：所有worker线程都在`WaitForInstance`函数中等待T完成构造，而此时已经没有worker可以调度执行T构造函数的bthread了，即T已经无法完成构造。\r\n\r\nPR中的UT可以复现该问题。\r\n\r\n### What is changed and the side effects?\r\n\r\nChanged:\r\n\r\n在链接了bthread时，使用`bthread_usleep`，这样在bthread上使用的`:Singleton<T>`就不会阻塞所有worker线程了。\r\n\r\nSide effects:\r\n- Performance

What problem does this PR solve?\r\n\r\nIssue Number:\r\n\r\nProblem Summary:\r\n当 brpc 使用 libc++ 编译时，使用当前 gdb bthread 调试脚本会出现找不到符号错误（ `_M_i`, `._M_b._M_p` 等变量），这些变量应该是来自 [libstdc++](https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/master/libstdc%2B%2B-v3/include/std/atomic)  实现 `std::atomic` 的中的，而当使用 [libc++](https://github.com/llvm-mirror/libcxx/blob/master/include/atomic) 时没有这些变量，所以会出现此类错误。\r\n\r\n```python\r\n(gdb) bthread_begin \r\nPython Exception <class 'gdb.error'>: There is no member or method named _M_i.\r\nError occurred in Python: There is no member or method named _M_i.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What is changed and the side effects?\r\n\r\nChanged:\r\n\r\n使用类型强转实现从 `atomic<T> ` -> `T` 的转化，避免使用特定标准库实现中的变量。\r\n\r\nSide effects:\r\n- Performance effects(性能影响):\r\n\r\n- Breaking backward compatibility(向后兼容性): \r\n\r\n---\r\n### Check List:\r\n- Please make sure your changes are compilable(请确保你的更改可以通过编译).\r\n- When providing us with a new feature, it is best to add related tests(如果你向我们增加一个新的功能, 请添加相关测试).\r\n- Please follow [Contributor Covenant Code of

What problem does this PR solve?\r\n\r\nIssue Number:\r\n\r\nProblem Summary:\r\n\r\n客户端使用libcurl请求brpc http服务端，偶现耗时超过1秒的现象。经排查，发现是libcurl当使用Post或者Put方法，请求体超过一定大小（一般是1024字节）时，libcurl 自动添加“Expect: 100-continue”请求头，先发送header，等到服务端确认能接收body，收到服务端的100 continue response或者超过1秒，才发送body部分数据给服务端。\r\n\r\n详细见[libcurl Expect 100-continue](https://everything.curl.dev/http/post/expect100) 和[rfc7231](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7231#section-5.1.1)。\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### What is changed and the side effects?\r\n\r\nChanged:\r\n\r\n1. 客户端组包的时候移除expect: 100-continue header。请求带上expect: 100-continue后，服务端可能会在收完header后先回100 continue response，等到收完body处理完再回200 ok response。brpc客户端不支持一个请求对应两个回包的场景。\r\n2. 服务端解包时解析出header，未收到body，先回100 continue response，等到收完body处理完再回200 ok response。\r\n\r\n\r\nSide effects:\r\n- Performance effects(性能影响):\r\n\r\n- Breaking backward compatibility(向后兼容性): \r\n\r\n---\r\n### Check List:\r\n- Please make sure your changes are compilable(请确保你的更改可以通过编译).\r\n- When providing us with a new feature, it is best to add related tests(如果你向我们增加一个新的功能, 请添加相关测试).\r\n- Please follow [Contributor Covenant Code of

What problem does this PR solve?\r\n\r\nIssue Number:\r\n\r\nProblem Summary: 此前遇到过IOBuf泄漏的情况，从heap profiler看到泄漏的位置是Socket读包的位置，实际上是因为IOBuf的tls缓存复用机制，掩盖了业务代码中存在IOBuf泄漏的问题。\r\n\r\n### What is changed and the side effects?\r\n\r\nChanged:\r\n\r\n受Contention Profiler启发，开发一个IOBuf Profiler，将未释放的IOBuf::Block的引用计数操作的调用栈及其操作数量（整数表示持有引用计数，负数表示释放引用计数）展示位调用图。通过可视化的方式，可快速定位到一些可能存在泄漏的模块，缩小排查的范围。\r\n\r\n因为数据上报有一定的顺序要求，所以没有使用Contention Profiler的方案（Collector）来上报数据，而是使用 #2492 封装的无锁队列来上报。 \r\n\r\n该工具可以扩展到其他引用计数相关的数据结构。\r\n\r\nSide effects:\r\n- Performance effects(性能影响):\r\n\r\n- Breaking backward compatibility(向后兼容性): \r\n\r\n---\r\n### Check List:\r\n- Please make sure your changes are compilable(请确保你的更改可以通过编译).\r\n- When providing us with a new feature, it is best to add related tests(如果你向我们增加一个新的功能, 请添加相关测试).\r\n- Please follow [Contributor Covenant Code of

What problem does this PR solve?\r\n\r\nIssue Number:\r\n\r\nProblem Summary:\r\n1. #2366 修复了HEAD请求的问题，但是一般情况下http service不会设置Content-Length，响应就不会包括Content-Length，没有达到HEAD请求的预期。\r\n2. #2319 保证了Content-Type在HttpHeader是唯一的，那么在解包的时候，就不需要设置两次Content-Type了。https://github.com/apache/brpc/blob/dc9e786fbb5fd79f08b49fa8d55ec4e1a35f2125/src/brpc/details/http_message.cpp#L139-L143\r\n\r\n### What is changed and the side effects?\r\n\r\nChanged:\r\n1. 当响应HEAD请求时，优先使用用户设置的Content-Length。如果用户没有设置Content-Length，则使用content的长度作为Content-Length的值。\r\n2. 删除HttpMessage::on_headers_complete中重复设置Content-Type的重复逻辑。\r\n\r\nSide effects:\r\n- Performance effects(性能影响):\r\n\r\n- Breaking backward compatibility(向后兼容性): \r\n\r\n---\r\n### Check List:\r\n- Please make sure your changes are compilable(请确保你的更改可以通过编译).\r\n- When providing us with a new feature, it is best to add related tests(如果你向我们增加一个新的功能, 请添加相关测试).\r\n- Please follow [Contributor
