Changes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The options <code>skip-stale-issue-message</code> and <code>skip-stale-pr-message</code> were removed. Instead, setting the options <code>stale-issue-message</code> and <code>stale-pr-message</code> will be enough to let the stale workflow add a comment. If the options are unset, a comment will not be added which was the equivalent of setting <code>skip-stale-issue-message</code> to <code>true</code>.</li>\n<li>The <code>operations-per-run</code> option will be more effective. After migrating, you could face a failed-fast process workflow if you let the default value (30) or set it to a small number. In that case, you will see a warning at the end of the logs (if enabled) indicating that the workflow was stopped sooner to avoid consuming too much API calls. In most cases, you can just increase this limit to make sure to process everything in a single run.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/actions/stale/commit/532554b8a8498a0e006fbcde824b048728c4178f\"><code>532554b</code></a> update Changelog</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/actions/stale/commit/aaab997ccea19e4bbf31972dde2a627199681ea4\"><code>aaab997</code></a> fix(options): add missing <code>close-issue-reason</code> option (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/stale/issues/772\">#772</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/actions/stale/commit/136efb520fcd6d07fdfefb7991cce1f7d20ea192\"><code>136efb5</code></a> docs: update example with new version of stale (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/stale/issues/765\">#765</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/actions/stale/commit/06d2a3904b77e3b34b74319855eebe4627488d19\"><code>06d2a39</code></a> Add close-issue-reason option (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/stale/issues/764\">#764</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/actions/stale/commit/29e800e1c8773dc43211940feace2dd392f6f403\"><code>29e800e</code></a> Remove stale when updated without comment (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/stale/issues/717\">#717</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/actions/stale/commit/6b7f9717b7927f32c4b3f2cdd437ba8b0bf595fb\"><code>6b7f971</code></a> build(deps): bump github/codeql-action from 1 to 2 (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/stale/issues/760\">#760</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/actions/stale/commit/6c298b192c80ba5f66c38f7e22d9979eafbd17bf\"><code>6c298b1</code></a> Update CONTRIBUTING.md</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/actions/stale/commit/c048b97ed380a75cfbb65aed443fb3f1300f8c2e\"><code>c048b97</code></a> Update CONTRIBUTING.md</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/actions/stale/commit/71b06d019425c06fe4ae135412631b70d83edea3\"><code>71b06d0</code></a> build(deps): bump actions/upload-artifact from 2 to 3 (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/stale/issues/762\">#762</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/actions/stale/commit/7bb514d8f820f61e17997cbaf248cbeef33c2bab\"><code>7bb514d</code></a> build(deps): bump actions/checkout from 2 to 3 (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/stale/issues/763\">#763</a>)</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/stale/compare/3cc123766321e9f15a6676375c154ccffb12a358...532554b8a8498a0e006fbcde824b048728c4178f\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=actions/stale&package-manager=github_actions&previous-version=5.0.0&new-version=5.1.0)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

Changes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The options <code>skip-stale-issue-message</code> and <code>skip-stale-pr-message</code> were removed. Instead, setting the options <code>stale-issue-message</code> and <code>stale-pr-message</code> will be enough to let the stale workflow add a comment. If the options are unset, a comment will not be added which was the equivalent of setting <code>skip-stale-issue-message</code> to <code>true</code>.</li>\n<li>The <code>operations-per-run</code> option will be more effective. After migrating, you could face a failed-fast process workflow if you let the default value (30) or set it to a small number. In that case, you will see a warning at the end of the logs (if enabled) indicating that the workflow was stopped sooner to avoid consuming too much API calls. In most cases, you can just increase this limit to make sure to process everything in a single run.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/actions/stale/commit/532554b8a8498a0e006fbcde824b048728c4178f\"><code>532554b</code></a> update Changelog</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/actions/stale/commit/aaab997ccea19e4bbf31972dde2a627199681ea4\"><code>aaab997</code></a> fix(options): add missing <code>close-issue-reason</code> option (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/stale/issues/772\">#772</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/actions/stale/commit/136efb520fcd6d07fdfefb7991cce1f7d20ea192\"><code>136efb5</code></a> docs: update example with new version of stale (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/stale/issues/765\">#765</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/actions/stale/commit/06d2a3904b77e3b34b74319855eebe4627488d19\"><code>06d2a39</code></a> Add close-issue-reason option (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/stale/issues/764\">#764</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/actions/stale/commit/29e800e1c8773dc43211940feace2dd392f6f403\"><code>29e800e</code></a> Remove stale when updated without comment (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/stale/issues/717\">#717</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/actions/stale/commit/6b7f9717b7927f32c4b3f2cdd437ba8b0bf595fb\"><code>6b7f971</code></a> build(deps): bump github/codeql-action from 1 to 2 (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/stale/issues/760\">#760</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/actions/stale/commit/6c298b192c80ba5f66c38f7e22d9979eafbd17bf\"><code>6c298b1</code></a> Update CONTRIBUTING.md</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/actions/stale/commit/c048b97ed380a75cfbb65aed443fb3f1300f8c2e\"><code>c048b97</code></a> Update CONTRIBUTING.md</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/actions/stale/commit/71b06d019425c06fe4ae135412631b70d83edea3\"><code>71b06d0</code></a> build(deps): bump actions/upload-artifact from 2 to 3 (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/stale/issues/762\">#762</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/actions/stale/commit/7bb514d8f820f61e17997cbaf248cbeef33c2bab\"><code>7bb514d</code></a> build(deps): bump actions/checkout from 2 to 3 (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/stale/issues/763\">#763</a>)</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/stale/compare/3cc123766321e9f15a6676375c154ccffb12a358...532554b8a8498a0e006fbcde824b048728c4178f\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=actions/stale&package-manager=github_actions&previous-version=5.0.0&new-version=5.1.0)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.
