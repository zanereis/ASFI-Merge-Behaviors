What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nImprovement on default branch for try suggestion.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhen we hit default branch in codeGen, we need to return a default value that would specify that we do not know the function, and not just a blank string.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNo branch hits this behaviour so far, but we need to safeguard from the possible errors.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSupport box plots with plotly backend on both Spark Connect and Spark classic.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhile Pandas on Spark supports plotting, PySpark currently lacks this feature. The proposed API will enable users to generate visualizations. This will provide users with an intuitive, interactive way to explore and understand large datasets directly from PySpark DataFrames, streamlining the data analysis workflow in distributed environments.\r\n\r\nSee more at [PySpark Plotting API Specification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IjOEzC8zcetG86WDvqkereQPj_NGLNW7Bdu910g30Dg/edit?usp=sharing) in progress.\r\n\r\nPart of https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-49530.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd parameter \"precision\" to pandas on Spark box plot.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nPreviously, the box method used **kwds, allowing precision to be passed implicitly. Now, adding precision directly to the signature ensures clarity and explicit control, improving usability.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to remove the constructors that accept a plan string as an error message, and leave only constructors with the error

shouldn't because the exception is supposed to raised by Spark.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the modified test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"core/testOnly

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWe use the `rel_path_to_root` Jekyll variable in front of all paths that require it.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently, our import to `main.js` and AnchorJS are broken in the Spark 4.0.0-2 preview. Also, images aren't appearing for the Structured Streaming doc pages. See the [ASF issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-49944) for more detail.\r\n\r\nYou can see how the pages are broken [here](https://spark.apache.org/docs/4.0.0-preview2/streaming/getting-started.html); here's a screenshot, for example:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1168\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d0dbc970-a5aa-445a-ae21-f4e32973f031\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nThe preview documentation will now have correctly rendered code blocks, and images will appear.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nLocal testing. Please build the docs site if you would like to verify. It now looks like:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1271\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08b69f58-d6f4-41b0-bcb5-1af80782c133\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR proposes not using session-level collation in DDL commands (create/alter view/table, add/replace columns).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe default collation for DDL commands should be tied to the object being created or altered (e.g., table, view, schema) rather than the session-level setting. Since object-level collations are not yet supported, we will assume the UTF8_BINARY collation by default for now.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new unit tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-10-12T21:28:49Z","updated_at":"2024-11-13T18:01:15Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48436/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48436/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48436/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/27059a8561f423b86af68a84620719bf004c7b2f","head":{"label":"stefankandic:fixSessionCollation","ref":"fixSessionCollation","sha":"27059a8561f423b86af68a84620719bf004c7b2f","user":{"login":"stefankandic","id":154237371,"node_id":"U_kgDOCTF5uw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/154237371?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic","html_url":"https://github.com/stefankandic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":734708961,"node_id":"R_kgDOK8rE4Q","name":"spark","full_name":"stefankandic/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"stefankandic","id":154237371,"node_id":"U_kgDOCTF5uw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/154237371?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic","html_url":"https://github.com/stefankandic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefankandic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/stefankandic/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to rename the `errorClass` to `condition` in errors in the JSON formats: `MINIMAL` and `STANDARD`.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"condition\" : \"DIVIDE_BY_ZERO\",\r\n  \"sqlState\" : \"22012\",\r\n  \"messageParameters\" : { \"config\" : \"CONFIG\"}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe name `condition` was taken because it is used the SQL standard:\r\n<img width=\"920\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-10-09 at 19 38 51\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd17ce98-3f99-4419-a3aa-927cf162d696\">\r\nand no need extra words as a suffix or prefix in the context of error message format.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo follow new naming convention introduced by https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/44902.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the affected tests:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.SQLQueryTestSuite\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis is a follow-up PR that reverts https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/48284 in the first commit and offers a new way to deal with the issue of conflicting CTE ids. This PR generates new CTE ids for conflicting ones and retains the pre  https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/48284 reference counting logic. See the the details in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/48284#issuecomment-2391887954.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe previous PR relied on the fact that nested, connected CTEs get flattened during resolution (see an example why it worked in a some cases: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/48284#issuecomment-2386982325), and so the remaining `WithCTE` nodes in the plan are surely self-contained. If we can't rely on that fact then we need a more robust solution.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, because currently some issues (https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/48284#issuecomment-2389011706) can come up with manually assembed plans only. (I think we should not consider an issue user-facing if it can't be reproduced with public APIs.)\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting and new UTs.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, 'HADOOP_CONF_DIR' in ENV and Hadoop configmap cannot be both configured. However, in cloud vendor EMR environments, 'HADOOP_CONF_DIR' is often already configured. This issue is introduced to preferentially use the configmap specified through the property spark.kubernetes.hadoop.configMapName without changing the environment variables.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nMore convenient to use in cloud vendor environments.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit testing.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-10-12T08:08:48Z","updated_at":"2024-12-11T16:41:14Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b95a898bcf4109c5baa9d256c3240865041cdd50","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605057,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/KUBERNETES","name":"KUBERNETES","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48427/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48427/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48427/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/750c58cbb5f8c2faade312be6660893eb702a890","head":{"label":"zgzzbws:prefer-config-map","ref":"prefer-config-map","sha":"750c58cbb5f8c2faade312be6660893eb702a890","user":{"login":"zgzzbws","id":17823788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODIzNzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17823788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zgzzbws","html_url":"https://github.com/zgzzbws","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zgzzbws/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zgzzbws/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zgzzbws/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zgzzbws/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zgzzbws/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zgzzbws/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zgzzbws/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zgzzbws/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zgzzbws/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":871505136,"node_id":"R_kgDOM_Ic8A","name":"spark","full_name":"zgzzbws/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zgzzbws","id":17823788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODIzNzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17823788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zgzzbws","html_url":"https://github.com/zgzzbws","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zgzzbws/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zgzzbws/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zgzzbws/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zgzzbws/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zgzzbws/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zgzzbws/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zgzzbws/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zgzzbws/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zgzzbws/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zgzzbws/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to ban call the method `SparkThrowable#getErrorClass`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAfter PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/48196, `SparkThrowable#getErrorClass` has been marked as `Deprecated`. In order to prevent future developers from calling `SparkThrowable#getErrorClass` again, which may require continuous fix and migration, calling `SparkThrowable#getErrorClass` is strictly prohibited as it will fail at the compilation level.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Pass GA.\r\n- Manually

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdd a new case in collation type casts for retrieving values from a map where the keys are collated strings. This will allow the literal key to be implicitly cast to the appropriate collation type used in the map.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nSo explicit collate is no longer needed when accessing map elements.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nNew unit test.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds SQL pipe syntax support for LIMIT/OFFSET and ORDER/SORT/CLUSTER/DISTRIBUTE BY.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCREATE TABLE t(x INT, y STRING) USING CSV;\r\nINSERT INTO t VALUES (0, 'abc'), (1, 'def');\r\n\r\nTABLE t\r\n|> ORDER BY x\r\n|> LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1\r\n\r\n1\tdef\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe SQL pipe operator syntax will let users compose queries in a more flexible fashion.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, see above.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a few unit test cases, but mostly relies on golden file test coverage. I did this to make sure the answers are correct as this feature is implemented and also so we can look at the analyzer output plans to ensure they look right as well.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo","created_at":"2024-10-10T16:47:07Z","updated_at":"2024-10-29T13:58:53Z","closed_at":"2024-10-18T05:54:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b205629aafe01333cda24e5f5b0ed139f88e185d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48413/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48413/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48413/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/67fd8cae2c9ca6d3d7dbb67eedebc702aea492fa","head":{"label":"dtenedor:pipe-order-by","ref":"pipe-order-by","sha":"67fd8cae2c9ca6d3d7dbb67eedebc702aea492fa","user":{"login":"dtenedor","id":99207096,"node_id":"U_kgDOBenHuA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99207096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor","html_url":"https://github.com/dtenedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":592933002,"node_id":"R_kgDOI1dwig","name":"spark","full_name":"dtenedor/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dtenedor","id":99207096,"node_id":"U_kgDOBenHuA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99207096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor","html_url":"https://github.com/dtenedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dtenedor/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nDocumentation change: the JAVA versions mentioned on the getting_started page of PySpark 3.5 are corrected (https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.5.3/api/python/getting_started/install.html#dependencies).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe original description \"PySpark requires Java 8 or later\" is incorrect since 3.5 does not support java prior to 8u371 anymore and the latest supported version is 17, the downloading page (https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.5.3/#downloading) however, does correctly state this. I thus corrected the mentioned java versions.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes\r\ndocumentation fix\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nManually\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative

needed?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/47430 attempted to set `containsNull = false` for `ArrayCompact` for further optimization, but in an incomplete way:\r\n\r\nThe `ArrayCompact` is a runtime replaceable expression, so will be replaced in optimizer, and cause the `containsNull` be reverted, e.g.\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nselect array_compact(array(1, null))\r\n```\r\n\r\nRule `ReplaceExpressions` changed `containsNull: false -> true`\r\n```\r\nold schema:\r\nStructField(array_compact(array(1, NULL)),ArrayType(IntegerType,false),false)\r\n\r\nnew

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n`CollectLimitExec` is used when a logical `Limit` and/or `Offset` operation is the final operator. Comparing to `GlobalLimitExec`, it can avoid shuffle data to a single output partition.\r\nBut when the dataset is collected as a Dataset of JSON strings. The `GlobalLimitExec` and `TakeOrderedAndProjectExec` are not able to applied since the `SpecialLimits` strategy cannot work as expected.\r\nHere is an example, following query is a simple select-limit query:\r\n```\r\nscala> spark.sql(\"select * from right_t limit 4\").explain\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\nCollectLimit 4\r\n+- Scan hive spark_catalog.default.right_t [id#23, name#24], HiveTableRelation [`spark_catalog`.`default`.`right_t`, org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.lazy.LazySimpleSerDe, Data Cols: [id#23, name#24], Partition Cols: []]\r\n```\r\nWhen we add `toJSON` method, the plan changed unexpected and introduced a shuffle.\r\n```\r\nscala> spark.sql(\"select * from right_t limit 4\").toJSON.explain\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\nAdaptiveSparkPlan isFinalPlan=false\r\n+- SerializeFromObject [staticinvoke(class org.apache.spark.unsafe.types.UTF8String, StringType, fromString, input[0, java.lang.String, true], true, false, true) AS value#34]\r\n   +- MapPartitions org.apache.spark.sql.Dataset$$Lambda/0x00000070021d8c58@5b17838a, obj#33: java.lang.String\r\n      +- DeserializeToObject createexternalrow(staticinvoke(class java.lang.Integer, ObjectType(class java.lang.Integer), valueOf, id#27, true, false, true), name#28.toString, StructField(id,IntegerType,true), StructField(name,StringType,true)), obj#32: org.apache.spark.sql.Row\r\n         +- GlobalLimit 4, 0\r\n            +- Exchange SinglePartition, ENSURE_REQUIREMENTS, [plan_id=42]\r\n               +- LocalLimit 4\r\n                  +- Scan hive spark_catalog.default.right_t [id#27, name#28], HiveTableRelation [`spark_catalog`.`default`.`right_t`, org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.lazy.LazySimpleSerDe, Data Cols: [id#27, name#28], \r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWithout this patching, the simple query \"select limit\" or \"select sort limit\" has to introduce a shuffle when return  content as JSON dataset. Both `CollectLimitExec` and `TakeOrderedAndProject` cannot be applied.\r\n`Dataset.toJSON` as a fundamental API causes to poor performance in many scenarios. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUT added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2024-10-10T07:06:08Z","updated_at":"2025-01-14T09:38:32Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6c92a7e1871563b5ea506ba28e170bd8445aacf3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48407/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48407/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48407/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3e083ffd04b879176fe4c178f82f6cb81133fb68","head":{"label":"LantaoJin:SPARK-49919","ref":"SPARK-49919","sha":"3e083ffd04b879176fe4c178f82f6cb81133fb68","user":{"login":"LantaoJin","id":1853780,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTM3ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1853780?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin","html_url":"https://github.com/LantaoJin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":90969496,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5MDk2OTQ5Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"LantaoJin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"LantaoJin","id":1853780,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTM3ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1853780?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin","html_url":"https://github.com/LantaoJin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/LantaoJin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR switches all calls to `SparkContext.getConf` that are read-only to use `SparkContext.conf` instead. The former method clones the conf, which is unnecessary when the caller only reads the conf. `SparkContext.conf` provides read-only access to the conf.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCloning the entire conf adds unnecessary CPU overhead due to copying, and GC overhead due to cleanup, and both affect tail latencies on certain workloads.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently, we use the internal byte representation to store state for stateful streaming operators in the StateStore. This PR introduces Avro serialization and deserialization capabilities in the RocksDBStateEncoder so that we can instead use Avro encoding to store state. This is currently enabled for the TransformWithState operator via SQLConf to support all functionality supported by TWS\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nUnsafeRow is an inherently unstable format that makes no guarantees of being backwards-compatible. Therefore, if the format changes between Spark releases, this could cause StateStore corruptions. Avro is more stable, and inherently enables schema evolution.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nAmended and added to unit tests\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn this PR, I introduced new exception to be thrown when there is a mismatch between type of the elements in the array column type, and the actual values of that column. Currently, this can happen in Postgres SQL when type of a column is \r\nreal[] (array of floats), and insert command provides real[][] (array of arrays of floats).\r\n\r\nIn our case, we are letting this to be converted to Spark SQL Types, and fail when trying to read it later. This PR is catching currently thrown internal exception (java.lang.ClassCastException) and re-throw a newly-introduced exception for this problem.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThrowing better exception that will help Spark user to better understand why the query failed.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting, and newly-added unit tests for Postgres.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFor additions, we omit the `Add` operation if the foldable ones finally result in 0, e.g. `-3 + a + 3` is simplified to `a` instead of `a + 0`.\r\nFor multiplication,\r\n- we simplify the expression to `Literal(0, dt)` if the foldable ones finally result in 0 && the expression itself isn't nullable\r\n- we omit the `Multiply` operation if the foldable ones finally result in 1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nImprove the simplicity of expression evaluation and the opportunities for predicates to be pushed down to data sources  \r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nno, the result shall be identical \r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1, Introduce a helper class `Lazy` to replace the lazy vals\r\n2, Fix a deadlock in subquery execution\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nwe observed a deadlock between `QueryPlan.canonicalized` and `QueryPlan.references`:\r\n\r\nThe main thread `TakeOrderedAndProject.doExecute` is trying to compute `outputOrdering`, it top-down traverse the tree, and requires the lock of `QueryPlan.canonicalized` in the path.\r\nIn this deadlock, it successfully obtained the lock of `WholeStageCodegenExec` and requires the lock of `HashAggregateExec`;\r\n\r\nConcurrently, a subquery execution thread is performing code generation and bottom-up traverses the tree via `def consume`, which checks `WholeStageCodegenExec.usedInputs` and refererences a lazy val `QueryPlan.references`. It requires the lock of `QueryPlan.references` in the path.\r\nIn this deadlock, it successfully obtained the lock of `HashAggregateExec` and requires the lock of `WholeStageCodegenExec`;\r\n\r\nThis is due to Scala's lazy val internally calls this.synchronized on the instance that contains the val. This creates a potential for deadlocks.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nno\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nmanually test:\r\n\r\nbefore the fix, the deadlock happened twice in first 20 runs;\r\nafter the fix, the deadlock didn't happen in consecutive 100+ runs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR removes ExperimentalMethod from SQL. This is the first extension point we had for Spark SQL. However it is has been superseded by SparkSessionExtensions, and it has some weird semantics due to its mutability.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSimplify how we can extend Spark SQL.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. It removes an extension point used by developers and/or very adventurous users.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-10-09T04:06:17Z","updated_at":"2025-01-20T00:24:36Z","closed_at":"2025-01-20T00:24:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nReduce the python worker error log of `test_toDF_with_schema_string`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhen I run the test locally\r\n```python\r\npython/run-tests -k --python-executables python3 --testnames 'pyspark.sql.tests.test_dataframe'\r\n```\r\n\r\nTwo assertions in `test_toDF_with_schema_string` generate too many python worker error logs (~1k lines), which easily exceed the limitation of terminal and make it hard to debug.\r\n\r\nSo I want to reduce the number of python workers in the two assertions.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nno, test only\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nmanually test, the logs will be reduced to ~200 lines\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nno\r\n","created_at":"2024-10-09T03:09:58Z","updated_at":"2024-10-10T00:32:21Z","closed_at":"2024-10-09T23:23:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f1705a2910aa50b4e14d82c6f4514239a459d4db","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48388/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48388/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48388/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3338ff49980edf177658c600797b3f8d7e558525","head":{"label":"zhengruifeng:test_to_df_error","ref":"test_to_df_error","sha":"3338ff49980edf177658c600797b3f8d7e558525","user":{"login":"zhengruifeng","id":7322292,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMjIyOTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7322292?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng","html_url":"https://github.com/zhengruifeng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":51584791,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MTU4NDc5MQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"zhengruifeng/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zhengruifeng","id":7322292,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMjIyOTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7322292?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng","html_url":"https://github.com/zhengruifeng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zhengruifeng/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nImprove Spark user experience by introducing a new error type: `CONFLICTING_DIRECTORY_STRUCTURES` for `PartitioningUtils`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`PartitioningUtils.parsePartitions(...)` uses an assertion to if partitions are misconfigured. We should use a proper error type for this case.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, the error will be nicer.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUpdated the existing tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\n`copilot.vim`.","created_at":"2024-10-08T08:08:49Z","updated_at":"2024-10-09T01:12:44Z","closed_at":"2024-10-09T01:12:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"eb2a839b18f516cc3b4d29f6bdf48d20d868d9e4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48383/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48383/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48383/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1fbcd6fb247bb0be98aa0d23a14d18e55bdab1ee","head":{"label":"vladimirg-db:vladimirg-db/introduce-conflicting-directory-structures-error","ref":"vladimirg-db/introduce-conflicting-directory-structures-error","sha":"1fbcd6fb247bb0be98aa0d23a14d18e55bdab1ee","user":{"login":"vladimirg-db","id":166514719,"node_id":"U_kgDOCezQHw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/166514719?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db","html_url":"https://github.com/vladimirg-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":833519707,"node_id":"R_kgDOMa6AWw","name":"spark","full_name":"vladimirg-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vladimirg-db","id":166514719,"node_id":"U_kgDOCezQHw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/166514719?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db","html_url":"https://github.com/vladimirg-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirg-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vladimirg-db/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to use different ShuffleOrigin for the shuffle required from stateful operators. \r\n\r\nSpark has been using ENSURE_REQUIREMENTS as ShuffleOrigin which is open for optimization e.g. AQE can adjust the shuffle spec. Quoting the code of ENSURE_REQUIREMENTS:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// Indicates that the shuffle operator was added by the internal `EnsureRequirements` rule. It\r\n// means that the shuffle operator is used to ensure internal data partitioning requirements and\r\n// Spark is free to optimize it as long as the requirements are still ensured.\r\ncase object ENSURE_REQUIREMENTS extends ShuffleOrigin\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut the distribution requirement for stateful operators is lot more strict - it has to use the all expressions to calculate the hash (for partitioning) and the number of shuffle partitions must be the same with the spec. This is because stateful operator assumes that there is 1:1 mapping between the partition for the operator and the \"physical\" partition for checkpointed state. That said, it is fragile if we allow any optimization to be made against shuffle for stateful operator.\r\n\r\nTo prevent this, this PR introduces a new ShuffleOrigin with note that the shuffle is not expected to be \"modified\".\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis exposes a possibility of broken state based on the contract. We introduced StatefulOpClusteredDistribution in similar reason.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew UT added.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-10-08T07:53:26Z","updated_at":"2024-10-10T00:52:09Z","closed_at":"2024-10-10T00:52:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f89dd38498e05d2586422521f9aa29384f01b040","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nEarlier, runtime errors in underlying libraries were not caught during runtime in the RegExpReplace expression. The underlying errors were thrown directly to the user. For example, it wouldn't be uncommon to see issues like `java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException: No group 3`. This PR introduces a change to catch these underlying issues and throw a SparkException instead which details the input on which the exception failed. The new Spark Exception looks something like `org.apache.spark.SparkException: Could not perform regexp_replace for source = <source>, pattern = \r\n<pattern>, replacement = <replacement> and position = <position>`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTwo reasons. First, the new exception details which row the given error occurred on, which makes it easier for the user to debug the query or Spark developers to identify bugs. Second, a Spark Exception is generally considered expected behavior indicating that there were no unintended issues in the query's execution.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, a better exception is thrown when RegExpReplace fails.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUnit test in both codegen as well as interpreted mode.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nReplace `TreeNode.allChildren` with identity map (which was `Set` previously) to avoid hashcode lazy evalution.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWe hit a deadlock between shuffle dependency initialization and explain string generation, in which both code paths trigger lazy variable instantiation while visiting some tree nodes in different orders and thus acquiring object locks in a reversed order.\r\n\r\nThe hashcode of plan node is implemented as lazy val. So the fix is to remove hash code computation from explain string generation so to break the chain of lazy variable instantiation.\r\n\r\n`TreeNode.allChildren` is only used in explain string generation and only require identity equality. This should be also a small perforamance improvement BTW.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNO\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nCurrent UTs\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNO\r\n","created_at":"2024-10-07T20:42:26Z","updated_at":"2024-10-08T00:24:34Z","closed_at":"2024-10-08T00:24:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a3895451f32d680540a212eb44b52d77684aee93","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48375/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48375/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48375/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9a0726383cb943c5978089ab1ed874fe3e50d865","head":{"label":"liuzqt:SPARK-49852","ref":"SPARK-49852","sha":"9a0726383cb943c5978089ab1ed874fe3e50d865","user":{"login":"liuzqt","id":22358241,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzU4MjQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22358241?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt","html_url":"https://github.com/liuzqt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":511387078,"node_id":"R_kgDOHnslxg","name":"spark","full_name":"liuzqt/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"liuzqt","id":22358241,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzU4MjQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22358241?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt","html_url":"https://github.com/liuzqt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzqt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/liuzqt/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR corrects an unintentional default behavior change from https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/39763\r\n\r\nThat PR introduced a new configuration, `spark.eventLog.includeTaskMetricsAccumulators`, to provide an ability for users to disable the redundant logging of task metrics information via the Accumulables field in the Spark event log task end logs.\r\n\r\nI made a mistake in updating that PR description and code from the original version: the description says that the intent is to not change out of the box behavior, but the actual flag default was the opposite.\r\n\r\nThis new PR corrects both the flag default and the flag description to reflect the original intent of not changing default behavior.\r\n\r\n### Why are

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn this PR I propose that we add classification of JDBC driver exception that represent syntax errors on external databases.\r\nQueries generated from Spark that are sent to connectors should never have syntax error, and always indicate to a bug in code.\r\n\r\nHaving this classification would greatly help in identifying bugs faster and improving quality.\r\n\r\nDocumentation about error codes for syntax errors:\r\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/errors-events/database-engine-events-and-errors-0-to-999?view=sql-server-ver16\r\nhttps://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/errcodes-appendix.html\r\nhttps://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-error-code-reference/\r\nhttps://www.h2database.com/javadoc/org/h2/api/ErrorCode.html\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. This gives customer more precise error message about issue being hit.\r\n2. Help identify bugs faster as syntax error thrown from jdbc connectors should never happen.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, previously customers would get `FAILED_JDBC. UNCLASSIFIED` or internal error when syntax error occurs in JDBC, whereas they will now get `FAILED_JDBC.SYNTAX_ERROR`\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nIntegration tests\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch moves `iterator.hasNext` into the try block of `tryWithSafeFinallyAndFailureCallbacks` in `FileFormatWriter.executeTask`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNot only `dataWriter.writeWithIterator(iterator)` causes error, `iterator.hasNext` could cause error like:\r\n\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.shuffle.FetchFailedException: Block shuffle_1_106_21 is corrupted but checksum verification passed\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs it is not wrapped in the try block, `abort` won't be called on the committer. But as `setupTask` is called, it is safer to call `abort` in any case that error happens after it.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds SQL pipe syntax support for the set operations: UNION, INTERSECT, EXCEPT, DISTINCT.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCREATE TABLE t(x INT, y STRING) USING CSV;\r\nINSERT INTO t VALUES (0, 'abc'), (1, 'def');\r\n\r\nTABLE t\r\n|> UNION ALL (SELECT * FROM t);\r\n\r\n0\tabc\r\n0\tabc\r\n1\tdef\r\n1\tdef\r\n1\tNULL\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe SQL pipe operator syntax will let users compose queries in a more flexible fashion.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, see above.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a few unit test cases, but mostly relies on golden file test coverage. I did this to make sure the answers are correct as this feature is implemented and also so we can look at the analyzer output plans to ensure they look right as well.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nPreviously, the executor failure tracking code was located at `ExecutorPodsAllocator`, which only takes effect when `spark.kubernetes.allocation.pods.allocator=direct`. https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/48344 moves the code to the `ExecutorPodsLifecycleManager` \r\nconsequently removes this limitation.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nKeep docs up-to-date with code.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, docs are updated.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nReview.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer

to maheshk114 for the initial investigation and the fix.\r\n\r\nThis PR fix a bug where the shuffle service's ID is kept among the block location list at the removing of a RDD block from a node. Before this change `StorageLevel.NONE` is used to notify about the block remove which causes the block manager master ignoring the update of the locations for shuffle service's IDs (for details please see the method `BlockManagerMasterEndpoint#updateBlockInfo()` and keep in mind `StorageLevel.NONE.useDisk` is `false`). But after this change only the replication count is set to 0 to notify the block remove so `StorageLevel#isValid` is still false but `storageLevel.useDisk` is kept as `true` this way the the shuffle service's ID will be removed from the block location list.\r\n\r\nIf the block location is not updated properly, then tasks fails with fetch failed exception. The tasks will try to read the RDD blocks from a node using external shuffle service. The read will fail, if the node is already decommissioned.\r\n\r\n```\r\nWARN BlockManager [Executor task launch worker for task 25.0 in stage 6.0 (TID 1567)]: Failed to fetch remote block rdd_5_25

Below is a explanation on the changes and rationale.\r\n\r\nNow for each changelog file, we put a \"version: uniqueId\" to its first line, from it's current version to the previous snapshot version. For each snapshot (zip) file, there is no change other than their name (`version_uniqueId.zip`), because snapshot files are single source of truth.\r\n\r\nIn addition to `LastCommitBasedCheckpointId, lastCommittedCheckpointId, loadedCheckpointId` added in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/47895#pullrequestreview-2349097435, also add a in-memory instance `lineagfeManager` that contains mapping information version to unique Id. This is useful when you reuse the same rocksDB instance in the executor, so you don't need to load the lineage from the changelog file again.\r\n      \r\n## RocksDB:\r\n#### Load\r\n- When `loadedVersion != version`, try to load a changelog file with `version_checkpointUniqueId.changelog`. There could be multiple cases:\r\n    1. Version corresponds to a zip file:\r\n        1. `version_uniqueId.zip`, this means (either changelog was not enabled, or it was enabled but version happens to be a checkpoint file), and previously query run ckpt v2\r\n        2. `version.zip`, this means (either changelog was not enabled, or it was enabled but version happens to be a checkpoint file), and previously query run ckpt v1\r\n    2. Version corresponds to a changelog file:\r\n        1. `version_uniqueId.changelog`, this means changelog was enabled, and previously query run ckpt v2\r\n        2. `version.changelog`, this means changelog was enabled, and previously query run ckpt v1\r\n\r\n- For case i.a, we construct a new empty lineage `(version, sessionCheckpointId)`. `version_uniqueId.changelog`.\r\n- For case ii.a, we read the lineage file stored in \r\n- For case i.b and ii.b, there is no need to load the lineage as they were not presented before, we just load the corresponding file without `uniqueId`, but newer files will be constructed with uniqueId.\r\n\r\ncheckpoint version v1 to checkpoint version v2.\r\n\r\nNext the code finds all snapshot version through file listing. When there are multiple snapshot files with the same version but different unique Id (main problem this project was trying to solve), the correct one will be loaded based on the checkpoint id.\r\n\r\nThen changelog is replayed with the awareness of lineage. The lineage is stored in memory for next load().\r\n\r\nLast, load the changelog writer for version + 1, and write the lineage (version + 1, sessionCheckpointId) to the first line of the file. While it seems that the lineage is written early, it is safe because the change log writer is not committed yet.\r\n\r\n- When `loadedVersion == version`, the same rocks db instance is reused and the lineage is stored in memory to `versionToUniqueIdLineage`.\r\n\r\n#### Commit\r\n- Also save `sessionCheckpointId` to `latestSnapshot`\r\n- Add `(newVersion, sessionCheckpointId)` to `versionToUniqueIdLineage`\r\n\r\n#### Abort\r\nAlso clear up `versionToUniqueIdLineage`\r\n\r\n\r\n## RocksDBFileManager:\r\n- A bunch of add-ups to make until code uniqueId aware. Now all places that return version returns a <version, Option[uniqueId]> pair, in v1 format, the option is None.\r\n- \r\n### deleteOldVersions:\r\nIf there are multiple `version_uniqueId1.zip`(changelog) and `versioion.uniqueId2.zip`, all are deleted.\r\n\r\n## Changelog Reader / Writer\r\nWe purpose to save the lineage to the first line of the changelog files.\r\n\r\nFor changelog reader, there is an abstract function `readLineage` created. In `RocksDBCheckpointManager.getChangelogReader` function, the `readLineage` will be called right after the initialization of the changelog reader to update the file pointer to after the lineage. Subsequent `getNext` function won't be affecter because of this.\r\n\r\nFor changelog writer, there is an abstract function `writeLineage` that writes the lineage. This function will be called before any actual changelog data is written in `RocksDB.load()`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR is intended to improve analyzer performance by skip applying the DeduplicateRelations rule when there is a guarantee that there are no duplicate relations present in the query plan, upfront.\r\n\r\nThe code changes involved are:\r\n1) Storing the MultiInstanceRelations present in a query plan, as a field in QueryExecution. \r\n2) If its possible to know the Relations which will be present in a query , before hand,  then a non empty relations set is passed to the constructor of QueryExecution.\r\n3) If it is known upfront that there will be duplicate relations, then an empty set is passed to the QueryExecution constructor.\r\n4)If the relations set is non empty, then a Marker Plan is put on the top node , before analysis. \r\n5) In the DedupRelations rule, the presence of marker plan tells the code, to skip applying the rule, removes the marker node, and stores the info in AnalysisContext , for subsequent iterations of the batch.  \r\n6) The reason for storing the info in Analysis Context is because, some rules like ( Windowing rules related) may strip the top node ( in this case the Marker node).\r\n7) For DataFrame apis involving only 1 dataset, there is a guarantee that duplicate relations cannot occur, so long as subqueries are not present in the projection or filter clause (which is easily determined using the bitmap  present in the Node) and so the existing relations set can be passed to the QueryExecution constructor, when creating new dataframes.\r\n8)   For operations like join/union etc where there are 2 datasets involved, if the intersection of the two sets is empty , then that should mean that duplicate relations are not possible, and we can pass set1 ++ set2 in the resultant QueryExecution\r\n9) If the above set1. intersect. set2 is non empty, implying duplicate relations, in which case QueryExecution will be passed an empty relations set.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe deduplication rule is an expensive rule due to its nature of detecting the duplicate relations and then altering the exprIDs  etc. There are situations which can tell, whether a given plan will have any duplicate relations or not. Based on that knowledge the rule can be skipped.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nexisting tests should pass. new tests will be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo","created_at":"2024-10-04T20:00:20Z","updated_at":"2025-01-15T16:04:20Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1405801475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/ML","name":"ML","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED
