(2024-03-15)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Upgraded Kotlin to 1.9.22</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Added extension properties forever, then, and, given to the Kotlin extension. This allows you to do e.g.:</p>\n<p>await.forever until { .. }</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Added shortcut for enabling logging. Before you had to do e.g.</p>\n<p>await()\n.with()\n.conditionEvaluationListener(new ConditionEvaluationLogger(log::info))\n.pollInterval(ONE_HUNDRED_MILLISECONDS)\n.until(logs::size, is(4));</p>\n<p>You can now instead use the &quot;logging&quot; shortcut:</p>\n<p>await()\n.with()\n.logging(log::info)\n.pollInterval(ONE_HUNDRED_MILLISECONDS)\n.until(logs::size, is(4));</p>\n<p>or simply &quot;.logging()&quot; for &quot;System.out&quot;.</p>\n<p>This shortcut has also been added globally:</p>\n<p>Awaitility.setLogging(log::info);</p>\n<p>or</p>\n<p>Awaitility.setDefaultLogging();</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improved lambda detection for Java 17 and Java 21</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Upgraded Groovy to 4.0.19</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/awaitility/awaitility/commit/ff13b724c45853c3becbec988a1447ac2508762d\"><code>ff13b72</code></a> [maven-release-plugin] prepare release awaitility-4.2.1</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/awaitility/awaitility/commit/f80c2996d96c81b203f0483a55adfcc200c2963c\"><code>f80c299</code></a> [ci skip] Preparing changelog for release</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/awaitility/awaitility/commit/4be5236649ef6b16e805137fa7be404ce4db3e09\"><code>4be5236</code></a> [ci skip] Fixed typo in changelog</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/awaitility/awaitility/commit/e15b97560d873a7a632dc7cfaabff6d2fea92f50\"><code>e15b975</code></a> Fixed failing tests</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/awaitility/awaitility/commit/7f7656e48377739cc41afdc60bf8f3c47135b196\"><code>7f7656e</code></a> Adding 17 and 21 to tests</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/awaitility/awaitility/commit/32eafb69b38ff87ba4fae8b133e0ccc9ffa1a126\"><code>32eafb6</code></a> Improved lambda detection and upgraded groovy/scala</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/awaitility/awaitility/commit/801293612b7a608d5e8c8ddce24b1398cdc4d2fe\"><code>8012936</code></a> Trying to fix failing test</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/awaitility/awaitility/commit/b01855d944d96d072e4e760e1f81afb78d12afe7\"><code>b01855d</code></a> Revert &quot;Added java 21 tests&quot;</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/awaitility/awaitility/commit/0e7dff0f0f36d50a88379ca810496ed91123aa83\"><code>0e7dff0</code></a> Revert &quot;Revert &quot;Use Duration factories in Durations.java (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/awaitility/awaitility/issues/268\">#268</a>)&quot;&quot;</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/awaitility/awaitility/commit/97076a9acea3b6c3a07eda72a52bfdc6a4df6200\"><code>97076a9</code></a> Added java 21 tests</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/awaitility/awaitility/compare/awaitility-4.2.0...awaitility-4.2.1\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=org.awaitility:awaitility&package-manager=maven&previous-version=4.2.0&new-version=4.2.1)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.
