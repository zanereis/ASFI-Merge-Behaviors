Description ##\r\ng5 instances are now available to the MXNet CI for testing on Ampere A10G GPUs (courtesy of PR https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet-ci/pull/43 from @josephevans). Taking advantage of that, this PR turns on g5 instance use by adding a `Python3: Ampere-GPU` job running on the g5 to the `unix-gpu` pipeline.   Since Ampere architecture GPUs use reduced-mantissa-width TF32 calculations by default on float32 datasets, this required some minor test tolerance adjustments.\r\n\r\nA `test_report_compute_capabilities` test was added that outputs the GPU compute capability to the log .  This should be helpful in debugging GPU test failures generally, and here confirms proper enablement of the arch-86 A10G GPU:\r\n```\r\n[2022-02-16T07:56:58.381Z] tests/python/gpu/test_operator_gpu.py::test_report_compute_capabilities = [86] PASSED [ 18%]\r\n```\r\n\r\nSide notes:\r\n\r\nUnrelated MXNet numpy issue `mxnet.numpy and numpy differ regarding binary op result type with broadcast 0-dim array input` https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/20898 was discovered in the process of this PR development and a temporary work-around is included.\r\n\r\nI encountered and fixed issues in how the test_rnn_layers_fp{16,32} tests are invoked.  Before the fix of this PR, ./tests/python/unittest/test_gluon_rnn.py::test_rnn_layers_fp16 was run on a GPU, even though the \"unittest\" path is supposed to be for cpu-only testing.  Also, ./tests/python/gpu/test_operator_gpu.py::test_rnn_layers_fp32, invoked via import, was run on a cpu, even though the \"gpu\" path was used.\r\n\r\nAfter encountering an error on test_countsketch, I supplied a fix for an out-of-bounds write in the backward kernel.  The operator is coded in the legacy operator style, and should be launching the kernels into the context's stream.  Instead, the operator currently launches kernels into the default stream and includes cudaDevicedSynchronizes. I stopped short of making those additional changes, feeling those changes should be a separate PR filed based on user interest.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [X] PR's title starts

Description ##\r\nReshape operators from both NDArray and NumPy modules of MXNet had no quantized version so if it appeared between two quantized operators data would have to be dequantized and quantized again after reshape (as shown on picture below with version after change as well). Goal was to create quantized reshape operator.\r\nPrevious version:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59651240/150377082-bf394c8d-6df5-45e0-a4b9-d4e39a1a1ce4.png)\r\nNew

[BUGFIX], [MODEL], [TUTORIAL], [FEATURE], [DOC], etc)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Instead of checking for arbitrary number of whitespace character in the regular expression, I strip the input so that only a single whitespace is left

Description ##\r\nRAdam optimizer Python implementation as requested in #9182\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [X] PR's title starts with a category (e.g. [BUGFIX], [MODEL], [TUTORIAL], [FEATURE], [DOC], etc)\r\n- [X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [X] All changes have test coverage\r\n- [X] Code is well-documented\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [X] RAdam optimizer with internal python doc.\r\n- [X] Basic test added to the appropriate python file. \r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- Default argument values `beta1, beta2, epsilon` are aligned with the current PyTorch implementation and both the Tensorflow and PyTorch implementations were referenced for the implementation.\r\n- Due to hardware restrictions I have not been able to run a proper test of the optimizer so if I could get some help with that, it would be appreciated.\r\n","created_at":"2021-11-29T14:53:03Z","updated_at":"2022-11-02T19:23:54Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"49a01a1f058537b1c011fae49f6be7c265e04e63","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"eric-haibin-lin","id":5545640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDU2NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5545640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NzQ4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-testing","name":"pr-awaiting-testing","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"PR

To ensure the correctness of conversion of any model and operator, the complete type information must be present. This PR (in addition to numerous fixes) introduces backward-incompatible changes in order to eliminate any assumptions.\r\n\r\n#### Changes in the user API\r\n\r\nThe user will have to provide information about the data types of the model inputs.\r\n\r\nIn MXNet 2.0, the main function for model conversion should be `convert_hybrid_block`. Since the type information will usually be derived from some data example, the user should provide the data example itself. The previous implementation required the model to be hybridized and run at least once before conversion (so the graph is created). This requirement can be now removed since with a data example, the graph can be generated inside `convert_hybrid_block` (if it is not already present). \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the `cast_optional_params` was renamed to: `cast_params_offline` which I believe is more descriptive.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```python\r\ndef convert_hybrid_block(block, target_dtype=\"float16\", target_dtype_ops=None,\r\n                         fp32_ops=None, conditional_fp32_ops=None,\r\n                         excluded_sym_names=None, device=gpu(0),\r\n                         cast_optional_params=False):\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n```python\r\ndef convert_hybrid_block(block, data_example, target_dtype=\"float16\", target_dtype_ops=None,\r\n                         fp32_ops=None, conditional_fp32_ops=None,\r\n                         excluded_sym_names=[], device=gpu(0),\r\n                         cast_params_offline=False):\r\n```\r\n\r\n`convert_model` and `convert_symbol` must also be changed accordingly:\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```python\r\ndef convert_model(sym, arg_params, aux_params, target_dtype=\"float16\", target_dtype_ops=None,\r\n                  fp32_ops=None, conditional_fp32_ops=None, excluded_sym_names=None,\r\n                  cast_optional_params=False):\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n```python\r\ndef convert_model(sym, arg_params, aux_params, input_dtypes, target_dtype=\"float16\",\r\n                  target_dtype_ops=None, fp32_ops=None, conditional_fp32_ops=None,\r\n                  excluded_sym_names=[], cast_params_offline=False):\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere the `input_dtypes` is expected to be a dictionary, mapping names of model inputs to their types.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```python\r\ndef convert_symbol(sym, target_dtype=\"float16\", target_dtype_ops=None,\r\n                   fp32_ops=None, conditional_fp32_ops=None,\r\n                   excluded_sym_names=None, data_names=None,\r\n                   cast_optional_params=False):\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n```python\r\ndef convert_symbol(sym, input_dtypes, param_dtypes, target_dtype=\"float16\", target_dtype_ops=None,\r\n                   fp32_ops=None, conditional_fp32_ops=None, excluded_sym_names=[],\r\n                   cast_params_offline=False):\r\n```\r\n\r\nSimilarly, `convert_symbol` will now require `input_dtypes` as well as `param_dtypes`, which will also be a dictionary, mapping names of model parameters to their types.\r\n\r\n#### Changes in behavior\r\n\r\nSince we now have full information about the model types, the operator `amp_multicast`, which previously introduced a lot of uncertainty about the types of layers it preceded, and which had to be handled using (excessive) `amp_cast` nodes, will never be needed now. It will be replaced by multiple `amp_cast` nodes (only for tensors that need the casting), which can be then usually fused with oneDNN-optimized nodes using the `ONEDNN_AMP` pass (if the model was first optimized for the `ONEDNN` backend).\r\n\r\nBecause `amp_multicast` will not be used, the problem with offline casting of parameters discussed below is no longer

PR fixes a few issues with CI/CD:\r\n\r\n1. When multiple processes are attempting to install a pip package at the same time, there is a race condition that causes them to fail intermittently. Since website s3 push and publish is not run inside a container, just use the awscli installed in the jenkins slave (which is up-to-date.) \r\n2. Remove the onednn repository after installing onednn. This change prevents all CI pipelines from failing in case the onednn repository gets corrupt (or sync issues), since any apt calls will fail. \r\n3. Update CUDA architectures built for Windows. Include 7.5 for Turing (which are on g4 instances,) so we can migrate to these instances for Windows
