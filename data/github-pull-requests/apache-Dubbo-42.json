[dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-06-01T01:34:21Z","updated_at":"2021-06-01T06:27:00Z","closed_at":"2021-06-01T06:27:00Z","merged_at":"2021-06-01T06:27:00Z","merge_commit_sha":"2755cc88bf076407418a9a41e562a5553a2428f6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7940/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7940/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7940/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/d8795310f7c493843aa1bd1bfc9031b7f98a5cd7","head":{"label":"xiaoheng1:up-dev-dubbo-protocol","ref":"up-dev-dubbo-protocol","sha":"d8795310f7c493843aa1bd1bfc9031b7f98a5cd7","user":{"login":"xiaoheng1","id":12539730,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTM5NzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12539730?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1","html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoheng1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":187745345,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODc3NDUzNDU=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"xiaoheng1/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xiaoheng1","id":12539730,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTM5NzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12539730?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1","html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoheng1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoheng1/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-05-31T12:14:24Z","updated_at":"2021-06-01T15:20:10Z","closed_at":"2021-06-01T15:20:09Z","merged_at":"2021-06-01T15:20:09Z","merge_commit_sha":"ee4d90910a7bc2210eb1b9c06629ccff6b0840c1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7938/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7938/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7938/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/3118a21616f2f2c73f45b825104388af37354a57","head":{"label":"xiaoheng1:up-dev-issue-7936-3.0","ref":"up-dev-issue-7936-3.0","sha":"3118a21616f2f2c73f45b825104388af37354a57","user":{"login":"xiaoheng1","id":12539730,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTM5NzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12539730?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1","html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoheng1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":187745345,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODc3NDUzNDU=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"xiaoheng1/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xiaoheng1","id":12539730,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTM5NzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12539730?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1","html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoheng1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoheng1/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-05-31T03:31:52Z","updated_at":"2021-05-31T04:06:02Z","closed_at":"2021-05-31T04:06:02Z","merged_at":"2021-05-31T04:06:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"6491954284e4a23d393c3da7780f0866f9075f53","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7930/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7930/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7930/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/114c4663a1fb3b013fba893a1f3f456df9b86cba","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:zk_ut_fix_0531","ref":"zk_ut_fix_0531","sha":"114c4663a1fb3b013fba893a1f3f456df9b86cba","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

 增加redisRegistry consumer侧的服务探活逻辑\r\n\r\n目前redisRegistry的实现中，provider异常（未执行注销逻辑，如被kill -9）下线，只在`monitoring center`存在的情况下会对过期的provider进行下线操作，这有两个缺点：\r\n- monitoring center不一定会部署\r\n- 它的实现使用了keys，会阻塞redis； -> 更新：最新版本使用scan扫描，不会阻塞redis\r\n\r\n## 解法：\r\n在consumer侧对订阅到的服务进行检查，每隔 `1/2 session` 时间检查provider是否过期，如果过期，对它执行`doNotify`，即重新从redis获取最新数据，验证过期时间。\r\n\r\n## 验证：\r\n- 旧逻辑：使用redisRegistry，启动2个provider，1个consumer，对其中1个provider执行kill -9，consumer调用会有部分请求报错。\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6935924/120133031-f8ccf380-c1fd-11eb-84bf-ffccf6925f56.png)\r\n\r\n- 新逻辑：使用redisRegistry，启动2个provider，1个consumer，对其中1个provider执行kill -9，consumer会在`1/2 session`时间（默认30s，可配置）内将有问题的provider踢掉。\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6935924/120133334-8e688300-c1fe-11eb-9a1c-d43159ba83ab.png)\r\n\r\nnotify日志可以看出只有1个provider了\r\n\r\n```\r\n2021-05-31

 增加redisRegistry consumer侧的服务探活逻辑\r\n\r\n目前redisRegistry的实现中，provider异常（未执行注销逻辑，如被kill -9）下线，只在`monitoring center`存在的情况下会对过期的provider进行下线操作，这有两个缺点：\r\n- monitoring center不一定会部署\r\n- 它的实现使用了keys，会阻塞redis\r\n\r\n## 解法：\r\n在consumer侧对订阅到的服务进行检查，每隔 `1/2 session` 时间检查provider是否过期，如果过期，对它执行`doNotify`，即重新从redis获取最新数据，验证过期时间。\r\n\r\n## 验证：\r\n- 旧逻辑：使用redisRegistry，启动2个provider，1个consumer，对其中1个provider执行kill -9，consumer调用会有部分请求报错。\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6935924/120133031-f8ccf380-c1fd-11eb-84bf-ffccf6925f56.png)\r\n\r\n- 新逻辑：使用redisRegistry，启动2个provider，1个consumer，对其中1个provider执行kill -9，consumer会在`1/2 session`时间（默认30s，可配置）内将有问题的provider踢掉。\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6935924/120133334-8e688300-c1fe-11eb-9a1c-d43159ba83ab.png)\r\n`2021-05-31 10:52:45,312

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-05-30T12:31:30Z","updated_at":"2021-06-01T15:00:38Z","closed_at":"2021-06-01T15:00:38Z","merged_at":"2021-06-01T15:00:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"41d36a26b0476092ad363ff3a60e9e76cd8fbabf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7926/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7926/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7926/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/e67ae840493c6e310642989b29740c1cdcc33103","head":{"label":"icankeep:up-dev-issue#7925","ref":"up-dev-issue#7925","sha":"e67ae840493c6e310642989b29740c1cdcc33103","user":{"login":"icankeep","id":39434627,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDM0NjI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39434627?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep","html_url":"https://github.com/icankeep","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":363054123,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNjMwNTQxMjM=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"icankeep/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"icankeep","id":39434627,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDM0NjI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39434627?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep","html_url":"https://github.com/icankeep","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/icankeep/dubbo","description":"Apache

Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large,

Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-05-30T09:12:58Z","updated_at":"2021-05-31T02:22:43Z","closed_at":"2021-05-31T02:22:43Z","merged_at":"2021-05-31T02:22:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"af80a897617008f61a398e95aee126603ee3225d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7922/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7922/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7922/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/6562935fae20bc558a36df3e51a03aa1eef04328","head":{"label":"icankeep:up-dev-issue#7921","ref":"up-dev-issue#7921","sha":"6562935fae20bc558a36df3e51a03aa1eef04328","user":{"login":"icankeep","id":39434627,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDM0NjI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39434627?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep","html_url":"https://github.com/icankeep","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":363054123,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNjMwNTQxMjM=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"icankeep/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"icankeep","id":39434627,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDM0NjI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39434627?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep","html_url":"https://github.com/icankeep","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/icankeep/dubbo","description":"Apache

Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large,

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to

Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-05-28T13:52:33Z","updated_at":"2021-07-16T07:36:45Z","closed_at":"2021-06-24T08:06:42Z","merged_at":"2021-06-24T08:06:42Z","merge_commit_sha":"99ccb57025e2b1cf56e1155a67c801702b589670","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7908/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7908/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7908/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/ea475cedc6193cf1571dfdf6d7b25117cd263846","head":{"label":"jingxiang:bugfix_#7907","ref":"bugfix_#7907","sha":"ea475cedc6193cf1571dfdf6d7b25117cd263846","user":{"login":"jingxiang","id":1510149,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTAxNDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1510149?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingxiang","html_url":"https://github.com/jingxiang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingxiang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingxiang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingxiang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingxiang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingxiang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingxiang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingxiang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingxiang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingxiang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":371703147,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzE3MDMxNDc=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"jingxiang/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jingxiang","id":1510149,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTAxNDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1510149?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingxiang","html_url":"https://github.com/jingxiang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingxiang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingxiang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingxiang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingxiang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingxiang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingxiang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingxiang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingxiang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingxiang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jingxiang/dubbo","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-05-28T10:03:51Z","updated_at":"2021-05-29T09:20:27Z","closed_at":"2021-05-29T09:20:27Z","merged_at":"2021-05-29T09:20:27Z","merge_commit_sha":"e2268238b4190feb287af4d22f9fd2efac5b510f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7905/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7905/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7905/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/67cd462727a584ef677848a82c14f5c5a23e255b","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:opt_thread_name","ref":"opt_thread_name","sha":"67cd462727a584ef677848a82c14f5c5a23e255b","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-05-28T06:54:09Z","updated_at":"2021-08-12T03:46:00Z","closed_at":"2021-05-31T02:12:35Z","merged_at":"2021-05-31T02:12:35Z","merge_commit_sha":"ad824676fba13af8e5abdc2bb5a4f8ae969d8b13","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7902/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7902/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7902/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/efd84a314da1eb4f5059800e140a516b1e8b88ba","head":{"label":"zhongxiongzeng:dev/p-2105-code-review","ref":"dev/p-2105-code-review","sha":"efd84a314da1eb4f5059800e140a516b1e8b88ba","user":{"login":"zhongxiongzeng","id":41657421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNjU3NDIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41657421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongxiongzeng","html_url":"https://github.com/zhongxiongzeng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongxiongzeng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongxiongzeng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongxiongzeng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongxiongzeng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongxiongzeng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongxiongzeng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongxiongzeng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongxiongzeng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongxiongzeng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":365109755,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNjUxMDk3NTU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"zhongxiongzeng/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zhongxiongzeng","id":41657421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNjU3NDIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41657421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongxiongzeng","html_url":"https://github.com/zhongxiongzeng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongxiongzeng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongxiongzeng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongxiongzeng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongxiongzeng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongxiongzeng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongxiongzeng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongxiongzeng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongxiongzeng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongxiongzeng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zhongxiongzeng/dubbo","description":"Apache

changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to

and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-05-27T16:01:34Z","updated_at":"2021-05-28T09:44:55Z","closed_at":"2021-05-28T09:44:55Z","merged_at":"2021-05-28T09:44:55Z","merge_commit_sha":"515699b6657e1abbb8780b98b81a81a97d428dcd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7893/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7893/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7893/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/6637a0a4a35f86a5025378f0f4b57af9c5372cd4","head":{"label":"luox2:add_apolloDynamicConfiguration","ref":"add_apolloDynamicConfiguration","sha":"6637a0a4a35f86a5025378f0f4b57af9c5372cd4","user":{"login":"luox2","id":11802777,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODAyNzc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11802777?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/luox2","html_url":"https://github.com/luox2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luox2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luox2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luox2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luox2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luox2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luox2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luox2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luox2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luox2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":367778415,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNjc3Nzg0MTU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"luox2/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"luox2","id":11802777,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODAyNzc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11802777?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/luox2","html_url":"https://github.com/luox2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luox2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luox2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luox2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luox2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luox2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luox2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luox2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luox2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luox2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/luox2/dubbo","description":"Apache

ConfigManager/DubboBootstrap \r\nHandle external config in DubboBootstrap, disable DubboConfigConfiguration \r\nIntroduce app config to Environment (for bring props from Spring Environment)\r\nImprove config metadata\r\nImprove config refresh (include config prefix and id handling)\r\nUse checkDefault() method to initialize default value after refresh \r\nImprove system properties handling in tests\r\nDisable DubboLifecycleComponentApplicationListener\r\n\r\ndubbo spring boot:\r\nRemove default property \"spring.main.allow-bean-definition-overriding\" \r\n\r\n## Verifying this

[GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-05-27T12:02:34Z","updated_at":"2021-05-31T02:17:24Z","closed_at":"2021-05-31T02:17:24Z","merged_at":"2021-05-31T02:17:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"4af7d632efcbd9f351a5ecc7fa7506d33dab9452","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7889/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7889/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7889/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/c76d93d88590390ce3919b0344f1757cc1584ed2","head":{"label":"xiaoheng1:up-dev-issue#7888","ref":"up-dev-issue#7888","sha":"c76d93d88590390ce3919b0344f1757cc1584ed2","user":{"login":"xiaoheng1","id":12539730,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTM5NzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12539730?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1","html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoheng1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":187745345,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODc3NDUzNDU=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"xiaoheng1/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xiaoheng1","id":12539730,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTM5NzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12539730?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1","html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoheng1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoheng1/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-05-27T07:35:25Z","updated_at":"2021-05-28T06:10:11Z","closed_at":"2021-05-28T06:10:11Z","merged_at":"2021-05-28T06:10:11Z","merge_commit_sha":"a21a885fd490a2f6f319c1585b0fa6191832c0cf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7885/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7885/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7885/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/c935fc7b798f77409022cb06384b085092ced096","head":{"label":"zhongxiongzeng:dev/p-2105-code-improve","ref":"dev/p-2105-code-improve","sha":"c935fc7b798f77409022cb06384b085092ced096","user":{"login":"zhongxiongzeng","id":41657421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNjU3NDIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41657421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongxiongzeng","html_url":"https://github.com/zhongxiongzeng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongxiongzeng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongxiongzeng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongxiongzeng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongxiongzeng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongxiongzeng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongxiongzeng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongxiongzeng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongxiongzeng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongxiongzeng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":365109755,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNjUxMDk3NTU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"zhongxiongzeng/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zhongxiongzeng","id":41657421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNjU3NDIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41657421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongxiongzeng","html_url":"https://github.com/zhongxiongzeng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongxiongzeng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongxiongzeng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongxiongzeng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongxiongzeng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongxiongzeng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongxiongzeng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongxiongzeng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongxiongzeng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhongxiongzeng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zhongxiongzeng/dubbo","description":"Apache

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-05-27T05:49:48Z","updated_at":"2021-05-28T14:36:57Z","closed_at":"2021-05-27T08:24:47Z","merged_at":"2021-05-27T08:24:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"fa8a46b4d8a12a2772bbf919767f3a95ea142d02","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/38","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/38","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/38/labels","id":6734149,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNjczNDE0OQ==","number":38,"title":"2.7.12","description":"","creator":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":17,"state":"closed","created_at":"2021-05-06T17:13:46Z","updated_at":"2021-06-10T09:19:53Z","due_on":"2021-06-08T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2021-06-10T09:19:53Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7884/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7884/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7884/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/d2def7b0f042d2dc16e73b77fa08cc0733411ce7","head":{"label":"pinxiong:issue#2796","ref":"issue#2796","sha":"d2def7b0f042d2dc16e73b77fa08cc0733411ce7","user":{"login":"pinxiong","id":7067417,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNjc0MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7067417?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong","html_url":"https://github.com/pinxiong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":349733065,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDk3MzMwNjU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"pinxiong/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"pinxiong","id":7067417,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNjc0MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7067417?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong","html_url":"https://github.com/pinxiong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/pinxiong/dubbo","description":"Apache

[GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-05-27T03:52:25Z","updated_at":"2021-06-10T02:32:01Z","closed_at":"2021-06-08T09:58:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7453f7b21b5e9cb0e3824ad4d26d665c6cf12188","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":699741254,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTk3NDEyNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/labels/status/waiting-for-feedback","name":"status/waiting-for-feedback","color":"C2E0C6","default":false,"description":"Need

change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-05-27T03:35:00Z","updated_at":"2021-05-28T10:08:36Z","closed_at":"2021-05-28T10:08:36Z","merged_at":"2021-05-28T10:08:36Z","merge_commit_sha":"f26ba91b67f642148a10d3b197502e29928b77bf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7881/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7881/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7881/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/6d19bafcb7935134c95652e14a4d5321eb17ff8b","head":{"label":"ZiyunYang:yzy-master","ref":"yzy-master","sha":"6d19bafcb7935134c95652e14a4d5321eb17ff8b","user":{"login":"ZiyunYang","id":47910618,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3OTEwNjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47910618?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyunYang","html_url":"https://github.com/ZiyunYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyunYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyunYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyunYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyunYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyunYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyunYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyunYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyunYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyunYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":371212744,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzEyMTI3NDQ=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"ZiyunYang/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ZiyunYang","id":47910618,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3OTEwNjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47910618?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyunYang","html_url":"https://github.com/ZiyunYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyunYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyunYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyunYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyunYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyunYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyunYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyunYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyunYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZiyunYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ZiyunYang/dubbo","description":"Apache

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-05-26T12:36:35Z","updated_at":"2021-05-28T01:45:25Z","closed_at":"2021-05-28T01:45:25Z","merged_at":"2021-05-28T01:45:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"d401760a704162921fa3c158538a93dfdfab3faf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7874/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7874/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7874/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/ec05e9e8159a4b8fd5ef8456f0d222601084df7c","head":{"label":"xiaoheng1:up-dev-issue#7872","ref":"up-dev-issue#7872","sha":"ec05e9e8159a4b8fd5ef8456f0d222601084df7c","user":{"login":"xiaoheng1","id":12539730,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTM5NzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12539730?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1","html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoheng1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":187745345,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODc3NDUzNDU=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"xiaoheng1/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xiaoheng1","id":12539730,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTM5NzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12539730?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1","html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoheng1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoheng1/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-05-26T04:55:54Z","updated_at":"2021-05-28T01:37:39Z","closed_at":"2021-05-28T01:37:39Z","merged_at":"2021-05-28T01:37:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"12df85565d429cb05a3281f6504179f24f5bf309","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7863/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7863/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7863/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/79992c773dcd5ba94e139de39784bf32a404551c","head":{"label":"icankeep:up-dev-issue#7862","ref":"up-dev-issue#7862","sha":"79992c773dcd5ba94e139de39784bf32a404551c","user":{"login":"icankeep","id":39434627,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDM0NjI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39434627?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep","html_url":"https://github.com/icankeep","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":363054123,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNjMwNTQxMjM=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"icankeep/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"icankeep","id":39434627,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDM0NjI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39434627?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep","html_url":"https://github.com/icankeep","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/icankeep/dubbo","description":"Apache

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-05-26T00:23:48Z","updated_at":"2021-05-27T03:14:14Z","closed_at":"2021-05-27T03:14:14Z","merged_at":"2021-05-27T03:14:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"d6d8d25d2ee2eefbb82943296a90031ba559d87b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7861/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7861/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7861/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/53694fe839a374eb4934ac987e42fa22bb5c4e3a","head":{"label":"icankeep:up-dev-issue#7843","ref":"up-dev-issue#7843","sha":"53694fe839a374eb4934ac987e42fa22bb5c4e3a","user":{"login":"icankeep","id":39434627,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDM0NjI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39434627?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep","html_url":"https://github.com/icankeep","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":363054123,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNjMwNTQxMjM=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"icankeep/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"icankeep","id":39434627,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDM0NjI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39434627?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep","html_url":"https://github.com/icankeep","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/icankeep/dubbo","description":"Apache

quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-05-25T12:42:14Z","updated_at":"2024-08-20T08:45:54Z","closed_at":"2021-05-28T01:33:53Z","merged_at":"2021-05-28T01:33:53Z","merge_commit_sha":"fb2fa0a51e37fb42cd27d23b0cede8c3339a73b4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/38","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/38","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/38/labels","id":6734149,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNjczNDE0OQ==","number":38,"title":"2.7.12","description":"","creator":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":17,"state":"closed","created_at":"2021-05-06T17:13:46Z","updated_at":"2021-06-10T09:19:53Z","due_on":"2021-06-08T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2021-06-10T09:19:53Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7860/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7860/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7860/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/10e003fa518e72e1c560c1673fd9910ee2c9663c","head":{"label":"CrazyHZM:feature/customize_merge_url","ref":"feature/customize_merge_url","sha":"10e003fa518e72e1c560c1673fd9910ee2c9663c","user":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":152715619,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTI3MTU2MTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"CrazyHZM/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM/dubbo","description":"Apache

Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-05-24T13:17:33Z","updated_at":"2021-05-25T12:40:16Z","closed_at":"2021-05-25T12:40:16Z","merged_at":"2021-05-25T12:40:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"2dace545c452e2bea58d3ea35124d68e1d1dfb06","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7855/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7855/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7855/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/660c550816732947587ca162877c2ad095333f97","head":{"label":"xiaoheng1:up-dev-issue#7854","ref":"up-dev-issue#7854","sha":"660c550816732947587ca162877c2ad095333f97","user":{"login":"xiaoheng1","id":12539730,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTM5NzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12539730?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1","html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoheng1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":187745345,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODc3NDUzNDU=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"xiaoheng1/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xiaoheng1","id":12539730,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTM5NzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12539730?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1","html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoheng1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoheng1/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-05-24T03:17:36Z","updated_at":"2021-05-24T03:54:12Z","closed_at":"2021-05-24T03:54:12Z","merged_at":"2021-05-24T03:54:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"845003f500fa3bb0ac3f1bf41ee4d55b71720fa8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7850/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7850/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7850/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/c7b03341534222223550b635b4ae19f349abecd8","head":{"label":"panxiaojun233:3.0-fix-loop","ref":"3.0-fix-loop","sha":"c7b03341534222223550b635b4ae19f349abecd8","user":{"login":"panxiaojun233","id":43985911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTg1OTEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43985911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/panxiaojun233","html_url":"https://github.com/panxiaojun233","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panxiaojun233/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panxiaojun233/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panxiaojun233/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panxiaojun233/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panxiaojun233/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panxiaojun233/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panxiaojun233/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panxiaojun233/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panxiaojun233/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":292961759,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTI5NjE3NTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"panxiaojun233/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"panxiaojun233","id":43985911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTg1OTEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43985911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/panxiaojun233","html_url":"https://github.com/panxiaojun233","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panxiaojun233/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panxiaojun233/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panxiaojun233/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panxiaojun233/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panxiaojun233/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panxiaojun233/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panxiaojun233/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panxiaojun233/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panxiaojun233/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/panxiaojun233/dubbo","description":"Apache

contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

-->\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-05-23T15:44:04Z","updated_at":"2021-05-28T01:32:02Z","closed_at":"2021-05-28T01:32:02Z","merged_at":"2021-05-28T01:32:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"537755bf1b092f3aa196119269458c92ec05e89c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7845/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7845/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7845/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/d37a7654c9094c8ea0e3cb8e7b225ee64e861b79","head":{"label":"icankeep:3.0-up-dev-issue#7842","ref":"3.0-up-dev-issue#7842","sha":"d37a7654c9094c8ea0e3cb8e7b225ee64e861b79","user":{"login":"icankeep","id":39434627,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDM0NjI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39434627?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep","html_url":"https://github.com/icankeep","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":363054123,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNjMwNTQxMjM=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"icankeep/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"icankeep","id":39434627,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDM0NjI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39434627?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep","html_url":"https://github.com/icankeep","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/icankeep/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nsee more information from #7813\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-05-23T11:11:22Z","updated_at":"2021-05-23T13:15:32Z","closed_at":"2021-05-23T13:15:32Z","merged_at":"2021-05-23T13:15:31Z","merge_commit_sha":"3a8f44eb380077eb34132fa4238e1dd36fa28213","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7839/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7839/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7839/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/87bd8c04d421684e01d85badebdde7833807a969","head":{"label":"icankeep:3.0-up-dev-issue#7813","ref":"3.0-up-dev-issue#7813","sha":"87bd8c04d421684e01d85badebdde7833807a969","user":{"login":"icankeep","id":39434627,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDM0NjI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39434627?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep","html_url":"https://github.com/icankeep","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":363054123,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNjMwNTQxMjM=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"icankeep/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"icankeep","id":39434627,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDM0NjI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39434627?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep","html_url":"https://github.com/icankeep","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/icankeep/dubbo","description":"Apache

sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-05-23T11:08:24Z","updated_at":"2021-05-23T13:14:04Z","closed_at":"2021-05-23T13:14:04Z","merged_at":"2021-05-23T13:14:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"30b311a0c372ef5b835827711b38b91c0a27852a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7838/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7838/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7838/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/1f0da8d4d06b1b5bfeebb034dd0f90134d06354b","head":{"label":"icankeep:3.0-up-dev-issue#7794","ref":"3.0-up-dev-issue#7794","sha":"1f0da8d4d06b1b5bfeebb034dd0f90134d06354b","user":{"login":"icankeep","id":39434627,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDM0NjI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39434627?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep","html_url":"https://github.com/icankeep","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":363054123,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNjMwNTQxMjM=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"icankeep/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"icankeep","id":39434627,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDM0NjI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39434627?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep","html_url":"https://github.com/icankeep","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/icankeep/dubbo","description":"Apache

change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

easily: -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-05-22T06:44:23Z","updated_at":"2021-05-23T06:39:28Z","closed_at":"2021-05-23T06:39:28Z","merged_at":"2021-05-23T06:39:27Z","merge_commit_sha":"a9b31b15ef2c084c67a49017c891aec2e6d15dc7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7825/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7825/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7825/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/fa9b23a0e01af3f6646723c2150cb83af9676a67","head":{"label":"icankeep:up-dev-issue#7823","ref":"up-dev-issue#7823","sha":"fa9b23a0e01af3f6646723c2150cb83af9676a67","user":{"login":"icankeep","id":39434627,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDM0NjI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39434627?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep","html_url":"https://github.com/icankeep","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":363054123,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNjMwNTQxMjM=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"icankeep/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"icankeep","id":39434627,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDM0NjI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39434627?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep","html_url":"https://github.com/icankeep","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/icankeep/dubbo","description":"Apache

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-05-21T00:36:42Z","updated_at":"2021-05-22T07:01:16Z","closed_at":"2021-05-22T07:01:16Z","merged_at":"2021-05-22T07:01:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"47bbbbe93902ddbc7a7f131e56b9bfbc872f2dd7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7814/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7814/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7814/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/7bb7d691e9b071132a985405d8d32af67bbdca9a","head":{"label":"icankeep:up-dev-issue#7813","ref":"up-dev-issue#7813","sha":"7bb7d691e9b071132a985405d8d32af67bbdca9a","user":{"login":"icankeep","id":39434627,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDM0NjI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39434627?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep","html_url":"https://github.com/icankeep","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":363054123,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNjMwNTQxMjM=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"icankeep/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"icankeep","id":39434627,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDM0NjI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39434627?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep","html_url":"https://github.com/icankeep","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icankeep/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/icankeep/dubbo","description":"Apache

Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-05-20T06:33:55Z","updated_at":"2021-06-08T16:16:55Z","closed_at":"2021-06-08T16:16:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2c04884a65954c9f5fa8265b33ee7cfea68b1140","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7809/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7809/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7809/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/9a2d1850087d968a8bfe414f8e0141a0359014ce","head":{"label":"hadley0828:add_test_cases_for_metricsConfig","ref":"add_test_cases_for_metricsConfig","sha":"9a2d1850087d968a8bfe414f8e0141a0359014ce","user":{"login":"hadley0828","id":18096538,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk2NTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18096538?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadley0828","html_url":"https://github.com/hadley0828","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadley0828/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadley0828/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadley0828/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadley0828/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadley0828/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadley0828/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadley0828/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadley0828/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadley0828/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":369095013,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNjkwOTUwMTM=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"hadley0828/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hadley0828","id":18096538,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk2NTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18096538?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadley0828","html_url":"https://github.com/hadley0828","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadley0828/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadley0828/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadley0828/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadley0828/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadley0828/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadley0828/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadley0828/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadley0828/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hadley0828/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hadley0828/dubbo","description":"Apache

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-05-20T03:05:02Z","updated_at":"2021-06-08T16:22:34Z","closed_at":"2021-06-08T16:22:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d2f7eb00ff2508346370c8d0bf1f256300e16d37","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7805/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7805/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7805/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/1d55403dbac45600e546a13750e7e4da08df0d3b","head":{"label":"skyguard1:upgrade_curator_version","ref":"upgrade_curator_version","sha":"1d55403dbac45600e546a13750e7e4da08df0d3b","user":{"login":"skyguard1","id":24522024,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTIyMDI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24522024?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1","html_url":"https://github.com/skyguard1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":274626224,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzQ2MjYyMjQ=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"skyguard1/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"skyguard1","id":24522024,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTIyMDI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24522024?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1","html_url":"https://github.com/skyguard1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyguard1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/skyguard1/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.
