using the service support channels\r\n\r\n  * if you tried and have difficulty with diagnosing and fixing the problem yourself, consider creating a [bug

cached parameters in Python Breeze were largely based on\r\nBash implementation. They did the job but required pretty\r\ncumbersome synchronization of cached values with parameters\r\npassed and it was easy to forget about this as you had to\r\ndo it sepearately in each method that had potentially\r\ncacheable parameters.\r\n\r\nIn this PR we take advantage of the Click class hiarchy and their\r\nextendability. We've already extended Click Choice parameter\r\nto be much better formatted for long list of choices but we take\r\nthis a bit further now with adding new type of parameter that\r\ncan cache the values between runs.\r\n\r\nThis has multiple advantages:\r\n\r\n* we do not have to remember about synchroniation - parameters\r\n  automatically read/write their values from cache as they are\r\n  used\r\n* we can automatically set parameters to default when wrong\r\n  value is passed. This is nice as user does not have to\r\n  re-run the command because the values are corrected\r\n  on-the-flight.\r\n* the parameters can have their default values displayed in\r\n  help screen (we use sentinel default that we can use to\r\n  detect if value was passed from parameter or taken from default)\r\n* the parameters can also have their <current> values marked in\r\n  list of choices - so the user in the help screen can see not\r\n  only the default but also which value is currently selected\r\n  and will be used if you do not pass any parameter.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

is another small aftermath after the #23104 - this could not\r\nbe tested during PRs because generate-constraints only run in\r\nmain in apache/airflow repo and a problem crept in that I have\r\nforgotten to add --run-in-parallel for those breeze commands,\r\nwhich resulted in missing the python version to generate\r\nconstraints for.\r\n\r\nThis change adds --run-in-parallell and list of python versions\r\nto work on so that generate constraints might start work again.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

we've separated some CI-only tools like freespace\r\nand find-newer-dependencies as separate scripts (similarly to\r\ninitialize-virtualenv) but contrary to the initialize, our tools\r\ncan and should be run in Breeze's virtualenv.\r\n\r\nHowever we are just in the middle of using breeze commands in\r\nthe CI context, the commands are not \"alien\" any more and\r\nthey seem to fit the same pattern as other commands.\r\n\r\nSince we now have the possibility of grouping sub-commmands in separate\r\nlogical groups, it makes perfect sense to bring the tools to the\r\nbreeze's sub-commands - mostly because of the auto-complete\r\nsupport and familiarity of using breeze commands in CI.\r\n\r\nThis PR brings both freespace and find-newer-dependencies tools\r\nalready used in CI to become breeze sub-commands. It also\r\nadds \"fix-ownership\" command, so that we can run owership\r\nfixing on Linux machines (and adds fixing ownership as\r\nmandatory stop in all breeze-run jobs in CI.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

is an aftermath of #23104 after switchig to docs building\r\nby breeze, failure of build documentation did not trigger failure\r\nof the docs build (but it did trigger main failure of pushing\r\nthe documentation).\r\n\r\nThis change improves and simplifies the return code processing and\r\npropagation in the commands executed by breeze - thanks to common\r\nreturncode, stdout, stderr available in both CompletedProcess\r\nand CalledProcessError and returning fake CompletedProcess in dry_run\r\nmode, we can also satisfy MyPy type check by returning non-optional\r\nUnion of those two types which simplifies returncode processing.\r\n\r\nThis change fixes the error in the docs (lack of empty lines before\r\nauto-generated extras).\r\n\r\nAll commands have been reviewed to see if the returncode is\r\ncorrectly handled where needed.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

for RedshiftCreateClusterOperator\r\n\r\nIt makes sense to add RedshiftCreateClusterOperator. It would allow me to test my Redshift related DAG in a more automated way by only using the Airflow operator/sensor. In the current implementation, `RedshiftCreateClusterOperator` does not wait for the cluster to come to an available state rather it submits create job and returns metadata. If someone wants to wait for a particular cluster state can use `RedshiftClusterSensor` after `RedshiftCreateClusterOperator`.\r\n\r\n- Add an example operator, RedshiftCreateClusterOperator class and unit test \r\n- Add documentation\r\n\r\n@kaxil @phanikumv

PR aims to fix a long-standing logging bug present in Airflow. In particular, any clusters of more than one worker do not handle their logs appropriately - always fetching files from the host used in the last run.\r\n\r\nThis change adds a lookup table for per-try information for TaskInstances. That allows storing a separate hostname for each try of a task. \r\n\r\nQuestions to consider before merging - comments would be appreciated:\r\n - [ ] What kinds of tests should be added?\r\n - [ ] What is the appropriate way to add a database migration to the codebase?\r\n\r\nThis is a redesign of a previous PR #23135.\r\n\r\ncloses:

#23169\r\nPrevent moment from truncating the result of diff to zero decimal places\r\n\r\nAs moment.diff has the default behavior of truncating the decimal places of diff results (i.e. rounding down to the nearest integer), when the duration of a task run is less than a full second moment rounds the duration down to 0. This behavior results in the task duration rendering as empty/null rather than as the correct task run duration.\r\n\r\nMoment's diff function accepts a third, optional boolean argument that dictates its result truncation behavior. By default this value is false which leads to the unwanted behavior described above. Setting this argument to true when calling diff will allow the result to exist as a decimal, fixing the situation where task run duration is rounded down to 0 seconds.","created_at":"2022-04-22T17:02:11Z","updated_at":"2022-07-17T00:12:51Z","closed_at":"2022-07-17T00:12:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bbbe37811e85d98e9aa13d7a65319ae4e0a7c44c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ryanahamilton","id":3267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanahamilton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale PRs per the .github/workflows/stale.yml policy file"},{"id":1545584474,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTg0NDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:webserver","name":"area:webserver","color":"a9db3f","default":false,"description":"Webserver related Issues"},{"id":2514952451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTE0OTUyNDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:UI","name":"area:UI","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"Related to UI/UX.

we added clearing individual mapped tasks, we unfortunately broke\nthe up/down stream feature\n\nThis was because when passing task_id/task_id+map_index down that\nlimited it to _just_ that task_id.\n\nSo we need to change it to also support the up/downstream we need to add\nthose tasks to the list we pass on, meaning that we have to support\ntask_id and (task_id,map_index) tuples in the same `task_id` list.\n\nThis almost certainly needs tests adding!\n<!--\nThank you for contributing!

have the new Python-based breeze and we want to replace all\r\nthe functionality used from the old Breeze with the new one.\r\n\r\nThe most important is image management. It is used in many\r\nplaces and this PR replaces all the places and removes image\r\nbuilidng, pushing, pulling to use the new Breeze everywhere.\r\n\r\nThat includes:\r\n\r\n* Building and pushing CI image on CI\r\n* Building and pushing PROD image on CI which includes:\r\n  * building Airflow packages\r\n  * building Provider packages\r\n  * waiting for images in parallel (both CI and and PROD)\r\n  * veifying the images (both CI and PROD)\r\n\r\nAll those commands have been moved to breeze.py and that required\r\nsome modification in the Breeze parameter handling - mainly related\r\nto adding spaces when help was displayed because long list of\r\npackages looked very bad in help output.\r\n\r\nIt's been easier to implement it in one big PR as using\r\nimage building and pulling was deeply embedded in many scripts.\r\n\r\nWith this change all the scripts in CI use directly breeze\r\nand combine using command line parameters with evn variables\r\ndirectly in the job that execute the breeze commands which\r\nmakes it much easier to understand what is going on and\r\nrepeat it locally using Breeze.\r\n\r\nFixes: #22825\r\nFixes: #23077\r\nFixes: #23076\r\nFixes: #22829\r\nFixes: #22828\r\nFixes: #22826\r\nFixes: #20961\r\nFixes: #23102\r\nFixes: #21098\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

during migration from 1.10.14 to 2.2.3, I noticed an issue in the `BigQueryDeleteTableOperator`. For the context of this, there are two ways to specify a table in GCP BigQuery, one with the project_id, like `my-project.mydataset.mytable`, and the other one without project_id, like `mydataset.mytable`. \r\n\r\nIn 1.10.14, I was using the version without project_id, because the table can be recognized by `BigQueryHook`, using `bigquery_conn_id` to fetch `project_id` in configuration.\r\n\r\nThe path to pass this info is: [gcp_api_base_hook#L131](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/c743b95a02ba1ec04013635a56ad042ce98823d2/airflow/contrib/hooks/gcp_api_base_hook.py#L131) ->  [gcp_api_base_hook#L200](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/c743b95a02ba1ec04013635a56ad042ce98823d2/airflow/contrib/hooks/gcp_api_base_hook.py#L200) -> [bigquery_hook#L71](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/c743b95a02ba1ec04013635a56ad042ce98823d2/airflow/contrib/hooks/bigquery_hook.py#L71) -> [bigquery_hook#L1498](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/c743b95a02ba1ec04013635a56ad042ce98823d2/airflow/contrib/hooks/bigquery_hook.py#L1498).\r\n\r\nBut after upgrading to 2.2.3, a full `table_id` is required. This is unexpected because `bigquery_conn_id/gcp_conn_id` is still a valid parameter, `BigQueryDeleteTableOperator`  should still be able to get `project_id` automatically from the connection configuration. It seems like in this line of code [bigquery#L1195](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/eb26510d3a1ccfaa9e4f8e1e0c91b5c74ae7393e/airflow/providers/google/cloud/hooks/bigquery.py#L1195), it forces users to use full `table_id` to create a `Table` instance, which is the **_root cause_**.\r\n\r\nMethod `delete_table` accepts 4 types of tables, such as `Table`, `TableReference`, `TableListItem` and `str` as shown in [client#L1754](https://github.com/googleapis/python-bigquery/blob/c1d3e3089de1c267f8fb013283289b7d42172c76/google/cloud/bigquery/client.py#L1754). Then in [client#L1784](https://github.com/googleapis/python-bigquery/blob/c1d3e3089de1c267f8fb013283289b7d42172c76/google/cloud/bigquery/client.py#L1784), it converts these 4 types to 1 type, which is `TableReference` as shown in [table#L2689](https://github.com/googleapis/python-bigquery/blob/c1d3e3089de1c267f8fb013283289b7d42172c76/google/cloud/bigquery/table.py#L2689).\r\n\r\nSo back to the possible improvement of this issue, I wonder if it will help migration get smoother if instead of using `Table.from_string` to get a `Table` type, a `str` type parameter is passed directly. And this `str` parameter can be just `mydataset.mytable`, with `project_id` set by the `Client` as shown in [bigquery#L1194](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/8dedd2ac13a6cdc0c363446985f492e0f702f639/airflow/providers/google/cloud/hooks/bigquery.py#L1194). I believe due to the plan of [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/composer-2/composer-versioning-overview#version-support-for-composer-1), companies are slowly migrating to Airflow 2.0 for better support. This improvement will avoid having them add the `project_id`  to `table_id` for hundreds of DAGs since it is already included in the connection configuration.\r\n\r\nBelow are two scenarios based on the two formats of specifying a BigQuery table:\r\n\r\n1. `table_id` like `mydataset.mytable` is passed in [bigquery#L1797](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/8dedd2ac13a6cdc0c363446985f492e0f702f639/airflow/providers/google/cloud/operators/bigquery.py#L1797) and the corresponding `project_id` is configured by the connection. This will work as expected, if no `project_id` is found, error will be captured in [_helpers#L825](https://github.com/googleapis/python-bigquery/blob/c1d3e3089de1c267f8fb013283289b7d42172c76/google/cloud/bigquery/_helpers.py#L825).\r\n2. `table_id` like `my-project.mydataset.mytable` is passed. In this case, whether or not the `project_id` is configured or configured correspondingly, it will use the `project_id` defined in the `table_id` regardless as shown in [_helpers#L836](https://github.com/googleapis/python-bigquery/blob/c1d3e3089de1c267f8fb013283289b7d42172c76/google/cloud/bigquery/_helpers.py#L836).\r\n\r\nThis is my first attempt at submitting a PR to an open-sourced repo. Please let me know how I can improve. It is also fine if it is not worth merging such a change. I enjoyed the time when looking into this.\r\n\r\n@kaxil @eladkal @potiuk

(i.e. a dict) It seems to be a common problem, but its not really a problem with airflow itself, rather \"incomaptible defaults\" of airflow and filebeat. See my comment here: https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/15613#issuecomment-1104487752\r\n\r\nI considered making `_group_logs_by_host` \"smart\" and let it handle \"common\" `host` objects. (Like the ones add_host_metadata or filebeat itself are producing) \r\nBut it struck me as risky in case someone does something else with the `host` field. Making an assumption like taking the `host.hostname` if it is available might have unintended side-effects if a worker node changes hostname / ip / Mac. Turning the entire `host` into a string might also cause issues if the `host` object happens to contain volatile values like \"uptime\" or \"load\". \r\n\r\ncloses:

In particular, any clusters of more than one worker do not handle their logs appropriately - always fetching files from the host used in the last run.\r\n\r\nThis change replaces the `hostname` field of the `TaskInstance` object with a list `hostnames`, storing a separate hostname for each run of the job. \r\n\r\nThis iteration is not final. If you have any comments, do not hesitate to post them.\r\n\r\nIn particular, the areas I am looking for feedback on are:\r\n - [ ] Is the AIP process necessary for this kind of change? If so, how would one ensure it goes smoothly?\r\n - [ ] What kinds of tests should be added?\r\n - [ ] A database migration is needed for this change. What is the appropriate way to implement one?\r\n\r\ncloses: #16472\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

Current \"upgrading provider\" example is misleading. \r\n`apache-airflow-providers-docker==2.1.0` is actually a downgrade now days in `apache/airflow:2.2.5` (which shipped with `apache-airflow-providers-docker==2.5.2` ) - so it's more downgrade than upgrade. \r\nThat's why I renamed it to \"custom\" provider version (as it hard to maintain the version in the example) and I picked a version \"in the middle\" - 2.5.1\r\n* Following the [last comment](https://stackoverflow.com/a/71142395/1011253) in StackOverflow answer I'm adding a common example of Spark usage which combine both python provider package and `apt` package (+ setting mandatory environment variable

this is part of the path to getting k8s hook into KPO, but i've separated it out for easier review.\r\n\r\nCurrently when K8s hook receives no configuration (e.g. incluster vs config file content vs config file path) the default client generation process will try to load the kube config in the default location.  This is inconsistent with airflow core's behavior in kubernetes executor and kubernetes pod operator (in_cluster=True is the default with those).\r\n\r\nTo make k8s hook's behavior consistent, we can first try incluster, then if that fails, try default kubeconfig.  This should be safe to do.  The kubernetes client will check for 2 environment variables that an in-cluster environment should have and if it doesn't find them, it will raise ConfigException (see here: https://github.com/kubernetes-client/python/blob/1271465acdb80bf174c50564a384fd6898635ea6/kubernetes/base/config/incluster_config.py#L60-L62).  If ConfigException is raised, K8s hook will fall back to looking for the default config.\r\n","created_at":"2022-04-20T18:31:00Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T15:35:58Z","closed_at":"2022-04-21T15:35:57Z","merged_at":"2022-04-21T15:35:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"c7399c7190750ba705b8255b7a92de2554e6eef3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1697155831,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjk3MTU1ODMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:providers","name":"area:providers","color":"d4c5f9","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2458345138,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNDU4MzQ1MTM4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/okay%20to%20merge","name":"okay

first glance this looks like a lot of un-related changed, but it is\nall related to handling errors in unmapping:\n\n- Ensure that SimpleTaskInstance (and thus the Zombie callback) knows\n  about map_index, and simplify the code for SimpleTaskInstance -- no\n  need for properties, just attributes works.\n\n- Be able to create a TaskFail from a TI, not a Task.\n\n  This is so that we can create the TaskFail with the mapped task so we\n  can delay unmapping the task in TI.handle_failure as long as possible.\n\n- Change email_alert and get_email_subject_content to take the task so\n  we can pass the unmapped Task around.\n\nFixes #23107\n<!--\nThank you for contributing!

have the new Python-based breeze and we want to replace all\r\nthe functionality used from the old Breeze with the new one.\r\n\r\nThe most important is image management. It is used in many\r\nplaces and this PR replaces all the places and removes image\r\nbuilidng, pushing, pulling to use the new Breeze everywhere.\r\n\r\nThat includes:\r\n\r\n* Building and pushing CI image on CI\r\n* Building and pushing PROD image on CI which includes:\r\n  * building Airflow packages\r\n  * building Provider packages\r\n  * waiting for images in parallel (both CI and and PROD)\r\n  * veifying the images (both CI and PROD)\r\n\r\nAll those commands have been moved to breeze.py and that required\r\nsome modification in the Breeze parameter handling - mainly related\r\nto adding spaces when help was displayed because long list of\r\npackages looked very bad in help output.\r\n\r\nIt's been easier to implement it in one big PR as using\r\nimage building and pulling was deeply embedded in many scripts.\r\n\r\nWith this change all the scripts in CI use directly breeze\r\nand combine using command line parameters with evn variables\r\ndirectly in the job that execute the breeze commands which\r\nmakes it much easier to understand what is going on and\r\nrepeat it locally using Breeze.\r\n\r\nFixes: #22825\r\nFixes: #23077\r\nFixes: #23076\r\nFixes: #22829\r\nFixes: #22828\r\nFixes: #22826\r\nFixes: #20961\r\nFixes: #23102\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

Graph we show a summary of a mapped task. In that summary, we had a link to `/task` with metadata of that task and links to templates, xcom, and logs. Xcom and logs would be blank. Templates would crash. The regular details wouldn't provide any instance data, showing \"No Task Instance Available\". Therefore, it would be better to not show that button at all. If a user wants that information , then they need to zoom into a specific mapped task.

MyPy detects errors which have not been detected\r\nbefore. This is likely caused by having too many files passed\r\nto MyPY. If the number of files to pass to MyPy is too big,\r\npre-commit will automatically split the list of files into\r\nseveral \"mypy\" commands. If we are unlucky the list of files\r\nwill cause MyPy to detect slightly different errors.\r\n\r\nWe split the mypy checks to be run separately for airflow core\r\nand airflow providers to limit the list of files to be shorter.\r\n\r\nWe are also preparing for splitting off providers so this is\r\ngood idea in general.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!
