current TVM system, we categorize the machine's memory into serval types: `global`, `shared`, etc. Based on this, we implicitly allocate and use those memory with the scheduling primitives `cache_read` / `cache_write` . However, caching still requires explicit movement during launch of every kernel, it can be beneficial to allocate these special memory explicitly during runtime so they can be reused across operators. Apart from this, TVM assumes that all the memory objects can be manipulated with a plain pointer (`void*`). The main limitations of the current runtime are:\r\n\r\n- L0: Only support one kind of memory scope(global on-chip DRAM).\r\n- L1: Assumes memory as flat 1D access, cannot support special multi-dimensional layout memory(e.g. OpenCL's texture memory).\r\n\r\nThis PR bings changes in the TVM runtime to support special memory.

the concat type relation assigns output shape Any() to non-concat axes if there is even one `Any` in corresponding input tensor shapes. But it is clear that for non-concat axes, if there is one or more static dim in input tensors, the input static dims and the output dim must all be the same static value.\r\n\r\nFor example, after this PR, the typing for the concat op with concat axis == 0 changes as follows:\r\n\r\n* Current: [(?, 3), (?, ?)] -> (?, ?)\r\n* After this PR: [(?, 3), (?, ?)] -> (?, 3)\r\n\r\nThis, together with https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7479, removes all unnecessary `any_dim` from PyTorch MaskRCNN, and significantly simplifies dynamic injective kernels. Below is an example of super-complicated and slow dynamic injective op, due to too many `any_dim`. This has been the bottleneck in PyTorch MaskRCNN, but after this PR, it becomes reasonable and no longer bottleneck.\r\n\r\n* Before https://gist.github.com/masahi/c412ed75bf596dd627ce93a9cb578901\r\n* After https://gist.github.com/masahi/d3db22563b3864baf7e7813ed7c6e0e1\r\n\r\nThanks to this optimization, PyTorch MaskRCNN runs **30 milli seconds** (!!) faster now.\r\n\r\nplease review @kevinthesun @anijain2305 @mbrookhart @jwfromm

* If a Node subclass raises an exception and ctypes is in use before\r\n   __init_handle_by_constructor__ is called (or self.handle is\r\n   otherwise set), a Python stack overflow could result. This is\r\n   because the unset handle slot causes self.handle accesses to\r\n   fallback on the getattr(self, 'handle') method, invoking\r\n   NodeGetAttr.\r\n * Then I believe this causes an infinite loop.\r\n * The fix is to make Node.__getattr__ raise AttributeError for all\r\n   attributes in __slots__, then make __del__ tolerant to missing\r\n   self.handle.\r\n * I don't believe cython is affected because it implements a\r\n   descriptor to access its underlying chandle and that shouldn't be

object detection models have many uses of slicing like `arr[:, None]` which is essentially nop, see for example https://github.com/pytorch/vision/blob/f7fae490980885e426fef01bb214025b9eddb832/torchvision/models/detection/roi_heads.py#L80\r\n\r\nThe current `aten::slice` converter does not detect such nop slicing and inserts unnecessary `strided_slice`. The worst of all, many of  `arr[:, None]` converts to dynamic strided slice, which results in too much `any_dim`.\r\n\r\nI simplified `aten::slice` conversion and fixed the fast path detection. I've updated MaskRCNN rewrite pattern to remove one of `dyn.strided_slice`, which serves as a test case.\r\n\r\nplease review @kevinthesun @anijain2305 @siju-samuel

thrust offload is done in a rather ad hoc way, unlike other libs such as cudnn which requires using `-libs=cudnn` in addition to `-DUSE_CUDNN=ON`. \r\n\r\nThis PR enforces a requirement `-libs=thrust` to enable thrust offload, to make it consistent with other libs. It also makes it easier to compare performance of thrust and TIR sort. @mbrookhart is working on a new TIR sort implementation, based on [mergepath](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2628.pdf), that is competitive or even faster than thrust, so hopefully we don't have to depend on thrust in the near future.\r\n\r\nNOTE: If you want to use thrust, you must update your code to add `-libs=thrust` after this PR.\r\n\r\n@tkonolige @mbrookhart @csullivan @jwfromm @zhiics @kevinthesun @anijain2305 @trevor-m @Laurawly

been working on optimizing MaskRCNN/FasterRCNN, one I thing I found was that Ansor generates better code for NHWC layout (see https://discuss.tvm.apache.org/t/autoscheduler-why-no-winograd-for-nchw-layout/9139). So I'm looking at improving NHWC end to end support / performance.\r\n\r\n`roi_align` only supports NCHW layout, so `layout_transform` is inserted before/after each `roi_align`. This layout transform turned out expensive on GPU, so I added NHWC impl to `roi_align` to remove `layout_transform`. This cuts Faster RCNN runtime by 8 milli second.\r\n\r\nNow, with Ansor NHWC tuning + `roi_align` improvement in this PR, we are beating pytorch by a large margin:\r\n```\r\nTVM NHWC(Ansor) + cublas: 0.0589 milli sec\r\nPyTorch: 0.0738 milli sec\r\n```\r\n\r\nplease review @kevinthesun @anijain2305 @comaniac @jwfromm @mbrookhart @electriclilies

PR adds two test cases that previously caused match exhaustion to crash due to a bad decision in implementing `CartesianProduct`. These cases happen when an empty tuple or constructor with no fields (e.g., `Nil()`) needs to be expanded -- the Cartesian product used for wildcard expansion assumed that it would have at least one field to expand. This was silly of me, since there is exactly one expansion of zero fields: `{â}`.\r\n\r\nI added a base case to `CartesianProduct` and regression tests.\r\n\r\nPlease review @MarisaKirisame @jroesch.

fuzzing.)","created_at":"2021-02-16T06:14:54Z","updated_at":"2021-02-17T06:24:56Z","closed_at":"2021-02-17T06:24:56Z","merged_at":"2021-02-17T06:24:56Z","merge_commit_sha":"77d2fe8a7f239b3a748319f2b14facd2c3b3dccf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/7459/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/7459/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7459/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/58956d9bd57f5eeb5c35d5db873a4222dd90dad5","head":{"label":"slyubomirsky:nested-tuple-pattern","ref":"nested-tuple-pattern","sha":"58956d9bd57f5eeb5c35d5db873a4222dd90dad5","user":{"login":"slyubomirsky","id":5624871,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MjQ4NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5624871?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky","html_url":"https://github.com/slyubomirsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":149190623,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDkxOTA2MjM=","name":"tvm","full_name":"slyubomirsky/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"slyubomirsky","id":5624871,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MjQ4NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5624871?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky","html_url":"https://github.com/slyubomirsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slyubomirsky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/slyubomirsky/tvm","description":"Open

hit the error below when running TIR sort/scan on Vulkan backend:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/1831c17998b29f3797f364410980809bfef554ca/src/runtime/pack_args.h#L186 \r\n\r\nThis is because unlike most other kernels, TIR sort/scan needs to pass an integer scalar from host to GPU, to realize multipass kernel launches:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/1e0d3569b94f650243f4d0ac204d196e3be8b0aa/python/tvm/topi/cuda/sort.py#L203-L206\r\n\r\nCurrently, `width` argument, which is int64 scalar, is passed to GPU backend runtime. But VK/Metal runtime use the calling convention that is different from the one used in CUDA/OpenCL (search for `PackFuncNonBufferArg`) and VK/Metal runtime don't support passing 64 bit scalar, see:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/1831c17998b29f3797f364410980809bfef554ca/src/runtime/pack_args.h#L41-L49\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/1831c17998b29f3797f364410980809bfef554ca/src/runtime/vulkan/vulkan.cc#L1047\r\n\r\nThe fix to this problem is simply to pass int32 scalar instead, and does cast to int64 inside GPU kernel. This enabled TIR scan tests to pass on Vulkan. It also fixed the runtime error that happened while running TIR sort, but the sort result is still not correct on Vulkan. I suspect there is an issue in our SPIR-V codegen.

VM, `BindParamsByName` is run inside `VMCompiler::Lower(...)` before `OptimizeModule` gets called. So when we try to dump the optimized module like this:\r\n```\r\ncompiler = relay.vm.VMCompiler()\r\nopt_mod, _ = compiler.optimize(mod, target, params=params)\r\nprint(opt_mod)\r\n``` \r\nparam binding doesn't happen, so the \"optimized graph\" has parameters as arguments. This means constant folding involving parameters cannot happen, so the optimized graph looks very different (e.g. there are many `layout_transform`) from the output of `relay.optimize`, which does param binding when `relay.optimize` is called.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/384714b58ed374cb1e385142b5dc4128041c945c/src/relay/backend/build_module.cc#L255-L263\r\n\r\nThis PR moves param binding in VM to `OptimizeModule`, to be consistent with the graph codegen.

change enables JUnitXML output from pytest for all TVM python testing. The goal is to enable us to better understand which TVM tests are slow, how a change might impact them, and the runtime variance we see in the TVM CI.\r\n\r\nSee the example test report produced from the [staging run](https://ci.tlcpack.ai/job/tvm/job/ci-docker-staging/59/testReport/) on this PR.\r\n\r\nNote that a [previous staging run](https://ci.tlcpack.ai/job/tvm/job/ci-docker-staging/58/) did timeout in the frontend tests, but by a long shot, so I think there's a chance it was unrelated to this PR.\r\n\r\n## For discussion\r\n\r\n- The JUnit plugin supports [longitudinal test time tracking](https://ci.tlcpack.ai/job/tvm/job/ci-docker-staging/59/testReport/tests.python.relay/test_op_level2/Unit_Test___python3__i386___test_conv2d_winograd/history/) (click the right arrow `>` button on the graph) at both the test level and at the [test group](https://ci.tlcpack.ai/job/tvm/job/ci-docker-staging/59/testReport/tests.python.relay/history/) level.\r\n- Right now, some tests are represented twice: once for cython and once for ctypes. Because these don't appear in the test class path, test time at the group level can lump in both. `pytest` can be configured to add a prefix per-run, so we could fix this easily right now. On the other hand, adding the prefix could clutter the test output and make it harder to scan.\r\n- Do you prefer to prefix the test case names e.g. `cython-tests.python.unittest.test_arith_canonical_simplify.test_split_index_simplify`?\r\n\r\n@tqchen @junrushao1994 @tkonolige @jroesch @zhiics @comaniac @u99127 @manupa-arm @leandron

the following simple change be reviewed please?\r\n\r\nCurrently there isn't any statistics about the used resources by a model\r\nruntime built with Zephyr, making it difficult to have any idea about, for\r\ninstance, the amount of memory taken by the operations necessary to run the\r\nmodel.\r\n\r\nSince Zephyr's SDK already exposes the statistics about various memory\r\nregions on linking by passing '--print-memory-usage' to the linker, it's\r\npossible to use it to have an idea about the amount of memory used by the\r\nmodel and how much memory is left on the device.\r\n\r\nThat commit adds a simple method to extract the memory region information\r\nout of the build output and then uses it to show memory usage statistics\r\nfor various memory regions when Zephyr finishes building the image to be\r\nflashed to the target device.\r\n\r\nOutput example follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngromero@gromero0:~/git/tvm/tutorials/micro$ python3 ./micro_tflite.py \r\nFile

previous implementation of reshape in the Keras frontend attempted to map the target shape, which is specified in NHWC format, to NCHW format. However, this approach had many limitations of what reshapes can be supported and introduced some complicated logic.\r\n\r\nInstead, I am proposing to just transpose input to NHWC, apply the unmodified reshape, then transpose back to NCHW. This is simpler and can support more reshapes which are valid in keras.\r\n\r\nI added some test cases for reshapes which were not supported in the previous implementation, but are now possible.","created_at":"2021-02-11T20:07:47Z","updated_at":"2021-02-12T20:35:18Z","closed_at":"2021-02-12T20:35:17Z","merged_at":"2021-02-12T20:35:17Z","merge_commit_sha":"a1260cc19342c4db61c6942a11c2b2b2b58f8bad","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/7446/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/7446/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7446/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/5d3ae19f511689dd11278bb13553ed073c9c43ff","head":{"label":"trevor-m:keras-reshape","ref":"keras-reshape","sha":"5d3ae19f511689dd11278bb13553ed073c9c43ff","user":{"login":"trevor-m","id":12981474,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTgxNDc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12981474?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m","html_url":"https://github.com/trevor-m","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":204561313,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDQ1NjEzMTM=","name":"tvm","full_name":"trevor-m/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"trevor-m","id":12981474,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTgxNDc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12981474?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m","html_url":"https://github.com/trevor-m","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevor-m/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/trevor-m/tvm","description":"Open

been hitting a lot of issues in more complicated ONNX models where results of something like dynamic strided slice feed into an op like dynamic reshape, causing dynamic ranks to appear and crash the importer. To fix this, I decided it might be good to try to progagate constant information through the importer during import instead of trying to retroactively remove dynamic ops in a pass. To do that, I changed the freeze_params behavior of the importer to create constants before import, and made the importer fold constants through the importer as they are seen. Additionally, I edited the ops to only construct dynamic ops if the inputs are not constant.\r\n\r\nIn sum, this ends up creating many fewer dynamic ops in the ONNX importer, and so we see many fewer

is an implementation of TIR While node as discussed in RFC https://discuss.tvm.apache.org/t/rfc-add-while-loop-node-to-tir/9028. It supercedes my earlier attempt in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7385.\r\n\r\nThe PR consists of\r\n* IR node definition + boilerplate\r\n* Minimal changes to TIR transform passes (so far only modifies `storage_rewrite.cc`, everything else uses the default visitor)\r\n* LLVM and C source codegen\r\n* Various test cases\r\n* Update CUDA NMS to use while loop\r\n\r\nHybrid script support etc are left for future work.\r\n\r\nNow we can write binary search succinctly as follows:\r\n```\r\nlo[0] = 0\r\nhi[0] = n\r\nv = B[i]\r\n\r\nwith ib.while_loop(lo[0] < hi[0]):\r\n    mid = lo[0] + (hi[0] - lo[0] >> 1)\r\n    with ib.if_scope(A[mid] < v):\r\n        lo[0] = mid + 1\r\n    with ib.else_scope():\r\n        hi[0] = mid\r\n\r\nC[i] = lo[0]\r\n```\r\nAs another nice use of while loop, I added a test that draws a useless mandelbrot set :slightly_smiling_face:

patch adds a support for calling TorchScript. This can be used fallback for when torch operators are not yet implemented or if one wants to incorporate bespoke PyTorch custom ops into TVM with ease.\r\n\r\nIt adds\r\n- a new relay `torchop` that takes a variable number of inputs and executes a provided TorchScript (aka PyTorch JIT) function,\r\n- a backend module class that calls into LibTorch (aka the C++ bindings underlying PyTorch), executing a TorchScript function.\r\n\r\nThe key addition to the relay infrastructure is that while leaving `num_inputs == -1` on operator registration is documented to indicate a variable number of inputs, the type inference pass is not prepared to deal with it and instead requires the number of arguments provided to match the number of arguments with `add_argument` on operator registration. The proposed change to the type inference is then to match the declared arguments but to allow additional arguments if `num_inputs` is `-1`.\r\n\r\nThe other detail is that it uses a string attribute in the call node's attributes to take the serialized TorchScript. This is a bit fishy as the serialized representation is binary. I used serialization to get TorchScript into TVM at the C++ level as it is tricky to interoperate between PyBind-wrapped objects (TorchScript in PyTorch) and the TVM FFI, but we might pass things around as handles later (but I'm not sure if that works well with attributes). I would be glad to have your advice on this.\r\n\r\nCurrently I only support one output tensor and FP32, but that is straightforward to make flexible, and I would do this in parallel to the more fundamental discussion e.g. around the things above.\r\n\r\nEven though this is in draft state, I'm opening this PR to make discussions concrete in terms of code.\r\n\r\nI also posted a discussion [to
