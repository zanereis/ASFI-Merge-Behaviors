What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR change the work of getting glob path in parallel, which can make complex wildcard path more quickly, the mainly changes in details:\r\n1.Add new function getGlobbedPaths in DataSource, return all paths represented by the wildcard pattern, use a local thread pool to do this while the paths number expanded from patten lager than `spark.sql.sources.parallelGetGlobbedPath.threshold`. The local thread pool size controlled by `spark.sql.sources.parallelGetGlobbedPath.numThreads`\r\n2.Add new function expandGlobPath in SparkHadoopUtil, to expand the dir represented by the patten, here we mainly reuse the logic in org.apache.hadoop.fs.Globber.glob().\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdd UT in SparkHadoopUtilSuite.\r\n","created_at":"2018-06-23T05:33:14Z","updated_at":"2020-01-11T00:06:17Z","closed_at":"2020-01-11T00:06:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"aa0f8b044c9fccb197f12c614a5b376dd9d3e506","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21618/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21618/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21618/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/95726e9e26f16f41a69db16450469559540e5ddf","head":{"label":"xuanyuanking:SPARK-20408","ref":"SPARK-20408","sha":"95726e9e26f16f41a69db16450469559540e5ddf","user":{"login":"xuanyuanking","id":4833765,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MzM3NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4833765?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking","html_url":"https://github.com/xuanyuanking","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52511431,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MjUxMTQzMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"xuanyuanking/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xuanyuanking","id":4833765,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MzM3NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4833765?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking","html_url":"https://github.com/xuanyuanking","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xuanyuanking/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe `WholeTextFileInputFormat` determines the `maxSplitSize` for the file/s being read using the `wholeTextFiles` method. While this works well for large files, for smaller files where the maxSplitSize is smaller than the defaults being used with configs like hive-site.xml or explicitly passed in the form of `mapreduce.input.fileinputformat.split.minsize.per.node` or `mapreduce.input.fileinputformat.split.minsize.per.rack` , it just throws up an exception.\r\n\r\n\r\n```java\r\njava.io.IOException:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn PR, I propose new behavior of `size(null)` under the config flag `spark.sql.legacy.sizeOfNull`. If the former one is disabled, the `size()` function returns `null` for `null` input. By default the `spark.sql.legacy.sizeOfNull` is enabled to keep backward compatibility with previous versions. In that case, `size(null)` returns `-1`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nModified existing tests for the `size()` function to check new behavior (`null`) and old one (`-1`).\r\n","created_at":"2018-06-20T11:43:38Z","updated_at":"2019-08-17T13:34:52Z","closed_at":"2018-06-27T02:41:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"690edc745c5fd0a7f9d98acaf9222056f15d3cf9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21598/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21598/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21598/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ae2c7f1e5748cf9e2563bf3d8bdbf01f1f4fd707","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:legacy-size-of-null","ref":"legacy-size-of-null","sha":"ae2c7f1e5748cf9e2563bf3d8bdbf01f1f4fd707","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

all,\r\n\r\nJackson is incompatible with upstream versions, therefore bump the Jackson version to a more recent one. I bumped into some issues with Azure CosmosDB that is using a more recent version of Jackson. This can be fixed by adding exclusions and then it works without any issues. So no breaking changes in the API's.\r\n\r\nI would also consider bumping the version of Jackson in Spark. I would suggest to keep up to date with the dependencies, since in the future this issue will pop up more frequently.\r\n\r\nJira:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n1. Add parameter 'cascade' in CacheManager.uncacheQuery(). Under 'cascade=false' mode, only invalidate the current cache, and for other dependent caches, rebuild execution plan and reuse cached buffer.\r\n2. Pass true/false from callers in different uncache scenarios:\r\n- Drop tables and regular (persistent) views: regular mode\r\n- Drop temporary views: non-cascading mode\r\n- Modify table contents (INSERT/UPDATE/MERGE/DELETE): regular mode\r\n- Call `DataSet.unpersist()`: non-cascading mode\r\n- Call `Catalog.uncacheTable()`: follow the same convention as drop tables/view, which is, use non-cascading mode for temporary views and regular mode for the rest\r\n\r\nNote that a regular (persistent) view is a database object just like a table, so after dropping a regular view (whether cached or not cached), any query referring to that view should no long be valid. Hence if a cached persistent view is dropped, we need to invalidate the all dependent caches so that exceptions will be thrown for any later reference. On the other hand, a temporary view is in fact equivalent to an unnamed DataSet, and dropping a temporary view should have no impact on queries referencing that view. Thus we should do non-cascading uncaching for temporary views, which also guarantees a consistent uncaching behavior between temporary views and unnamed DataSets.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew tests in CachedTableSuite and DatasetCacheSuite.\r\n","created_at":"2018-06-19T22:27:48Z","updated_at":"2018-06-25T14:22:28Z","closed_at":"2018-06-25T14:22:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2265339894b8c0c2d665b91120f2bca01d582659","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21594/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21594/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21594/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/bfda8c1a14da2f7329a70ee235201edf69ba4c52","head":{"label":"maryannxue:noncascading-cache","ref":"noncascading-cache","sha":"bfda8c1a14da2f7329a70ee235201edf69ba4c52","user":{"login":"maryannxue","id":4171904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNzE5MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4171904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue","html_url":"https://github.com/maryannxue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":104110775,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDQxMTA3NzU=","name":"spark","full_name":"maryannxue/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"maryannxue","id":4171904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNzE5MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4171904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue","html_url":"https://github.com/maryannxue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/maryannxue/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR tries to fix the performance regression introduced by SPARK-21517. \r\n\r\nIn our production job, we performed many parallel computations, with high possibility, some task could be scheduled to a host-2 where it needs to read the cache block data from host-1. Often, this big transfer makes the cluster suffer time out issue (it will retry 3 times, each with 120s timeout, and then do recompute to put the cache block into the local MemoryStore).\r\n\r\nThe root cause is that we don't do `consolidateIfNeeded` anymore as we are using \r\n```\r\nUnpooled.wrappedBuffer(chunks.length, getChunks(): _*)\r\n```\r\nin ChunkedByteBuffer. If we have many small chunks, it could cause the `buf.notBuffer(...)` have very bad performance in the case that we have to call `copyByteBuf(...)` many times.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting unit tests and also test in production

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nHere is the description in the JIRA -\r\n\r\nCurrently, our JDBC connector provides the option `dbtable` for users to specify the to-be-loaded JDBC source table. \r\n\r\n ```SQL\r\n val jdbcDf = spark.read\r\n   .format(\"jdbc\")\r\n   .option(\"dbtable\", \"dbName.tableName\")\r\n   .options(jdbcCredentials: Map)\r\n   .load()\r\n ```\r\n\r\nNormally, users do not fetch the whole JDBC table due to the poor performance/throughput of JDBC. Thus, they normally just fetch a small set of tables. For advanced users, they can pass a subquery as the option.   \r\n\r\n ```SQL\r\n val query = \"\"\" (select * from tableName limit 10) as tmp \"\"\"\r\n val jdbcDf = spark.read\r\n   .format(\"jdbc\")\r\n   .option(\"dbtable\", query)\r\n   .options(jdbcCredentials: Map)\r\n   .load()\r\n ```\r\nHowever, this is straightforward to end users. We should simply allow users to specify the query by a new option `query`. We will handle the complexity for them. \r\n\r\n ```SQL\r\n val query = \"\"\"select * from tableName limit 10\"\"\"\r\n val jdbcDf = spark.read\r\n   .format(\"jdbc\")\r\n   .option(\"query\", query)\r\n   .options(jdbcCredentials: Map)\r\n   .load()\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded tests in JDBCSuite and JDBCWriterSuite.\r\nAlso tested against MySQL, Postgress, Oracle, DB2 (using docker infrastructure) to make sure there are no syntax issues.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-06-19T07:10:33Z","updated_at":"2018-06-27T01:05:51Z","closed_at":"2018-06-26T22:22:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"383fd42d9bb9bd7a8f93c33fdc45b372b3806e27","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21590/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21590/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21590/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c083e13289b302efbbe6bc6c915a3b47268a63fc","head":{"label":"dilipbiswal:SPARK-24423","ref":"SPARK-24423","sha":"c083e13289b302efbbe6bc6c915a3b47268a63fc","user":{"login":"dilipbiswal","id":14225158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjI1MTU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14225158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal","html_url":"https://github.com/dilipbiswal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42921897,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjkyMTg5Nw==","name":"spark","full_name":"dilipbiswal/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dilipbiswal","id":14225158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjI1MTU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14225158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal","html_url":"https://github.com/dilipbiswal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dilipbiswal/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the PR, I propose to extend `SparkContext` by:\r\n\r\n1. `def numCores: Int` returns total number of CPU cores of all executors registered in the cluster at the moment. Main use case for that is using it in _repartition()_ and _coalesce()_.\r\n\r\n2. `def numExecutors: Int` returns total number of executors registered in the cluster at the moment. Some jobs, e.g., local node ML training, use a lot of parallelism. It's a common practice to aim to distribute such jobs such that there is one partition for each executor. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded tests for PySpark, `SparkR` and `JavaSparkContext` that check number of cores and executors in `local` mode.\r\n","created_at":"2018-06-19T02:54:46Z","updated_at":"2019-08-17T13:35:01Z","closed_at":"2018-07-24T13:09:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"96c50328c4dbd9f646a2d7e9c530c9a5df6e75d3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21589/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21589/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21589/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/eebb31099f078cc05bf0f6d6e32c94d4ee818f9e","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:num-cores-and-executors","ref":"num-cores-and-executors","sha":"eebb31099f078cc05bf0f6d6e32c94d4ee818f9e","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR targets to make Jenkins tests passed with Hadoop 3 profile.\r\n\r\nIt contains several changes below:\r\n\r\n1. Fix the isolated class loader to share `org.apache.commons.configuration2.*` because it looks failed during class resolution. It's currently only from Hadoop 3.\r\n\r\n2. Fix Jackson dependency, `com.fasterxml.jackson.jaxrs:jackson-jaxrs-json-provider` from Hadoop 3 brings some other Jacksons 2.7.8. SBT resolves this differently so both places are fixed.\r\n\r\n3. Skip conditionally few tests requiring the lower versions of Hive 2.3 when Hadoop 3 is provided. Hive 2.3+ supports Hadoop 3. See HIVE-16081\r\n\r\n4. Skip few specific tests affected by a JDK bug - non-ascii compatible characters in the path in few specific cases. Seems Jenkins instances have the affected JDK version. See comments in the codes.\r\n\r\nI believe each is minor and small for each PR and one PR should be fairly easy to be reviewed as one targeted goal. The changes proposed here are as mininised and isolated as possible as I could.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI manually redistributed `org.spark-project.hive` having the fix for Hadoop 3 under my personal domain `com.github.hyukjinkwon` to test this. Also, I updated Jenkins's testing profile to force to test it against Hadoop 3.\r\n\r\nThe tests are passed in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/21588#issuecomment-398732416 and I reverted the change above back.\r\n","created_at":"2018-06-19T02:38:20Z","updated_at":"2020-03-03T01:20:56Z","closed_at":"2019-04-01T01:11:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f1ad7ddbf152cdacdf6f425d3428297ad34b16c1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21588/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21588/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21588/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a011e50e57537589b23099b4c7b6e2e893c86f9e","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-24590","ref":"SPARK-24590","sha":"a011e50e57537589b23099b4c7b6e2e893c86f9e","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/19080 we simplified the distribution/partitioning framework, and make all the join-like operators

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen turning a Dataset to another Dataset, Spark will up cast the fields in the original Dataset to the type of corresponding fields in the target DataSet.\r\n\r\nHowever, the current upcast behavior is a little weird, we don't allow up casting from string to numeric, but allow non-numeric types as the target, like boolean, date, etc.\r\n\r\nAs a result, `Seq(\"str\").toDS.as[Int]` fails, but `Seq(\"str\").toDS.as[Boolean]` works and throw NPE during execution.\r\n\r\nThe motivation of the up cast is to prevent things like runtime NPE, it's more reasonable to make up cast stricter.\r\n\r\nThis PR does 2 things:\r\n1. rename `Cast.canSafeCast` to `Cast.canUpcast`, and support complex typres\r\n2. remove `Cast.mayTruncate` and replace it with `!Cast.canUpcast`\r\n\r\nNote that, the up cast change also affects persistent view resolution. But since we don't support changing column types of an existing table, there is no behavior change here.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nnew

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis issue aims to upgrade Apache ORC library from 1.4.4 to 1.5.2 in order to bring the following benefits into Apache Spark.\r\n\r\n- [ORC-91](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ORC-91) Support for variable length blocks in HDFS (The current space wasted in ORC to padding is known to be 5%.)\r\n- [ORC-344](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ORC-344) Support for using Decimal64ColumnVector\r\n\r\nIn addition to that, Apache Hive 3.1 and 3.2 will use ORC 1.5.1 ([HIVE-19669](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-19465)) and 1.5.2 ([HIVE-19792](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-19792)) respectively. This will improve the compatibility between Apache Spark and Apache Hive by sharing the common library.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the Jenkins with all existing

attempts.\r\n\r\nThe change adds more information to the stage state tracked by the coordinator,\r\nso that only one task is allowed to commit the output in the above case.\r\nThe stage state in the coordinator is also maintained across stage retries,\r\nso that a stray speculative task from a previous stage attempt is not allowed\r\nto commit.\r\n\r\nThis also removes some code added in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThere is a performance regression in Spark 2.3. When we read a big compressed text file which is un-splittable(e.g. gz), and then take the first record, Spark will scan all the data in the text file which is very slow. For example, `spark.read.text(\"/tmp/test.csv.gz\").head(1)`, we can check out the SQL UI and see that the file is fully scanned.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3182036/41445252-264b1e5a-6ffd-11e8-9a67-4c31d129a314.png)\r\n\r\nThis is introduced by #18955 , which adds a LocalLimit to the query when executing `Dataset.head`. The foundamental problem is, `Limit` is not well whole-stage-codegened. It keeps consuming the input even if we have already hit the limitation.\r\n\r\nHowever, if we just fix LIMIT whole-stage-codegen, the memory leak test will fail, as we don't fully consume the inputs to trigger the resource cleanup.\r\n\r\nTo fix it completely, we should do the following\r\n1. fix LIMIT whole-stage-codegen, stop consuming inputs after hitting the limitation.\r\n2. in whole-stage-codegen, provide a way to release resource of the parant operator, and apply it in LIMIT\r\n3. automatically release resource when task ends.\r\n\r\nHowere this is a non-trivial change, and is risky to backport to Spark 2.3.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to revert #18955 in Spark 2.3. The memory leak is not a big issue. When task ends, Spark will release all the pages allocated by this task, which is kind of releasing most of the resources.\r\n\r\nI'll submit a exhaustive fix to master later.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, the micro-batches in the MicroBatchExecution is not exposed to the user through any public API. This was because we did not want to expose the micro-batches, so that all the APIs we expose, we can eventually support them in the Continuous engine. But now that we have better sense of buiding a ContinuousExecution, I am considering adding APIs which will run only the MicroBatchExecution. I have quite a few use cases where exposing the microbatch output as a dataframe is useful. \r\n- Pass the output rows of each batch to a library that is designed only the batch jobs (example, uses many ML libraries need to collect() while learning).\r\n- Reuse batch data sources for output whose streaming version does not exists (e.g. redshift data source).\r\n- Writer the output rows to multiple places by writing twice for each batch. This is not the most elegant thing to do for multiple-output streaming queries but is likely to be better than running two streaming queries processing the same data twice.\r\n\r\nThe proposal is to add a method `foreachBatch(f: Dataset[T] => Unit)` to Scala/Java/Python `DataStreamWriter`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nNew unit tests.\r\n","created_at":"2018-06-14T23:06:04Z","updated_at":"2020-02-12T11:33:13Z","closed_at":"2018-06-19T21:01:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4ca0225494d3befacf36da5835f0a3679f65739e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21571/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21571/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21571/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5b4252a8a7c40886bb73201327fff22dc921c3dc","head":{"label":"tdas:foreachBatch","ref":"foreachBatch","sha":"5b4252a8a7c40886bb73201327fff22dc921c3dc","user":{"login":"tdas","id":663212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17603343,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzYwMzM0Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"tdas/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tdas","id":663212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tdas/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nProvide a continuous processing implementation of coalesce(1), as well as allowing aggregates on top of it.\r\n\r\nThe changes in ContinuousQueuedDataReader and such are to use split.index (the ID of the partition within the RDD currently being compute()d) rather than context.partitionId() (the partition ID of the scheduled task within the Spark job - that is, the post coalesce writer). In the absence of a narrow dependency, these values were previously always the same, so there was no need to distinguish.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nnew unit

Currently, MemorySink and MemorySinkV2 have unbounded size, meaning that if they're used on big data, they can OOM the stream.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-24547\r\n\r\nTL;DR from JIRA issue:\r\n\r\n- First time I generated images for 2.4.0 Docker was using it's cache, so actually when running jobs, old jars where still in the Docker image. This produces errors like this in the executors:\r\n\r\n`java.io.InvalidClassException: org.apache.spark.storage.BlockManagerId; local class incompatible: stream classdesc serialVersionUID = 6155820641931972169, local class serialVersionUID = -3720498261147521051`\r\n\r\n- The second problem was that the spark container is pushed, but the spark-py container wasn't yet. This was just forgotten in the initial PR.\r\n\r\n- A third problem I also ran into because I had an older docker was https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/21551 so I have not included a fix for that in this ticket.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI've tested it on my own Spark on k8s deployment.\r\n","created_at":"2018-06-13T11:34:35Z","updated_at":"2018-06-21T00:14:12Z","closed_at":"2018-06-21T00:14:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"917652ec762f3b505cdeb205a07301a505e88fc8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21555/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21555/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21555/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c17179b494011fb7d0116841f66fec74e82c0a89","head":{"label":"rayburgemeestre:SPARK-24547","ref":"SPARK-24547","sha":"c17179b494011fb7d0116841f66fec74e82c0a89","user":{"login":"rayburgemeestre","id":498257,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5ODI1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/498257?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayburgemeestre","html_url":"https://github.com/rayburgemeestre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayburgemeestre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayburgemeestre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayburgemeestre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayburgemeestre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayburgemeestre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayburgemeestre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayburgemeestre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayburgemeestre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayburgemeestre/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":137204222,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzcyMDQyMjI=","name":"spark","full_name":"rayburgemeestre/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rayburgemeestre","id":498257,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5ODI1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/498257?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayburgemeestre","html_url":"https://github.com/rayburgemeestre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayburgemeestre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayburgemeestre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayburgemeestre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayburgemeestre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayburgemeestre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayburgemeestre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayburgemeestre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayburgemeestre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayburgemeestre/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rayburgemeestre/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn our distribution,  because we don't do such fine-grained access control of config file, also configuration file is world readable shared between different components, so password may leak to different users.\r\n\r\nHadoop credential provider API support storing password in a secure way, in which Spark could read it in a secure way, so here propose to add support of using credential provider API to get password.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdding tests and verified

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis changes the calls of `toPandas()` and `createDataFrame()` to use the Arrow stream format, when Arrow is enabled.  Previously, Arrow data was written to byte arrays where each chunk is an output of the Arrow file format.  This was mainly due to constraints at the time, and caused some overhead by writing the schema/footer on each chunk of data and then having to read multiple Arrow file inputs and concat them together.\r\n\r\nUsing the Arrow stream format has improved these by increasing performance, lower memory overhead for the average case, and simplified the code.  Here are the details of this change:\r\n\r\n**toPandas()**\r\n\r\n_Before:_\r\nSpark internal rows are converted to Arrow file format, each group of records is a complete Arrow file which contains the schema and other metadata.  Next a collect is done and an Array of Arrow files is the result.  After that each Arrow file is sent to Python driver which then loads each file and concats them to a single Arrow DataFrame.\r\n\r\n_After:_\r\nSpark internal rows are converted to ArrowRecordBatches directly, which is the simplest Arrow component for IPC data transfers.  The driver JVM then immediately starts serving data to Python as an Arrow stream, sending the schema first. It then starts a Spark job with a custom handler that sends Arrow RecordBatches to Python. Partitions arriving in order are sent immediately, and out-of-order partitions are buffered until the ones that precede it come in. This improves performance, simplifies memory usage on executors, and improves the average memory usage on the JVM driver.  Since the order of partitions must be preserved, the worst case is that the first partition will be the last to arrive all data must be buffered in memory until then. This case is no worse that before when doing a full collect.\r\n\r\n**createDataFrame()**\r\n\r\n_Before:_\r\nA Pandas DataFrame is split into parts and each part is made into an Arrow file.  Then each file is prefixed by the buffer size and written to a temp file.  The temp file is read and each Arrow file is parallelized as a byte array.\r\n\r\n_After:_\r\nA Pandas DataFrame is split into parts, then an Arrow stream is written to a temp file where each part is an ArrowRecordBatch.  The temp file is read as a stream and the Arrow messages are examined.  If the message is an ArrowRecordBatch, the data is saved as a byte array.  After reading the file, each ArrowRecordBatch is parallelized as a byte array.  This has slightly more processing than before because we must look each Arrow message to extract the record batches, but performance ends up a litle better.  It is cleaner in the sense that IPC from Python to JVM is done over a single Arrow stream.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded new unit tests for the additions to ArrowConverters in Scala, existing tests for Python.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Performance Tests - toPandas\r\n\r\nTests run on a 4 node standalone cluster with 32 cores total, 14.04.1-Ubuntu and OpenJDK 8\r\nmeasured wall clock time to execute `toPandas()` and took the average best time of 5 runs/5 loops each.\r\n\r\nTest code\r\n```python\r\ndf = spark.range(1 << 25, numPartitions=32).toDF(\"id\").withColumn(\"x1\", rand()).withColumn(\"x2\", rand()).withColumn(\"x3\", rand()).withColumn(\"x4\", rand())\r\nfor i in range(5):\r\n\tstart = time.time()\r\n\t_ = df.toPandas()\r\n\telapsed = time.time() - start\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrent Master | This PR\r\n---------------------|------------\r\n5.803557 | 5.16207\r\n5.409119 | 5.133671\r\n5.493509 | 5.147513\r\n5.433107 | 5.105243\r\n5.488757 | 5.018685\r\n\r\nAvg Master | Avg This PR\r\n------------------|--------------\r\n5.5256098 | 5.1134364\r\n\r\nSpeedup of **1.08060595**\r\n\r\n\r\n## Performance Tests - createDataFrame\r\n\r\nTests run on a 4 node standalone cluster with 32 cores total, 14.04.1-Ubuntu and OpenJDK 8\r\nmeasured wall clock time to execute `createDataFrame()` and get the first record.

Before, the entire dataset was collected in the JVM first before sending it to Python.  With this change, as soon as a partition is collected, the result handler immediately sends it to Python, so the upper bound is the size of the largest partition.  Also, using the Arrow stream format is more efficient because the schema is written once per stream, followed by record batches.  The schema is now only send from driver JVM to Python.  Before, multiple Arrow file formats were used that each contained the schema.  This duplicated schema was created in the executors, sent to the driver JVM, and then Python where all but the first one received are discarded.\r\n\r\nI verified the upper bound limit by running a test that would collect data that would exceed the amount of driver JVM memory available.  Using these settings on a standalone cluster:\r\n```\r\nspark.driver.memory 1g\r\nspark.executor.memory 5g\r\nspark.sql.execution.arrow.enabled true\r\nspark.sql.execution.arrow.fallback.enabled false\r\nspark.sql.execution.arrow.maxRecordsPerBatch 0\r\nspark.driver.maxResultSize 2g\r\n```\r\n\r\nTest code:\r\n```python\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import rand\r\ndf = spark.range(1 << 25, numPartitions=32).toDF(\"id\").withColumn(\"x1\", rand()).withColumn(\"x2\", rand()).withColumn(\"x3\", rand())\r\ndf.toPandas()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis makes total data size of 33554432×8×4 = 1073741824\r\n\r\nWith the current master, it fails with OOM but passes using this PR.\r\n\r\n**createDataFrame()**\r\n\r\nNo significant change in memory except that using the stream format instead of separate file formats avoids duplicated the schema, similar to toPandas above.  The process of reading the stream and parallelizing the batches does cause the record batch message metadata to be copied, but it's size is insignificant.","created_at":"2018-06-12T21:33:19Z","updated_at":"2018-08-30T00:04:35Z","closed_at":"2018-08-29T07:05:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8838ac2047ae183cc3597b41f6f7c15595a03095","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21546/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21546/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21546/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ffb47cb2d411b91e240ab40cd6bd75b025e417c2","head":{"label":"BryanCutler:arrow-toPandas-stream-SPARK-23030","ref":"arrow-toPandas-stream-SPARK-23030","sha":"ffb47cb2d411b91e240ab40cd6bd75b025e417c2","user":{"login":"BryanCutler","id":4534389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzQzODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4534389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler","html_url":"https://github.com/BryanCutler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34092463,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDA5MjQ2Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"BryanCutler/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"BryanCutler","id":4534389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzQzODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4534389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler","html_url":"https://github.com/BryanCutler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BryanCutler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/BryanCutler/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIf you construct catalyst trees using `scala.collection.immutable.Stream` you can run into situations where valid transformations do not seem to have any effect. There are two causes for this behavior:\r\n- `Stream` is evaluated lazily. Note that default implementation will generally only evaluate a function for the first element (this makes testing a bit tricky).\r\n- `TreeNode` and `QueryPlan` use side effects to detect if a tree has changed. Mapping over a stream is lazy and does not need to trigger this side effect. If this happens the node will invalidly assume that it did not change and return itself instead if the newly created node (this is for GC reasons).\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this issue by forcing materialization on streams in `TreeNode` and `QueryPlan`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests were added to `TreeNodeSuite` and `LogicalPlanSuite`. An integration test was added to the `PlannerSuite`","created_at":"2018-06-12T10:02:13Z","updated_at":"2018-06-13T14:14:26Z","closed_at":"2018-06-13T14:14:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6a9c937e2c9fd654f6b04f934056d1105aea1a3f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21539/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21539/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21539/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d5832f4b50d4c8f84feb462291d8da37e87b192f","head":{"label":"hvanhovell:SPARK-24500","ref":"SPARK-24500","sha":"d5832f4b50d4c8f84feb462291d8da37e87b192f","user":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35900688,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTkwMDY4OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"hvanhovell/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell/spark","description":"Mirror

was fixed in #21383 by changing the UDF code to wrap the user function, but this required a hack to save its argspec. This PR reverts this change and fixes the `StopIteration` bug in the worker.\r\n\r\nThe root of the problem is that when an user-supplied function raises a `StopIteration`, pyspark might stop processing data, if this function is used in a for-loop. The solution is to catch `StopIteration`s exceptions and re-raise them as `RuntimeError`s, so that the execution fails and the error is reported to the user. This is done using the `fail_on_stopiteration` wrapper, in different ways depending on where the function is used:\r\n - In RDDs, the user function is wrapped in the driver, because this function is also called in the driver itself.\r\n - In SQL UDFs, the function is wrapped in the worker, since all processing happens there. Moreover, the worker needs the signature of the user function, which is lost when wrapping it, but passing this signature to the worker requires a not so nice hack.\r\n\r\n@HyukjinKwon

uses hardcoded value of 2000 partitions to determine if it should use highly compressed map status. We should make it configurable to allow users to more easily tune their jobs with respect to this without having for them to modify their code to change the number of partitions.  Note we can leave this as an internal/undocumented config for now until we have more advise for the users on how to set this config.\r\nSome of my reasoning:\r\nThe config gives you a way to easily change something without the user having to change code, redeploy jar, and then run again. You can simply change the config and rerun. It also allows for easier experimentation. Changing the # of partitions has other side affects, whether good or bad is situation dependent. It can be worse are you could be increasing # of output files when you don't want to be, affects the # of tasks needs and thus executors to run in parallel, etc.\r\nThere have been various talks about this number at spark summits where people have told customers to increase it to be 2001 partitions. Note if you just do a search for spark 2000 partitions you will fine various things all talking about this number.  This shows that people are modifying their code to take this into account so it seems to me having this configurable would be better.\r\nOnce we have more advice for users we could expose this and document information on it.\r\n\r\n**What changes were proposed in this pull request?**\r\nI make the hardcoded value mentioned above to be configurable under the name _SHUFFLE_MIN_NUM_PARTS_TO_HIGHLY_COMPRESS_, which has default value to be 2000. Users can set it to the value they want by setting the property name _spark.shuffle.minNumPartitionsToHighlyCompress_ \r\n\r\n**How was this patch tested?**\r\nI wrote a unit test to make sure that the default value is 2000, and  _IllegalArgumentException_ will be thrown if user set it to a non-positive value. The unit test also checks that highly compressed map status is correctly used when the number of partition is greater than _SHUFFLE_MIN_NUM_PARTS_TO_HIGHLY_COMPRESS_.","created_at":"2018-06-11T14:29:49Z","updated_at":"2018-09-21T16:45:15Z","closed_at":"2018-06-22T14:21:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c79d4db609e8140cc0d32f113a3929289b6ddfa4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21527/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21527/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21527/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4cb492ed483c73acdd8f77aef524582ce4dcedff","head":{"label":"hthuynh2:spark_branch_1","ref":"spark_branch_1","sha":"4cb492ed483c73acdd8f77aef524582ce4dcedff","user":{"login":"hthuynh2","id":15680678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NjgwNjc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15680678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hthuynh2","html_url":"https://github.com/hthuynh2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hthuynh2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hthuynh2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hthuynh2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hthuynh2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hthuynh2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hthuynh2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hthuynh2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hthuynh2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hthuynh2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":136668094,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzY2NjgwOTQ=","name":"spark","full_name":"hthuynh2/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hthuynh2","id":15680678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NjgwNjc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15680678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hthuynh2","html_url":"https://github.com/hthuynh2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hthuynh2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hthuynh2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hthuynh2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hthuynh2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hthuynh2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hthuynh2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hthuynh2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hthuynh2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hthuynh2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hthuynh2/spark","description":"Mirror
