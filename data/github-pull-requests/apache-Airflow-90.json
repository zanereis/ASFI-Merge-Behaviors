`airflow-github` tooling had a check if PR has been already merged, but the PR did not work well when there was already a PR cherry-picked that referred the PR in question in their log message.\r\n\r\nThe check was done via `git log --grep=#PR` essentially and so it happenes that `--grep` matches not only the first line of the message but the whole log message. So if the log message contained reference to the cherry-picked PR it was seen as merged.\r\n\r\nThis change adds ( ) around and $ to the regexp to match not only the PR number but also parentheses around.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

However, when we install the Kubernetes provider with an old version of Airflow, the provider will be broken because the re2 is not installed automatically, and we need to add it explicitly:\r\n```bash\r\npython -m venv airflow_2_4_3\r\n\r\nairflow_2_4_3/bin/pip install apache_airflow==2.4.3\r\n\r\nairflow_2_4_3/bin/pip install

logs from AWS CloudWatch can take a lot of times or even fail when the log stream is old and no time boundary is specified when querying CloudWatch.\r\n\r\nExample: if you try to look at the logs of an old task on the Airflow UI, it can be very slow or even fail doing so.\r\n\r\nBy setting `start_time` and `end_time` (`end_time` is the most important), it improves drastically the latency. CloudWatch team recommended adding end time for performance to restrict the search space. I tested it with a 10 days old task and I could experience an improvement from 5 seconds to 1 second when fetching task logs from the UI.\r\n\r\nResolves #32897\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

#32204.\r\n\r\nImplement the method `is_authorized()` in auth manager. The purpose of this method is to be the user authorization decision maker. The purpose of this method is to check whether the current user (or any user) is authorized to make an action on a given resource. In this PR I use it only in the decorator `auth.has_access()` but I aim to use it anywhere we need to check user permissions. For more informations on the signature of `is_authorized`, please look at [AIP-56](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/AIP-56+Extensible+user+management) section \"Authorization flow\". \r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

are three layers in the change: First, the test_mode default is changed to take a None instead so we can calculate the value lazily. Second, a global constant is introduced to hold the actual default at runtime, and substitute the value when given None. Finally, a Pytest marker is introduced to set the default to True for selected tests.\r\n\r\nWe could potentially set the value to True globally, but I'm not sure how this would affect older tests that might be less well structured. With this marker mechanism we can hopefully make the process more gradual without breaking a ton of things.\r\n\r\nSee also

This is also was ArgoCD did in https://github.com/argoproj/argo-helm/pull/1937 to mitigate this issue for its users.\r\n\r\n@hussein-awala suggested using a pre-commit hook to check if resources have namespaces added, however I am unsure about how to do it and if it's even possible, since not all resources are namespace-scoped, but I am open for changes here.\r\n\r\ncloses: #31356\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

would like to propose adding a new templated field to kubernetes pod operator. Currently, operator has `pod_template_file` field to create base pod spec but you need to create a file to use this feature. IMHO it might be useful to accept stream or content, thus users might easily configure the base pod spec.\r\n\r\n**Use Case**\r\n\r\nI would like to write airflow dag which clones git repository and mounts volume for cloned branch. Branch name should be parameterized so that users can specify it while running the DAG.

When this happens, the scheduler crashes. See linked [issue](https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/32698) for graphs, traceback, etc.. I see two potential options:\r\n\r\n1. Retry these transactions\r\n2. Skip the check entirely and allow another replica or the next timeout check to run\r\n\r\nAt first, I was leaning toward option 1 but after seeing it in code, I worry that the retries will cause even more deadlocks. That is, if a user set AIRFLOW__DATABASE__MAX_DB_RETRIES to a high number (default is 3) and since AIRFLOW__SCHEDULER__TRIGGER_TIMEOUT_CHECK_INTERVAL already defaults to a very low number, 15s, this could increase deadlock likelihood and cause even more stress on the db. \r\n\r\nTherefore, going with 2. Please let me know what you think. This should allow us to avoid crashing the scheduler when deadlocks occur on this (not as critical) transaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Manual Testing\r\n\r\nStarted breeze with the following configurations set:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nexport AIRFLOW__LOGGING__LOGGING_LEVEL=DEBUG\r\nexport AIRFLOW__SCHEDULER__TRIGGER_TIMEOUT_CHECK_INTERVAL=5\r\n```\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1355\" alt=\"image\"

dnspython and Flask Application Builder have a weird transitive dependency to openssl. It does not require it - it is an optional dependnency of email validator that uses dnspython and the dnspython uses pyopenssl when installed. This is all fine. But when opendns is used with older FAB < 4.1.4) and NEWER opensl (>=23.0), just creating the FAB applicatio in flask causes an exception than there is a missing parameter in openssl.\r\n\r\nSince openssl is NOT declared as required dependency in neither FAB nor dnspython, installing airflow with constraints while having a newer version of pyopenssl does not downgrade pyopenssl it is just mentioned in a conflicting message resulting from conflicts with other packages already installed (such as cryptography).\r\n\r\nThis caused a problem when installin older airflow version in breeze with --use-airflow-version switch.\r\n\r\nAlso - during checking this issue, it turned out that we were not\r\n- by default - using the constraints for older version when installing it in breeze (you could do that by explicitly specifying the constraints). This was because when you used anoter way to specify versio (commit hash, tag) it is quite complex to figure out which constraints to use. However we can automatically derive constraints when you specify version, or branch, which are the most common scenarios.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the `--use-airflow-version` case for Airflow 2.4 and below by:\r\n\r\n* automatically deriving the right constraints when version or branch are used in `--use-airflow-version`\r\n\r\n* adding pyopenssl specifically as dependency when --use-airflow-version switch is used.\r\n\r\n* also a small quality of life improvment - when airflow db migrate fails (because old versio of airflow does not support it) - we inform the user that it happened and that we are attempting to run the legacy airflow db init instead.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

sqlite started to fail randomly during teardown of `test_xcom_map_nest` or `test_xcom_map_zip_nest`. \r\nIt looks very strange:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsqlite3.ProgrammingError: SQLite objects created in a thread can only be\r\nused in that same thread\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy analysing possible reasons it seems that it was a side effect of the existing `test_xcom_map_nest` that allocated a new session in the run method of task instance rather than pass the sesion that is created and torrn down in the pytest fixture.\r\n\r\nThe hypothesis is that the session created in the ``test_xcom_map_nest`` were being reclaimed and closed while the `test_xcom_map_zip_nest` test was already starting in a different thread started by Pytest.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to pass the session object to run method of the taskinstance in the ``test_xcom_map_nest`` test.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

Split PR form #31301 to reduce volume and concerns --\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the behavior of the `Param` class and resolves problems found while implementing #31301. Problems found there:\r\n\r\n* If no default was provided to `Param` object the `ArgNotSet` Object was passed out as value when `dump()` was called - now if no default is provided, this is now masked with `None`.\r\n* If `None` was provided as default the check for `has_value` returned `True` which is not really expected.\r\n* If no default value was provided to `Param` and the value was initialized to `ArgNotSet` then during DAG serialization the object in the value was converted to a string representation. Upon de-serialization a `Param` with no default came out with the default value `<airflow.utils.types.ArgNotSet object at 0x7fb1c6344c40>` as string. Fixed serialization and now the `ArgNotSet` object is supported to be serialized/deserialized properly.\r\n\r\nAdjusted pytests accordingly to prevent a regression.","created_at":"2023-08-05T13:21:33Z","updated_at":"2023-10-28T08:22:52Z","closed_at":"2023-08-16T06:04:53Z","merged_at":"2023-08-16T06:04:53Z","merge_commit_sha":"489ca1494691f6a0b717f9312e0ab8a2a7f76d96","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"bolkedebruin","id":4282712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4282712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin","html_url":"https://github.com/bolkedebruin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1769805151,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzY5ODA1MTUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:serialization","name":"area:serialization","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2172803017,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcyODAzMDE3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:bug-fix","name":"type:bug-fix","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog:

PROD image verification happens after the images are pulled in the \"wait for PROD images\" step. This verification is pretty helpful in detecting cases where there are some \"installed airflow\" problems (for example recently it helped to avoid a circular import problem in #33081 as one of the tests failed when images were verified.

#32810, \"airflow db migrate\" command has been added and it\r\nis used by `start-airflow` command. There were a few edge cases\r\nnot covered and this PR completes it.\r\n\r\n* We can move the \"database/load_default_connections\" configuration\r\n  to a new \"deprecated\" section. This is the first time we remove\r\n  the option completely as it lost its meaning, but we likely\r\n  still want to explain that the option was there and what it does\r\n  when deprecated \"db init\" command is used.\r\n\r\nIt has no meaning when you use \"airflow db migrate\" or when you run the\r\nnew \"airflow connections create-default-connections\" commands. So we can\r\nnow remove it completely from configuraiton. It will still work\r\nin the \"airflow db init\" which is deprecated, as long as we provide an\r\nexplicit fallback. Also if someone had it defined in their config or\r\nenv variable, it will continue to work even if it is not defined.\r\n\r\n* We need to explain the change in a significant newsfragment.\r\n\r\n* The ``start-airflow`` command supports creating default connections\r\n  with ``--load-default-connections`` flag. This was lost after\r\n  the change so this PR brings it back by running the new\r\n  \"airflow connections create-default-connections\" command if the\r\n  flag is used.\r\n\r\n* The `start-airflow` breeze command can be used to start older\r\n  versions of airflow - with ``--use-airflow-version\" - those that do not\r\n  support `airflow db migrate` command. In this case the old behaviour is\r\n  used with setting the \"AIRFLOW__DATABASE__LOAD_DEFAULT_CONNECTIONS\"\r\n  based on the flag passed and running \"airflow db init\" instead.\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

To test locally, rebuild the breeze image with elasticsearch constraint set up `elasticsearch>8,<9`, set up elasticsearch 8 , kibana & filebeat in docker respectively, with the following changes to the `airflow.cfg`\r\n\r\n```\r\n[logging]\r\nremote_logging = True\r\n\r\n[elasticsearch]\r\njson_format = True\r\nhost = http://host.docker.internal:9200\r\nhost_field = host.name\r\noffset_field = log.offset\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that with the latest es package, host field under `elasticsearch` has to be a full URL starting with `http://` or `https://`.
