What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes local mode for Spark Connect. It automatically starts a Spark session (with bypassing `local*` master string) that launches the Spark Connect server, which introduces two user-facing changes below.\r\n\r\nNotice that local mode exactly follows the regular PySpark session's stop behavior by terminating the server (whereas non-local mode would not close the server and other sessions). See also the newly added comments for `pyspark.sql.connect.SparkSession.stop`.\r\n\r\n#### Local build of Apache Spark (for developers)\r\n\r\nAutomatically finds the jars for Spark Connect (because the jars for Spark Connect are not bundled in the regular Apache Spark release).\r\n\r\n- PySpark shell \r\n    ```bash\r\n    pyspark --remote local\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n- PySpark application submission\r\n    ```bash\r\n    spark-submit --remote \"local[4]\" app.py\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n- Use it as a Python library\r\n    ```python\r\n    from pyspark.sql import SparkSession\r\n    SparkSession.builder.remote(\"local[*]\").getOrCreate()\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n#### Official release of Apache Spark (for end-users)\r\n\r\nUsers must specify jars or packages. Jars aren't automatically searched.\r\n\r\n- PySpark shell \r\n    ```bash\r\n    pyspark --packages org.apache.spark:spark-connect_2.12:3.4.0 --remote local\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n- PySpark application submission\r\n    ```bash\r\n    spark-submit --packages org.apache.spark:spark-connect_2.12:3.4.0 --remote \"local[4]\" app.py\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n- Use it as a Python library\r\n    ```python\r\n    from pyspark.sql import SparkSession\r\n    SparkSession.builder.config(\r\n        \"spark.jars.packages\", \"org.apache.spark:spark-connect_2.12:3.4.0\"\r\n    ).remote(\"local[*]\").getOrCreate()\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn order to provide an easier mode to try Spark Connect for both developers and end-users.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo to end users because Spark Connect has not been released.\r\nTo the dev, yes. See the examples above.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnittests were refactored to use/test this feature (that also deduplicated the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe `FileFormatWriter` materializes an `AdaptiveQueryPlan` before accessing the plan's `outputOrdering`. This is required when planned writing is disabled (`spark.sql.optimizer.plannedWrite.enabled` is `true` by default). With planned writing enabled `FileFormatWriter` gets the final plan already.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n`FileFormatWriter` enforces an ordering if the written plan does not provide that ordering. An `AdaptiveQueryPlan` does not know its final ordering, in which case `FileFormatWriter` enforces the ordering (e.g. by column `\"a\"`) even if the plan provides a compatible ordering (e.g. by columns `\"a\", \"b\"`). In case of spilling, that order (e.g. by columns `\"a\", \"b\"`) gets broken (see SPARK-40588).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nThis fixes SPARK-40588 for 3.4, which was introduced in 3.0. This restores behaviour from Spark 2.4.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThe final plan that is written to files is now stored in `FileFormatWriter.executedPlan` (similar to existing `FileFormatWriter.outputOrderingMatched`). Unit tests assert the outermost sort order written to files.\r\n\r\nThe actual plan written into the files changed from (taken from `\"SPARK-41914: v1 write with AQE and in-partition sorted - non-string partition column\"`):\r\n\r\n```\r\nSort [input[2, int, false] ASC NULLS FIRST], false, 0\r\n+- *(3) Sort [key#13 ASC NULLS FIRST, value#14 ASC NULLS FIRST], false, 0\r\n   +- *(3) Project

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nMake stage scheduling support local-cluster mode.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis is useful in testing, especially for test code of third-party python libraries that depends on pyspark, many tests are written with pytest, but pytest is hard to integrate with a standalone spark cluster.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to reeanble `test_rand_functions` test by fixing the regular PySpark tests.\r\n\r\nPreviously, it fails in Spark Connect because `self.df` is created before Spark Connect server is started. So `self.df` reminds as a regular PySpark DataFrame (not Spark Connect DataFrame).\r\n\r\nThis PR just moves the DataFrame creation into the test itself so Spark Connect server and client are properly started first (at `setUpClass`).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFor test parity.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, test-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually ran the

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe commit https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/38029 actually intended to do the right thing: it checks CTE more aggressively even if a CTE is not used, which is ok. However, it triggers an existing issue where a subquery checks itself but in the CTE case if the subquery contains a CTE which is defined outside of the subquery, the check will fail as CTE not found (e.g. key not found).\r\n\r\nSo it is:\r\n\r\nthe commit checks more thus in the repro examples, every CTE is checked now (in the past only used CTE is checked).\r\n\r\nOne of the CTE that is checked after the commit in the example contains subquery.\r\n\r\nThe subquery contains another CTE which is defined outside of the subquery.\r\n\r\nThe subquery checks itself thus fail due to CTE not found.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the issue by removing the subquery self-validation on CTE case.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis fixed a regression that \r\n```\r\n    val df = sql(\"\"\"\r\n                   |    WITH\r\n                   |    cte1 as (SELECT 1 col1),\r\n                   |    cte2 as (SELECT (SELECT MAX(col1) FROM cte1))\r\n                   |    SELECT * FROM cte1\r\n                   |\"\"\".stripMargin\r\n    )\r\n    checkAnswer(df, Row(1) :: Nil)\r\n```\r\n\r\ncannot pass analyzer anymore.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nBackport #39131 to branch-3.1.\r\n\r\nRule `PushDownLeftSemiAntiJoin` should not push an anti-join below an `Aggregate` when the join condition references an attribute that exists in its right plan and its left plan's child. This usually happens when the anti-join / semi-join is a self-join while `DeduplicateRelations` cannot deduplicate those attributes (in this example due to the projection of `value` to `id`).\r\n\r\nThis behaviour already exists for `Project` and `Union`, but `Aggregate` lacks this safety guard.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWithout this change, the optimizer creates an incorrect plan.\r\n\r\nThis example fails with `distinct()` (an aggregation), and succeeds without `distinct()`, but both queries are identical:\r\n```scala\r\nval ids = Seq(1, 2, 3).toDF(\"id\").distinct()\r\nval result = ids.withColumn(\"id\", $\"id\" + 1).join(ids, Seq(\"id\"), \"left_anti\").collect()\r\nassert(result.length == 1)\r\n```\r\nWith `distinct()`, rule `PushDownLeftSemiAntiJoin` creates a join condition `(value#907 + 1) = value#907`, which can never be true. This effectively removes the anti-join.\r\n\r\n**Before this PR:**\r\nThe anti-join is fully removed from the plan.\r\n```\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\nAdaptiveSparkPlan (16)\r\n+- == Final Plan ==\r\n   LocalTableScan (1)\r\n\r\n(16) AdaptiveSparkPlan\r\nOutput [1]: [id#900]\r\nArguments: isFinalPlan=true\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is caused by `PushDownLeftSemiAntiJoin` adding join condition `(value#907 + 1) = value#907`, which is wrong as because `id#910` in `(id#910 + 1) AS id#912` exists in the right child of the join as well as in the left grandchild:\r\n```\r\n=== Applying Rule org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.optimizer.PushDownLeftSemiAntiJoin ===\r\n!Join LeftAnti, (id#912 = id#910)                  Aggregate [id#910], [(id#910 + 1) AS id#912]\r\n!:- Aggregate [id#910], [(id#910 + 1) AS id#912]   +- Project [value#907 AS id#910]\r\n!:  +- Project [value#907 AS id#910]                  +- Join LeftAnti, ((value#907 + 1) = value#907)\r\n!:     +- LocalRelation [value#907]                      :- LocalRelation [value#907]\r\n!+- Aggregate [id#910], [id#910]                         +- Aggregate [id#910], [id#910]\r\n!   +- Project [value#914 AS id#910]                        +- Project [value#914 AS id#910]\r\n!      +- LocalRelation [value#914]                            +- LocalRelation [value#914]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe right child of the join and in the left grandchild would become the children of the pushed-down join, which creates an invalid join condition.\r\n\r\n**After this PR:**\r\nJoin condition `(id#910 + 1) AS id#912` is understood to become ambiguous as both sides of the prospect join contain `id#910`. Hence, the join is not pushed down. The rule is then not applied any more.\r\n\r\nThe final plan contains the anti-join:\r\n```\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\nAdaptiveSparkPlan (24)\r\n+- == Final Plan ==\r\n   * BroadcastHashJoin LeftSemi

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAs described in [SPARK-41848](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-41848), we update the [executor's free cores](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/scheduler/cluster/CoarseGrainedSchedulerBackend.scala#L424) based on executor's resource profile. For tasks with TaskResourceProfile in standalone cluster, since executors with default resource profile can be reused across different TaskResourceProfiles, and the task cpus can be different from the value we get from executor's resource profile.\r\n\r\nThe changes to fix the issues:\r\n1. Decrease executor free cores when launch tasks by taskCpus from `TaskDescription`;\r\n2. Adding taskCpus to `StatusUpdate` as well as the other resources, so that taskCpus can be reported when task is finished and we can increase executor free cores by the reported taskCpus;\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFixing the bug as described in [SPARK-41848](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-41848)\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nBackport #39131 to branch-3.3.\r\n\r\nRule `PushDownLeftSemiAntiJoin` should not push an anti-join below an `Aggregate` when the join condition references an attribute that exists in its right plan and its left plan's child. This usually happens when the anti-join / semi-join is a self-join while `DeduplicateRelations` cannot deduplicate those attributes (in this example due to the projection of `value` to `id`).\r\n\r\nThis behaviour already exists for `Project` and `Union`, but `Aggregate` lacks this safety guard.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWithout this change, the optimizer creates an incorrect plan.\r\n\r\nThis example fails with `distinct()` (an aggregation), and succeeds without `distinct()`, but both queries are identical:\r\n```scala\r\nval ids = Seq(1, 2, 3).toDF(\"id\").distinct()\r\nval result = ids.withColumn(\"id\", $\"id\" + 1).join(ids, Seq(\"id\"), \"left_anti\").collect()\r\nassert(result.length == 1)\r\n```\r\nWith `distinct()`, rule `PushDownLeftSemiAntiJoin` creates a join condition `(value#907 + 1) = value#907`, which can never be true. This effectively removes the anti-join.\r\n\r\n**Before this PR:**\r\nThe anti-join is fully removed from the plan.\r\n```\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\nAdaptiveSparkPlan (16)\r\n+- == Final Plan ==\r\n   LocalTableScan (1)\r\n\r\n(16) AdaptiveSparkPlan\r\nOutput [1]: [id#900]\r\nArguments: isFinalPlan=true\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is caused by `PushDownLeftSemiAntiJoin` adding join condition `(value#907 + 1) = value#907`, which is wrong as because `id#910` in `(id#910 + 1) AS id#912` exists in the right child of the join as well as in the left grandchild:\r\n```\r\n=== Applying Rule org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.optimizer.PushDownLeftSemiAntiJoin ===\r\n!Join LeftAnti, (id#912 = id#910)                  Aggregate [id#910], [(id#910 + 1) AS id#912]\r\n!:- Aggregate [id#910], [(id#910 + 1) AS id#912]   +- Project [value#907 AS id#910]\r\n!:  +- Project [value#907 AS id#910]                  +- Join LeftAnti, ((value#907 + 1) = value#907)\r\n!:     +- LocalRelation [value#907]                      :- LocalRelation [value#907]\r\n!+- Aggregate [id#910], [id#910]                         +- Aggregate [id#910], [id#910]\r\n!   +- Project [value#914 AS id#910]                        +- Project [value#914 AS id#910]\r\n!      +- LocalRelation [value#914]                            +- LocalRelation [value#914]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe right child of the join and in the left grandchild would become the children of the pushed-down join, which creates an invalid join condition.\r\n\r\n**After this PR:**\r\nJoin condition `(id#910 + 1) AS id#912` is understood to become ambiguous as both sides of the prospect join contain `id#910`. Hence, the join is not pushed down. The rule is then not applied any more.\r\n\r\nThe final plan contains the anti-join:\r\n```\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\nAdaptiveSparkPlan (24)\r\n+- == Final Plan ==\r\n   * BroadcastHashJoin LeftSemi BuildRight (14)\r\n   :- * HashAggregate (7)\r\n   :  +- AQEShuffleRead (6)\r\n   :     +- ShuffleQueryStage (5), Statistics(sizeInBytes=48.0 B, rowCount=3)\r\n   :        +- Exchange (4)\r\n   :

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to\r\n- attach root cause to invalidPatternError(passing e as the cause to SparkRuntimeException).\r\n- refactor error classes

accurate, eg:\r\nIt seems more reasonable to call `<value>` instead of `<expected>`\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/f352f103ed512806abb3f642571a0c595b8b0509/core/src/main/resources/error/error-classes.json#L790-L795\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass

https://www.activestate.com/blog/why-the-us-government-is-mandating-software-bill-of-materials-sbom/\r\n\r\nSoftware Bill of Materials (SBOM) are additional artifacts containing the aggregate of all direct and transitive dependencies of a project. The US Government (based on NIST recommendations) currently accepts only the three most popular SBOM standards as valid, namely: [CycloneDX](https://cyclonedx.org/), [Software Identification (SWID) tag](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/Software-Identification-SWID), [Software Package Data Exchange® (SPDX)](https://spdx.dev/).\r\n\r\nThis PR uses [CycloneDX maven plugin](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-maven-plugin), a lightweight software bill of materials (SBOM) standard designed for use in application security contexts and supply chain component analysis.\r\n\r\nFor example, `spark-tags_2.12-3.4.0-SNAPSHOT-cyclonedx.xml` and `spark-tags_2.12-3.4.0-SNAPSHOT-cyclonedx.json` files are attached to `spark-tags_2.12-3.4.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`.\r\n```\r\n$ ls -al ~/.m2/repository/org/apache/spark/spark-tags_2.12/3.4.0-SNAPSHOT\r\ntotal 2488\r\ndrwxr-xr-x  12 dongjoon  staff      384 Jan  4 23:36 .\r\ndrwxr-xr-x   4 dongjoon  staff      128 Jan  4 23:36 ..\r\n-rw-r--r--   1 dongjoon  staff      492 Jan  4 23:36 _remote.repositories\r\n-rw-r--r--   1 dongjoon  staff     1955 Jan  4 23:36 maven-metadata-local.xml\r\n-rw-r--r--   1 dongjoon  staff    16310 Jan  4 23:36 spark-tags_2.12-3.4.0-SNAPSHOT-cyclonedx.json\r\n-rw-r--r--   1 dongjoon  staff    14045 Jan  4 23:36 spark-tags_2.12-3.4.0-SNAPSHOT-cyclonedx.xml\r\n-rw-r--r--   1 dongjoon  staff  1162027 Jan  4 23:36 spark-tags_2.12-3.4.0-SNAPSHOT-javadoc.jar\r\n-rw-r--r--   1 dongjoon  staff    16272 Jan  4 23:36 spark-tags_2.12-3.4.0-SNAPSHOT-sources.jar\r\n-rw-r--r--   1 dongjoon  staff    12453 Jan  4 23:36 spark-tags_2.12-3.4.0-SNAPSHOT-test-sources.jar\r\n-rw-r--r--   1 dongjoon  staff    10387 Jan  4 23:36 spark-tags_2.12-3.4.0-SNAPSHOT-tests.jar\r\n-rw-r--r--   1 dongjoon  staff    15181 Jan  4 23:36 spark-tags_2.12-3.4.0-SNAPSHOT.jar\r\n-rw-r--r--   1 dongjoon  staff     5822 Jan  4 23:36 spark-tags_2.12-3.4.0-SNAPSHOT.pom\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, but dev-only changes.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually test.\r\n```\r\n$ mvn install -DskipTests\r\n...\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Reactor Summary for Spark Project Parent POM 3.4.0-SNAPSHOT:\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Spark Project Parent POM ...........................

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSimilar to SPARK-41709, this pr aims to avoid `toSeq` in `RDDOperationGraphWrapperSerializer` and `SparkPlanGraphWrapperSerializer` to make no performance difference between Scala 2.13 and Scala 2.12 when create ui objects from protobuf objects, the `Seq` in related `ui` class also explicitly defined as `collection.Seq` in this pr.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAvoid collection conversion when creating ui objects from protobuf objects for Scala 2.13.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass GitHub

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to introduce `pyspark.errors` and error classes to unifying & improving errors generated by PySpark under a single path.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, this PR includes the changes below:\r\n- Add `python/pyspark/errors/error_classes.py` to support error class for PySpark.\r\n- Add `ErrorClassesReader` to manage the `error_classes.py`.\r\n- Add `PySparkException` to handle the errors generated by PySpark.\r\n- Add `check_error` for error class testing.\r\n\r\nThis is an initial PR for introducing error framework for PySpark to facilitate the error management and provide better/consistent error messages to users.\r\n\r\nWhile such an active work is being done on the [SQL side to improve error messages](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-37935), so far there is no work to improve error messages in PySpark.\r\n\r\nSo, I'd expect to also initiate the effort on error message improvement for PySpark side from this PR.\r\n\r\nEventually, the errors massage will be shown as below, for example:\r\n\r\n- PySpark, `PySparkException` (thrown by Python driver):\r\n```python\r\n>>> from pyspark.sql.functions import lit\r\n>>> lit([df.id, df.id])\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n  File \".../spark/python/pyspark/sql/utils.py\", line 334, in wrapped\r\n    return f(*args, **kwargs)\r\n  File \".../spark/python/pyspark/sql/functions.py\", line 176, in lit\r\n    raise PySparkException(\r\npyspark.errors.exceptions.PySparkException: [COLUMN_IN_LIST] lit does not allow a column in a list.\r\n```\r\n\r\n- PySpark, `AnalysisException` (thrown by JVM side, and capture in PySpark side):\r\n```\r\n>>> df.unpivot(\"id\", [], \"var\", \"val\").collect()\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n  File \".../spark/python/pyspark/sql/dataframe.py\", line 3296, in unpivot\r\n    jdf = self._jdf.unpivotWithSeq(jids, jvals, variableColumnName, valueColumnName)\r\n  File \".../spark/python/lib/py4j-0.10.9.7-src.zip/py4j/java_gateway.py\", line 1322, in __call__\r\n  File \".../spark/python/pyspark/sql/utils.py\", line 209, in deco\r\n    raise converted from None\r\npyspark.sql.utils.AnalysisException: [UNPIVOT_REQUIRES_VALUE_COLUMNS] At least one value column needs to be specified for UNPIVOT, all columns specified as ids;\r\n'Unpivot ArraySeq(id#2L), ArraySeq(), var, [val]\r\n+- LogicalRDD [id#2L, int#3L, double#4, str#5], false\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Spark, `AnalysisException`:\r\n```scala\r\nscala> df.select($\"id\").unpivot(Array($\"id\"), Array.empty,variableColumnName = \"var\", valueColumnName = \"val\")\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: [UNPIVOT_REQUIRES_VALUE_COLUMNS] At least one value column needs to be specified for UNPIVOT, all columns specified as ids;\r\n'Unpivot ArraySeq(id#0L), ArraySeq(), var, [val]\r\n+- Project [id#0L]\r\n   +- Range (0, 10, step=1, splits=Some(16))\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Next up** for this PR include:\r\n- Migrate more errors into `PySparkException` across all modules (e.g, Spark Connect, pandas API on Spark...).\r\n- Migrate more error tests into error class tests  by using `check_error`.\r\n- Define more error classes onto `error_classes.py`.\r\n- Add documentation.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCentralizing error messages & introducing identified error class provides the following benefits:\r\n- Errors are searchable via the unique class names and properly classified.\r\n- Reduce the cost of future maintenance for PySpark errors.\r\n- Provide consistent & actionable error messages to users.\r\n- Facilitates translating error messages into different languages.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdding UTs & running the existing static analysis tools (`dev/lint-python`)","created_at":"2023-01-04T11:03:42Z","updated_at":"2023-04-22T05:44:45Z","closed_at":"2023-01-16T01:22:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e7b82cac001cdc4dac2280ebd88ba6fb60cd6717","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39387/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39387/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/39387/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/37a6855c8b6ed722bd3a25c1f496b4907f7b7fc0","head":{"label":"itholic:SPARK-41586","ref":"SPARK-41586","sha":"37a6855c8b6ed722bd3a25c1f496b4907f7b7fc0","user":{"login":"itholic","id":44108233,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTA4MjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44108233?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic","html_url":"https://github.com/itholic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":445423122,"node_id":"R_kgDOGoyeEg","name":"spark","full_name":"itholic/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"itholic","id":44108233,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTA4MjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44108233?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic","html_url":"https://github.com/itholic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/itholic/spark","description":"Apache

None/NaN values;\r\n2, ArrayType\r\n3, BinaryType\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo be consistent with PySpark\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIntroduce Arrow-optimized Python UDFs.

Otherwise, `useArrow` decides whether a specific user-defined function is optimized by Arrow or not.\r\n\r\nThe reason why we introduce these two ways is to provide both a convenient, per-Spark-session control and a finer-grained, per-UDF control of the Arrow optimization for Python UDFs.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nPython user-defined function (UDF) enables users to run arbitrary code against PySpark columns. It uses Pickle for (de)serialization and executes row by row.\r\n\r\nOne major performance bottleneck of Python UDFs is (de)serialization, that is, the data interchanging between the worker JVM and the spawned Python subprocess which actually executes the UDF. \r\n\r\nThe PR proposes a better alternative to handle the (de)serialization: Arrow, which is used in the (de)serialization of Pandas UDF already. \r\n\r\n#### Benchmark\r\n\r\nThe micro benchmarks are conducted in a cluster with 1 driver (i3.2xlarge), 2 workers (i3.2xlarge).  An i3.2xlarge machine has 61 GB Memory, 8 Cores. The datasets used in the benchmarks are generated and sized 5 GB, 10 GB, 20 GB and 40 GB.\r\n\r\nAs shown below, Arrow-optimized Python UDFs are **~1.4x** faster than non-Arrow-optimized Python UDFs.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47337188/210927609-e402e46f-20ee-43d6-9965-32a38d99fdd3.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47337188/210927614-4ac8db7f-083f-41b0-8f9d-efab2e8523b2.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease

user-facing change?\r\nNo, since the Arrow optimization for Python UDFs is disabled by default.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests.\r\n\r\nBelow is the script to generate the result table when the Arrow's type coercion is needed, as in the

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis pr add a new trait `SelectivePredicateHelper` at `sql/core` module that provide a method to find if the plan has selective predicate even if the predicate is in `InMemoryRelation`. The reason why it should be placed in `sql/core` module is the `InMemoryRelation` is at `sql/core`.\r\n\r\nThen, move the `InjectRuntimeFilter` from `sql/catalyst` module to `sql/core` module so it can use the new trait.\r\nAlso make `PartitionPruning` use `SelectivePredicateHelper` instead of `PredicateHelper`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nDPP and Runtime Filter require the build side has a selective predicate. It should also work if the filter is inside the cached relation.\r\nBesides, the runtime filter should consider the overhead of cached plan.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nyes, more cases can be optimized\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdds support for subquery decorrelation with UNION operators on the correlation paths. For example:\r\n```\r\nSELECT t1a, (\r\n  SELECT avg(b) FROM (\r\n    SELECT t2b as b FROM t2 WHERE t2a = t1a\r\n    UNION\r\n    SELECT t3b as b FROM t3 WHERE t3a = t1a\r\n))\r\nFROM t1\r\n```\r\n\r\n[This doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11b9ClCF2jYGU7vU2suOT7LRswYkg6tZ8_6xJbvxfh2I/edit#) describes how the decorrelation rewrite works for UNION and the code changes for it.\r\n\r\nThe other set operators INTERSECT and EXCEPT should work with the same logic, I will add those in a follow-up after this PR is ready.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we always add DomainJoins for correlation through UNIONs, and never do direct substitution of the outer refs. That can also be added as an optimization in a follow-up - it only affects performance, not surface area coverage.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo improve subquery support in Spark.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nBefore this change, queries like this would return an error like: `Decorrelate inner query through Union is not supported.`\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, this query can run successfully.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests and SQL query tests.\r\n\r\nFactors tested included:\r\n- Subquery type:\r\n  - Eligible for DecorrelateInnerQuery: Scalar, lateral join\r\n  - Not supported: EXISTS (new tests) and IN (existing tests)\r\n- UNION inside and outside subquery\r\n- Correlation in where, project, group by, aggregates, or no correlation\r\n- Project, Aggregate, Window under the Union\r\n- COUNT

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNOTE: If you want to only view the diff from the other WIP PR regarding the baseline changes, look at the LAST COMMIT in this PR's commit history (titled \"WIP adding notebook functionality\"). Since I am sending out parallel PRs that are related, you should view this commit to see the diff pertaining to this ticket.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis is an addition to https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/39299 to add support for using functions as the input for distributed training. The users would follow the first workflow in the [design document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QPO1Ly8WteL6aIPvVcR7Xne9qVtJiB3fdrRn7NwBcpA/edit#heading=h.8yvw9xq428fh) to run training.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWe want to make it easier for users to run distributed training from a notebook setting.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUsers can now input a training function into the `PyTorchDistributor().run(...)` api. This will require a lot of additional documentation though since since we are internally using cloudpickle to run training so we need to be able to have the user's train() function be picklable.  \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe `ScanBuilder` interface has the `build()` method to return `Scan` objects. All the different implementations of it return scans that are of the type of the builder itself. Eg `ParquetScanBuilder` will return a `ParquetScan`, `TextScanBuilder` a `TextScan` etc. However, in the method overrides declaration, the return type is not changed to the more specific type but left as a generic `Scan`. For ease of development I'm proposing that the the `build()` methods of each implementation of `ScanBuilder`s returned a more strictly typed object instead of the generic `Scan` object\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhen developing using spark as a library, it can be problematic to deal with the scan types as often manual casting is required when we should know for a fact that typed `ScanBuilder`s return typed scans. In order to avoid having to hard cast objects and have stricter requirements on the return types (We want a `ParquetScanBuilder` to return `ParquetScan`s only) these changes would be really helpful.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNo need to test as we are just changing the declared return type to the effective return type of the scanbuilders.\r\n\r\nThis change is safe because we are making the return type more precise and they are just reflecting what the methods return

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nMake `AvroScanBuilder` and `JsonScanBuilder` case classes from normal classes.\r\n\r\nAll the other existing `ScanBuilder`s inheriting from `FileScanBuilder` are case classes which is very nice and useful. However the Json and the Avro ones aren't, which makes it quite inconvenient when working with those. I don't see any particular reason why these two would not be case classes as well given they are very similar to the other ones and very simple and stateless. Especially when `AvroScan` and `JsonScan` are also already case classes like the other scans.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhen working on using different possible `FileScanBuilder` is really problematic that these 2 ScanBuilders are not case classes, especially given all the others are. This is a very simple change that helps development greatly and allows for more flexibility / feature deelopment when working with ScanBuilders.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNo need for testing as it's a simple change from `class` to `case

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n`CreateHiveTableAsSelectCommand` is used in two APIs:\r\n1. SQL CTAS\r\n2. `DataFrameWriter.saveAsTable`\r\n\r\nFor SQL CTAS, if the table already exists, we either do nothing if `IF NOT EXISTS` is specified, or fail otherwise. This means, `CreateHiveTableAsSelectCommand` from SQL CTAS should only trigger table insertion if table not exists.\r\n\r\nFor `DataFrameWriter.saveAsTable`, it can create the table if it doesn't exist, or append data to the table if `SaveMode` is `Append`. `DataFrameWriter.saveAsTable` will drop the table first if `SaveMode` is `Overwrite`. This means, `CreateHiveTableAsSelectCommand` from `DataFrameWriter.saveAsTable` either appends data to an existing table, or creates a new table.\r\n\r\nIn summary, the table insertion command triggered by `CreateHiveTableAsSelectCommand` should always set `overwrite` to false.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nfix a mistake\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo. If the table does not exist, the `overwrite` flag doesn't matter. But it could be a potential bug in the future.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nexisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is a partial and logical revert of SPARK-39862, https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/37280, to fix the huge ORC reader perf regression (3x slower).\r\n\r\nSPARK-39862 should propose a fix without perf regression.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nDuring Apache Spark 3.4.0 preparation, SPARK-41782 identified a perf regression.\r\n- https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/39301#discussion_r1059239575\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, the regression is removed. However, the bug of DEFAULT value feature will remain. This should be handled separately.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nMake `createDataFrame` handle None/NaN properly\r\n\r\nExisting implementation always convert local data to a Pandas DataFrame, and then a PyArrow Table, this approach can not handle None/NaN properly:\r\n\r\n1, local data -> Pandas DataFrame, method `pd.DataFrame` always convert None in numeric columns into NaN, and there is no parameter to control this behavior;\r\n2, Pandas DataFrame -> PyArrow Table, method `pa.Table.from_pandas` always convert NaN into Null, and there is no parameter to control this behavior;\r\n\r\n```\r\nIn [72]: data = [Row(id=1, value=float(\"NaN\"), s=\"x\"), Row(id=2, value=42.0, s=\"y\"), Row(id=3, value=None, s=None)]\r\n\r\nIn [73]: pdf = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=[\"id\", \"value\", \"s\"])\r\n\r\nIn [74]: pdf\r\nOut[74]: \r\n   id  value     s\r\n0   1    NaN     x\r\n1   2   42.0     y\r\n2   3    NaN  None\r\n\r\nIn [75]: pa.Table.from_pandas(pdf)\r\nOut[75]: \r\npyarrow.Table\r\nid:

works.\r\n\r\n```\r\nIn [76]: pa.Table.from_pylist([d.asDict() for d in data])\r\nOut[76]: \r\npyarrow.Table\r\nid: int64\r\nvalue: double\r\ns: string\r\n----\r\nid: [[1,2,3]]\r\nvalue: [[nan,42,null]]\r\ns: [[\"x\",\"y\",null]]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nto support None and NaN\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nyes\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nadded
