of this PR simply adds UMD (Universal Module Definition) boilerplate around NIFI's existing modules and re-orders the loading of the scripts on the page to match dependencies. However some refactoring was required.\r\n\r\nChanges to be aware of:\r\n\r\n1. Created new method nf.Graph.reload() to be called from nf.CanvasUtils.reloadConnectionSourceAndDestination since nf.Graph module has references to the canvas graph component controllers\r\n2. moved nf.CanvasUtils.enterGroup to nf.ProcessGroup.enterGroup\r\n3. nf.CanvasUtils.editable(...) now has nf.Connectable and nf.Draggable passed as args since the canvas graph components now have private references to the nf.Draggable and nf.Connectable controllers and can pass them along (rather than injecting nf.Connectable and nf.Draggable into nf.CanvasUtils)\r\n4. nf-canvas-bootstrap.js leverages the Inversion Of Control design pattern to remove circular dependencies and allow the Nifi js modules to be unit tested using mocks of the injected controllers\r\n5. nf.CanvasUtils now has a reference to the nf.Canvas (see nf-canvas-bootstrap.js) and now acts as a proxy for calls to the nf.Canvas\r\n6. nf.CanvasUtils now has a reference to the nf.Graph (see nf-canvas-bootstrap.js) and a new method nf.CanvasUtils.getComponentByType() that allows dependent modules to get canvas graph component controllers\r\n\r\n*********************************************************************************\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

when the channel sender fails to send data, closing it to force the creation of a new one next time.\r\n- replace deprecated org.apache.nifi.stream.io by java.io equivalent in classes concerned by this PR.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce the issue, it is easy to start a splunk/splunk:latest docker container and add a TCP receiver to listen on a given port. Start a GenerateFF and a PutSplunk processor, then stop the container, wait a bit to see some errors in NiFi, and start again the container. The processor won't be able to reconnect and will try again and again.\r\n\r\n==================================================\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

code change allows ExecuteSQL to handle queries that return multiple result sets.\r\n\r\nOne existing unit test was failing and the results didn't make sense so I adjusted it. Would be good to get a second pair of eyes on that.\r\n\r\nI performed hand testing against MS SQL Server. In some tests I had to enable `SET NOCOUNT ON`. Results were as expected.\r\n\r\nI put some effort into building a unit test for Derby, but it's not simple... Derby doesn't support submitting multi-statement requests in a single SQL statement, and Stored Procedures are written in Java and require registration.  I tried putting one of these together but ran into issues and decided to scrap it.\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Updated StandardRecordWriter, even though it is now deprecated to consider the encoding behavior of java.io.DataOutputStream.writeUTF() and truncate string values such that the UTF representation will not be longer than that DataOutputStream's 64K UTF format limit.\r\n* Updated the new SchemaRecordWriter class to similarly truncate long Strings that will be written as UTF.\r\n* Add tests to confirm handling of large UTF strings and various edge conditions of UTF string handling.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the

PR is meant for 0.x branch.\r\n\r\n- Marked PutKafka Partition Strategy property as deprecated, as\r\n  Kafka 0.8 client doesn't use 'partitioner.class' as producer property, we don't have to specify it.\r\n- Changed Partition Strategy property from a required one to a dynamic property, so that existing processor config can stay in valid state.\r\n- Fixed partition property to work.\r\n- Route a flow file if it failed to be published due to invalid partition.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask

Marked PutKafka Partition Strategy property as deprecated, as Kafka 0.8 client doesn't use 'partitioner.class' as producer property, we don't have to specify it.\r\n- Changed Partition Strategy

This PR is based on [NIFI-3214: Added fetch and replace to DistributedMapCache](https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/1410) which is under review process. Please review and comment on NIFI-3214 for DistributedCache implementation. This PR focuses on Wait/Notify processors to provide waiting mechanism for multiple signals.\r\n\r\n- Support counters at Wait/Notify processors so that NiFi flow can be configured to wait for N signals\r\n- Extract Wait/Notify logics into WaitNotifyProtocol\r\n- Added FragmentAttributes to manage commonly used fragment attributes\r\n- Changed existing split processors to set 'fragment.identifier' and 'fragment.count', so that Wait can use those to wait for all splits get processed\r\n\r\nA NiFi template file for testing this new capability is available in this [Gist](https://gist.github.com/ijokarumawak/dc81cbfa04bc7ec39e89522653db5ea5). It contains Process Groups for each updated split processors work with Wait/Notify processors looks like below:\r\n\r\n![](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/ijokarumawak/dc81cbfa04bc7ec39e89522653db5ea5/raw/f0259717182d589b542cde1f40c166ffb6b75bec/process-groups.png)\r\n\r\n![](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/ijokarumawak/dc81cbfa04bc7ec39e89522653db5ea5/raw/ef2f58c7eee8734be41bf4b5e9177a3c83412931/split-text.png)\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

no Processor that utilizes these new cache operations yet, but will be added by [JIRA-3216](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-3216). To test client and server communication, please use `org.apache.nifi.distributed.cache.server.TestServerAndClient` test class in `nifi-distributed-cache-server` project. If you need to test it on Mac OS X, then you also have to comment out these lines. Sometime it fails due to JVM issue but sometime it works:\r\n\r\n```\r\nAssume.assumeFalse(\"test is skipped due to build environment being OS X with JDK 1.8. See https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-437\",\r\n    SystemUtils.IS_OS_MAC && SystemUtils.IS_JAVA_1_8);\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Using fetch and replace together can provide optimistic locking for  concurrency control.\r\n- Added fetch to get cache entry with its meta data such as revision number.\r\n- Added replace to update cache only if it has not been updated.\r\n- Added Map Cache protocol version 2 for those new operations.\r\n- Existing operations such as get or put can work with protocol version  1.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with NIFI-XXXX where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically master)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial
