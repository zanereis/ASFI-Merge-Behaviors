SUMMARY\r\nIn order to display the 'View Results' button in the history tab of the SQL Lab, the query must have a `resultsKey`.\r\nWhen the query is executed in sync mode, that key was not properly propagated from the API to the FE, thus, the button did not appeared after execution.\r\n\r\nThe button did appeared once the running polling watching for queries updated, since that fetches fresh results from the api.\r\n\r\nThis PR forwards that key to make the button show for every successfully executed query.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17252075/160002524-d03da706-ab0a-4d6f-b404-639fc12d5a73.mov\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17252075/160002321-6feacd4d-c5af-4c91-8228-3a1858834d3d.mov\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Configure a database for sync mode\r\n2. Run queries in SQL Lab in that database\r\n3. Check query history\r\n\r\nEnsure that, if the queries are successful, the 'View Results' button always displays.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nAdd **Dashboard tab Selector** in alert/report config, following the discussion #18475. This feature's backend support is completed by #17749.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. **Alerts/Reports List View:**\r\n\r\n![4iS3ZVawuH](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27990562/159975090-a67d47d9-dad7-445b-89b8-bc22d7b5a611.gif)\r\n- we will show dashboard layout in a tree structure, and group charts under their parent tab.\r\n- user can pick single dashboard tab for report\r\n- Charts included in the report will be automatically checked/selected, but user can not select single chart. \r\n- if user uncheck all tabs, or dashboard report has no tab selected, we will capture dashboard from its landing page (always default to first tab).\r\n\r\n2.  **Dashboard Shortcut:** \r\n \r\n![r6Z5DZogBa](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27990562/159968121-5560b1e9-bc76-4dae-83c1-cb894cb1b6d5.gif)\r\n- in dashboard context, we will not show dashboard layout.\r\n- user can select default tab (tabs when user landing on dashboard), or currently opened tab.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nCI and manual tests.\r\n\r\n### FUTURE WORKS\r\nThere are a few advanced use-cases are not covered by this PR:\r\n1. Currently we only allow 1 screenshot per email report: User can select single dashboard tab for the email report, but not multiple tabs. We found the UI configuration that allow user to select multiple tabs for a dashboard is a little tricky, it might need extra user research and help from design team.\r\n2. Multiple tabs belong to different parent tabs component: For example, if dashboard layout is: \r\n```\r\nroot \r\n   ROW_1\r\n       TAB_1a  | TAB_1b  | TAB_1c\r\n   ROW_2   \r\n       TAB_2a | TAB_2b | TAB_2c\r\n```\r\nUser can select child tab TAB_1b or TAB_2b, but not both TAB_1b and TAB_2b. The reason is that currently dashboard anchor link only support 1 component id. In order to support children from multiple layout branches, we nee dot improve the dashboard anchor feature first.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\"

SUMMARY\r\nMany small updates to the docs package:\r\n- Remove redundant `package-lock.json` as we're using `yarn` in CI (better to just have one workflow)\r\n- Add missing packages to docs lock file that were introduced in #19289\r\n- Add missing peer dependencies that were emitting warnings\r\n- Bump Docusaurus from `^2.0.0-beta.15` to `^2.0.0-beta.17`\r\n- Fix the alert TODO and bump `antd` (we may consider removing `antd`, as it's only used for this one component)\r\n- Update OpenAPI spec and fix the script that generates it (this should be automated in a follow-up PR)\r\n\r\n###

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently, in the SQL editor inside the Lab, the search available is the native one provided by the browser.\r\n\r\nFor performance reasons, the editor only renders a subset of the entire content. So, the native search cannot find content in the editor that's not currently rendered.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the search mechanism to use the ACE plugin one, which will enable full search inside the editor.\r\nThe search is only enabled if the editor is focused, otherwise the normal native search is used.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17252075/159695557-532bbeb1-494f-4fd0-926e-08f586241427.mov\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17252075/159695513-2614f01a-b462-4ac4-95c4-65a47da9473a.mov\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Open the SQL Lab\r\n2. Write (or copy paste) a large text inside the editor.\r\n\r\nEnsure the search inside the editor can find anything inside it, including text that's not currently visible.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL

SUMMARY\r\nWhen chart's request fails, we wait with displaying an error message until datasources are loaded. However, when datasources request also fails, the chart is stuck in loading state instead of displaying an error. This PR fixes that issue by passing the status of datasets request to the chart renderer, so that when datasources request fails, we display chart's error message.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore: \r\n<img width=\"1792\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/159693305-c79b901a-a77c-4283-af75-3012acb04b94.png\">\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n<img width=\"1792\" alt=\"Screenshot 2022-03-23 at 12 49 29\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/159693459-c56ef32f-31b4-426f-983d-03dc25264b1f.png\">\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1.

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nCurrently we have a series of color schemes (aribnb, d3, superset...) Since we use recycle colors when number of items exceed available colors, the color conflict is easy to occur. For this case we use `tinycolor.analogous` API to get analogous colors to prevent color conflict and the color generation algorithm comes from color consistency.\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n### before\r\n<img width=\"1191\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11830681/159680394-1e8fa999-d41c-40a4-99a3-1a2c753659ae.png\">\r\n\r\n### after\r\n<img width=\"1189\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11830681/159680239-7bbda57d-673f-4d02-b816-7a1a9b39f655.png\">\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis PR implements [`hashids`](https://hashids.org/) based permalinks on both Dashboard and Explore, and deprecates the currently supported integer and UUID based permalinks that were introduced here: #19078.\r\n\r\nOld UUID format (default): `https://host/dashboard/p/035ed596-546d-4563-a482-02d5dd4649d8/`\r\nOld numeric format (optional): `https://host/dashboard/p/1/`\r\nNew format: `https://host/dashboard/p/dVK7AbavkPy/`\r\n\r\nThe motivation for this change is [this discussion](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/19078#discussion_r828558897). TL;DR: `hashids` provide shorter and less hideous permalinks thanks to being base62 (vs UUID which uses a regular base16 hex alphabet) and obfuscate numeric ids in a way that makes it infeasibly difficult to guess the actual id.\r\n\r\nWhen creating a permalink for the first time, the app checks if a \"salt\" has been created for the resource in question (separate for Dashboard and Explore): if not, it creates a 48 character string using [`secrets.token_urlsafe`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/secrets.html#secrets.token_urlsafe) (similar to how the temporary cache keys are currently constructed) and persists it in the key-value store under the \"app\" resource. By automatically generating the salt we avoid the need for introducing new config parameters. By creating separate salts for Dashboard and Explore we ensure that \r\n- the user can't guess permalink ids for Explore based on Dashboard permalinks and vice versa\r\n- No two deployments will have the same permalink salt\r\n\r\nUsing `SECRET_KEY` was not possible for the following reasons:\r\n- It would be shared by both resources (the point made above)\r\n- Rotating the `SECRET_KEY` would have required rotating all permalink keys, which is impossible, as they're \"out in the wild\"\r\n- If a vulnerability were to be exposed in `hashids` compromising the salt, the `SECRET_KEY` could be exposed\r\n\r\nThe minimum length of the hashids key is set at 11 characters: this was mostly an arbitrary decision. However, here's a few reasons that support using 11 chars:\r\n- Relatively short while still retaining good protection against guessability: only after creating 2*10^16 key-value pairs will we need to resort to 12 characters long permalinks\r\n- Youtube appears to have 11 characters long keys. If it works for Youtube, it probably works for the average Superset deployment\r\n\r\n**Note that this will invalidate permalinks created on deployments that have been running with this cherry: #19078. However, since this PR is fairly recent and hasn't been released in an official Apache release, the risk is minimal that this would have been in production use anywhere. Needless to say, this cherry will be included in the forthcoming 1.5.0 version.**\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING

SUMMARY\r\nAdds Duckdb as an embedded, in-process OLAP db engine.\r\nDuckdb can directly query CSV or Parquet files on disk - eventually, we should be able to query Parquet files directly on S3 as well.\r\nSupersedes https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/19265\r\nRelying on https://github.com/Mause/duckdb_engine for the SQLAlchemy implementation, and building on top of  @alitrack's original work.\r\nSince DuckDB is, much like SQLite, an in-process, single-threaded engine, the error handling in `TestConnectionDatabaseCommand.run` feels a bit weird.  Might want to work with @Mause on a narrow exception class for the threading blip.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<img width=\"516\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-03-22 at 3 22 53

duckdb-engine`\r\n- DuckDB appears in the add a database dropdown\r\n- Provide path to a duckdb database on disk in the url, e.g., `duckdb:////Users/whoever/path/to/duck.db`\r\n- in SQL lab, query any tables defined in your on-disk database, tables, schemas, and column defs all appear as normal\r\n- have not tested in-memory a ton but `duckdb:///:memory:` seems to work?\r\n- once you are in SQL Lab, you can directly query parquet or CSV files on disk: `SELECT * from 'test.parquet'` etc.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [x] Has associated issue: https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/14563\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [x] Changes UI\r\n- [ ]

SUMMARY\r\nThe alerts & report modal content is divided into columns, but the content is neither responsive nor fluid, so it doesn't play well on small screen sizes.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces small tweaks to ensure the content from one column does not overflow to the next.\r\nThe timezone selector is reduced when needed & the text inside it is truncated (on small screens).\r\n\r\nA better way to approach this would require using media queries, but the viewport meta tag is not defined and thus the media queries based on width do not work.\r\nIt's a larger discussion to be had the path to introduce responsive design.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore:\r\n![Clipboard 2021-06-10 at 2 38 32

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nWhen we save query without empty description, if we go to savedquery, edit a newly saved one, we would see `None` in description field by clicking `save` button. \r\n\r\nIt was because the `savedqueryviewapi/api/get/<pk>` endpoint returns `None` as a description for the saved query without description.\r\n\r\nI customized response in frontend so that if we get `None` as a description, we will omit `description` field from the response.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable

SUMMARY\r\nIn SQL Lab, after executing a query, any query selected from the history tab (by pressing the edit button) does not fire unless the user modify something in it.\r\n\r\nThis PR does two things:\r\n* Updates the SQL state property when it's changed on the reducer\r\n* Modifies the SQL Editor text selection handling to make sure it properly captures the text selected\r\n\r\n###

are currently dual writing any updates/additions of the SqlaTable to the new Dataset models. We found some errors during update where the new dataset should also be updated, but it doesn't exist. I'm not sure if the dataset wasn't created because when the migration to backfill was run a new SqlaTable was created and we missed it, or we're missing it somewhere else. But for now, I'm catching this error and recreating the new dataset if the shadow model wasn't created.\r\n\r\nI'm only updating the hook where we're currently seeing errors. There's potentially more that we can do on this after more monitoring. \r\n\r\nTESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nDifficult to reproduce in order to test manually, but I recreated the situation in unit tests.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated

SUMMARY\r\nAdding DuckDB as a datasource, as it's SQLAlchemy dialect appears to have matured a good deal\r\nhttps://github.com/Mause/duckdb_engine/pull/219\r\nTo be clear, this is @alitrack's hard work, not mine, just opening up a PR to keep momentum, and working on testing it myself.  Haven't set up for local dev on superset before, so might take me a few days.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<img width=\"516\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-03-22 at 3 22 53 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/253435/159569623-423fcbf5-d9bb-4f8e-931b-739909ad1b11.png\">\r\n<img width=\"503\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-03-22 at 3 23 10 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/253435/159569964-f458cfa5-d955-4ca5-8a27-2edd3a17d986.png\">\r\n<img width=\"1108\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-03-22 at 3 23 42 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/253435/159569974-2f62da8a-18c3-4fbb-ac16-13da04e12652.png\">\r\nAlmost works!  Stuck on this error - I think the issue is the implementation of `do_ping()` in the duckdb dialect needs to be tweaked a bit, but struggling to get a local duckdb_engine working.  \r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n- ensure you have `duckdb_engine` installed: `$ pip install duckdb-engine`\r\n- should appear in the add database dropdown\r\n- \r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!---

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nPresto (and thus Trino) have specific `TIME` and `TIMESTAMP` types which support time zones. If the underlying column type is `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE` then the `PrestoEngineSpec.convert_dttm` method would incorrectly format the Python `datatime` as a SQL string literal as opposed to casting it to a `TIMESTAMP`.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nAdded unit tests and conformed in Presto:\r\n\r\n1. That the `from_iso8601_timestamp` UDF supported time zones, i.e., `from_iso8601_timestamp('2022-01-01T01:23:46.600+00:00')`\r\n2. That Presto supported a comparison between a time zone aware and time zone naive (defaulting to the time zone of the database engine) timestamp, i.e., `TIMESTAMP` SELECT TIMESTAMP '2001-08-22 03:04:05.321 America/Los_Angeles' > TIMESTAMP '2001-08-22 03:04:05.321' returned `true` for a Presto server using a UTC-localized time zone.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any

SUMMARY\r\nOn the left panel in the SQL Lab editor, we can select a db, schema & table combination and it will query the schema for us.\r\n\r\n**Initial change**\r\nThis PR updates the UI interaction so that, once a table is selected, is not persisted in that select. The reason being a user can select multiple tables and the schemas are all shown below.\r\n\r\n**After discussions**\r\nThis PR updates the UI interaction so that the table select display all the selected tables, as opposed to clearing it.\r\nNow, both the table select & the table list below are linked together bidirectionally and in sync.\r\n\r\nThe select is closed after each selection, considering that most of the time the user will want to pick a single table to work on (interaction up for debate).\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17252075/159029456-cbef8e12-acdd-411e-9605-a70db46619c1.mov\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17252075/160209928-35466d0a-68de-40c7-925d-783b34d50ca0.mov\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Go to SQL Lab\r\n2. Select a DB\r\n3. Select a Schema\r\n4. Select tables\r\n\r\nEnsure after each table selection, the schema appears below (it appears at the end, so you might need to scroll)\r\nEnsure the select contains all the selected tables, and that both the select. & list have the same tables.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [x] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible\r\n  - [ ] Confirm DB migration upgrade and downgrade tested\r\n  - [ ] Runtime estimates and downtime expectations provided\r\n- [ ] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or API\r\n","created_at":"2022-03-18T15:12:18Z","updated_at":"2024-03-13T17:38:30Z","closed_at":"2022-04-13T14:42:12Z","merged_at":"2022-04-13T14:42:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"26a0f0575931850f81a593785d29232f40fd7d71","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"michael-s-molina","id":70410625,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDEwNjI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70410625?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-s-molina","html_url":"https://github.com/michael-s-molina","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-s-molina/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-s-molina/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-s-molina/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-s-molina/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-s-molina/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-s-molina/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-s-molina/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-s-molina/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-s-molina/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1331560260,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzMxNTYwMjYw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/size/L","name":"size/L","color":"6D53B9","default":false,"description":""},{"id":3927051516,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAlosUs7qEgz8","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/Preset-Patch","name":"Preset-Patch","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":6577531558,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAlosUs8AAAABiA0qpg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/%F0%9F%9A%A2%202.0.0","name":"üö¢

SUMMARY\r\n[Sqlalchemy-drill has been updated](https://github.com/JohnOmernik/sqlalchemy-drill/pull/74) to support impersonation with the\r\ndrill+sadrill driver, where previously it did not.  The way that callers\r\nshould specify impersonation matches that for the drill+jdbc driver in that\r\na SA URL parameter of impersonation_target should be set to the username\r\nof the user to be impersonated, while the standard SA username and password\r\nshould be those of the proxy user.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nConfigure a new Apache Drill connection using the drill+sadrill driver from\r\nsqlalchemy-drill.  Enable impersonation and trigger the execution of a Drill\r\nquery.  In the Drill query profile history, confirm that the query was executed\r\nas the impersonated user.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature

we try to add a new chart, we can see only 200 charts in chart list section. Because we are fetching charts by limitation of amount of 200. \r\n\r\nAnd `filtering chart`, `sort by` option only works in frontend, not against database. So we can't see old charts if we have more than 200 charts in database. \r\n\r\n#### Solution.\r\nNeed to make `filter/sort by` option work against database.\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n\r\n1. Go to one dashboard page.\r\n2. Click edit\r\n3. Go go `charts` tab in crud pane.\r\n4. Try to filter chart or sort chart.\r\n\r\nResult: You should be able to see that it hits the endpoint, reloads charts data again.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes

SUMMARY\r\nThe `TabState` model has foreign key constraints on it that are not properly handled when the referred rows are deleted.\r\nThis causes, for instance, that a database fails to be deleted if the user has an SQL Lab editor opened with a query referencing that database.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a database migration with `ondelete` instructions to properly handle cascading deletes when needed.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Team member A previously has a SQL editor tab with DB1\r\n2. Team member B (or same user might work as well) try to delete DB1\r\n3. When prompted, confirm the deletion\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [x] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [x] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible\r\n  - [x] Confirm DB migration upgrade and downgrade tested\r\n  - [x] Runtime estimates and downtime expectations provided\r\n- [ ] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or API\r\n\r\n### Runtime estimates results

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nRLS only works for basic case. The chart/data api allows several controls (ad-hoc metrics, ad-hoc filters) where users can write any SQL in these fields, including subqueries. Any subqueries, or nested subqueries, do not currently have RLS rules applied to them and thus can leak data users shouldn‚Äôt have access to.\r\n\r\nThis PR allows most of ad-hoc sql but reject adhoc contains subqueries or nested subqueries.  It is using helper #19055. The feature flag `ALLOW_ADHOC_SUBQUERY` is set to False by default. \r\nWe will have a follow up implementation to add RLS rules to subqueries and nested subqueries. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nSuperset recently switched to docusaurus, which allows for versioned documentation. This creates the superstructure for that shift. \r\n\r\nIn order to create this new structure, I used the documentation here: https://docusaurus.io/docs/versioning\r\n\r\nThe new file structure is: \r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2022-03-17 at 1 59 53 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48933336/158866349-50bd85fb-1d06-4ae4-8ebb-de2679d1b5a3.png)\r\n\r\nWhere versioned_docs will house the docs for 1.4.0 (and subsequent revisions). The new file versions.json is an array with all the possible versions in it. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\n1. Due to incorrect import of fonts in `src/assets/stylesheets/less/fonts.less`, in fact only the fonts with normal font weight were available. That means that font weights other than 400 simply didn't work - weights from 200 to 500 were rendered as 400, bold font weights were extrapolated by the browser. This PR fixes that issue by explicitely importing font files with weights 200, 400, 500 and 600.\r\n2. After the change described above, font-weight 700 (bold) was too thick. I replaced all 700 weights with 600, so that all texts look similar to how they looked before.\r\n3. HTML tags `<h1-6>`, `<th>` and `<strong>` all use `font-weight: 700` by default. I've overriden them globally to use `font-weight: 600`.\r\n4. I changed the value of bold font weight in `supersetTheme` from 700 to 600, because of the reasons described above.\r\n5. I replaced hardcoded font weights in many components with superset theme variables. Only a few font weights in some plugins css files remain hardcoded.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nThe changes affect the whole product - everything should look as it did before (if you compare side-by-side with current look, there are slight differences in how bold texts look - that's because we didn't actually use Inter font's bold version before).\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nCurrently, If a chart applied Adhoc Column and it was a legacy chart without QueryContext in slice metadata, user will see an error on Dashboard: `TypeError: unhashable type: 'dict'`.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n###

SUMMARY\r\nAdd custom `Flask-Caching` backend that leverages the new `key_value` table that was introduced in #19078. This makes it possible to use the metadata database as a cache. Superset defaults to the new cache for *required* caches that have not been defined in the configs. This is to reintroduce support for multi-pod deployments that don't have a dedicated cache.\r\n\r\nThe cache implements all cache methods that are used in the application (`add`, `set`, `get`, `has`, `delete`), and can be used as a caching backend for any purpose. For instance, to use it to store chart data, the following can be added to `superset_config.py`:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nDATA_CACHE_CONFIG = {\r\n    \"CACHE_TYPE\": \"SupersetMetastoreCache\",\r\n    \"CACHE_KEY_PREFIX\": \"superset_results\", \r\n    \"CACHE_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT\": 86400,\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn addition, Explore form data/Dashboard filter state caches in the ephemeral environments are currently failing on master - after this gets merged they should now work as intended, as they'll use this cache.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nWe are currently dual writing any updates/additions of the SqlaTable to the new Dataset models. We found some errors during update where the new dataset should also be updated, but it doesn't exist. I'm not sure if the dataset wasn't created because when the migration to backfill was run a new SqlaTable was created and we missed it, or we're missing it somewhere else. But for now, I'm catching this error and recreating the new dataset if the shadow model wasn't created. \r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nDifficult to reproduce in order to test manually, but I recreated the situation in unit tests. \r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue

SUMMARY\r\nWhen the SQL Lab has the persistence enabled on the backend (`SQLLAB_BACKEND_PERSISTENCE`), the queries failed on delete in two cases:\r\n\r\n* From the Query History tab, if the query was the last executed.\r\n* From the Saved queries, if the query was the last executed in a tab.\r\n\r\nThe issue is rooted in the `TabState` table, which has a foreign key to the saved query and to the latest executed one.\r\nSo, we need to clear that relation before deleting the query.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n#### Query

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new flag `export_related` to the export commands (databases, datasets, charts, dashboards, saved queries). Usually, when a dataset is exported it will also export its database; when a dashboard is exported, the export will also contain associated charts, datasets, and databases; and so on. When the flag is changed from its default value of `True` then only the asset itself will be exported, without any associated assets.\r\n\r\nThis PR is in preparation for creating a command that will export all assets from a given Superset workspace, allowing us to move the configuration to source control.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis PR bumps major versions on the following main packages:\r\n\r\n**Celery from 4.X to 5.X:**\r\n\r\nBreaking changes: https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/history/whatsnew-5.0.html#step-5-upgrade-to-celery-5-0\r\n\r\nRelevant CLI breaking changes, and a final \"warning\" to migrate configuration keys to the new standard introduced on celery 4:\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/configuration.html#conf-old-settings-map\r\n \r\nNote: Celery is at 5.2.2 and not 5.2.3 because of https://github.com/celery/celery/pull/7194 this can cause problems on newer OSes forcing setup's to pin down setuptools\r\n\r\n**Flask-AppBuilder 3.X to 4.X**\r\n\r\n- Drops python 3.6 support\r\n- Removed config key `AUTH_STRICT_RESPONSE_CODES`, it's always strict now\r\n- Removes `Flask-OpenID` dependency (extra dependency now)\r\n- Major version bump on the packages bellow\r\n\r\n**Flask from 1.X to 2.X**\r\n\r\nBreaking changes: https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/changes/#version-2-0-0\r\n\r\nRelevant:\r\n\r\n- JSON support no longer uses simplejson. To use another JSON module, override app.json_encoder and json_decoder. [#3555](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/3555)\r\n\r\n- [send_file()](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/api/#flask.send_file) raises a [ValueError](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ValueError) when passed an [io](https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html#module-io) object in text mode. Previously, it would respond with 200 OK and an empty file. [#3358](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/3358)\r\n\r\nNo relevant changes for our users, unless using a customised/extended Superset.\r\n\r\n**flask-jwt-extended 3.X to 4.X:**\r\n\r\nBreaking changes:  https://flask-jwt-extended.readthedocs.io/en/stable/v4_upgrade_guide/\r\n\r\nNo relevant changes for our users, unless using a customised Security Manager that uses this extension JWT claims or using `JWT_CSRF_HEADER_NAME` configuration key.\r\n\r\n**pyJWT  1.X to 2.X:**\r\n\r\nBreaking changes:  https://pyjwt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v2-0-0\r\n\r\nNo relevant changes for our users, unless using a customised/extended Superset.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!
