introduced a shim to\r\nenable CouchDB to be compiled to use the Erlang MD5 function.\r\nThis allows CouchDB to run in FIPS environments where the crypto\r\nmodule is restricted such that `crypto:hash(md5,..)` is blocked\r\n(fails with `notsup` error).\r\n\r\nThis commit replaces usage of `crypto:hash(md5, ..)` introduced since\r\nthe original PR with the shim function.\r\n\r\n<!--

Thank you for your contribution!\r\n\r\n     Please file this form by replacing the Markdown comments\r\n     with your text.

Positive feedback is represented +1 from committers\r\n     and negative is a -1. The -1 also means veto, and needs to be addressed\r\n     to proceed.

Overview\r\n\r\nThis adds the auto-compaction daemon directly into the main repo. It also adds the \"Support scheduling compactions during time windows\" enhancement and related unit tests that were added to couchdb-smoosh after the 1.0.1 tag.\r\n\r\nWe use git-subtree to carry the smoosh history forward, with an invocation like\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit subtree add --prefix=src/smoosh https://github.com/apache/couchdb-smoosh.git master\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nCheck that the codebase is the same as you would get by moving the \"smoosh\" tag in rebar to \"master\".\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [ ] Changes are covered by tests\r\n- [ ] Any new configurable parameters are documented in `rel/overlay/etc/default.ini`\r\n- [ ] A PR for documentation changes has been made in

Overview\r\n\r\nThis PR removes all bits and pieces of view_changes from mrview, couch_changes and fabric applications, removes `/_view_changes` end-point and removes seq, kseq and log btrees from mrview file structure. Migration code for 1.2 views was modified to support transparent migration from 2.x views.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nAll the tests should pass. Sinice this is removing functionality tests for which been disabled anyway, it's hard to validate it otherwise.\r\n\r\nAdditional manual testing could be done with creation of views on CouchDB 2.x with `seq_indexed` and / or `keyseq_indexed` options set and then accessing them on this CouchDB version. Here is [a setup I've used for testing](https://gist.github.com/eiri/1e5ba550f5dbd271b0b7d03d65e66414), it could help to get up to speed with that. \r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull

Thank you for your contribution!\r\n\r\n     Please file this form by replacing the Markdown comments\r\n     with your text. If a section needs no action - remove it.\r\n\r\n     Also remember, that CouchDB uses the Review-Then-Commit (RTC) model\r\n     of code collaboration. Positive feedback is represented +1 from committers\r\n     and negative is a -1. The -1 also means veto, and needs to be addressed\r\n     to proceed. Once there are no objections, the PR can be merged by a\r\n     CouchDB committer.\r\n\r\n     See: http://couchdb.apache.org/bylaws.html#decisions for more info. -->\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\n<!-- Please give a short brief for the pull request,\r\n     what problem it solves or how it makes things better. -->\r\nThis fix is to refactor the logic for soft-deletion of search index. In the past, there is case where write.lock was stayed in search index directory and can't be moved. It is due to the fact that the index was not closed gracefully before moving/renaming search index. With this fix, the search index writer can be closed, and then search index can be moved to .deleted directory smoothly.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe how we can test your changes.\r\n     Does it provides any behaviour that the end users\r\n     could notice? -->\r\n```\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\n T E S T

Overview\r\n\r\nPreviously with require_valid_user=true configured a user would need to supply Basic auth credentials in order to login via the _session endpoint (or have some otgher Catch-22 way of using an existing session). This patch makes it so that any attempt to POST to _session is allowed to proceed.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nTry to POST to `_session` with `require_valid_user = true` and don't supply any additional basic auth header. Without this patch you would get rejected.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\nCloses #1947.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [x] Changes are

membership check was disabled when fetching the security doc.

Those functions however call\r\n`get_security/1` before doing the actual check, and in some cases, like when\r\nchecking for admin, the failure was coming from the membership check in\r\n`get_security/1` instead. Also some tests were going through the regular\r\nrequest path of opening a new db by name. In order, make the tests more\r\nuniform, switch all the tests to apply the tested `UserCtx` in the open

Overview\r\n\r\nWe have been failing to honor Range requests that specify an ending byte less than the final byte of an attachment. The code that was supposed to truncate the binary to the desired length was actually executing a noop statement that preserved the entire binary.\r\n\r\nMany HTTP clients will ignore the extra bytes on the wire and so this bug has gone undetected for a long time. Newer releases of libcurl that disable HTTP/0.9 support do detect it, and so we implicitly have a test for this in attachment_ranges.js, but ideally we'd have a more explicit one at some point in the future.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nWithout this patch the attachment_ranges test fails when using libcurl version 7.66 or higher.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\nFixes #2244\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [x] Changes are covered by tests\r\n- [ ] Any new configurable parameters are documented in `rel/overlay/etc/default.ini`\r\n- [ ] A PR for documentation changes has been made in

Overview\r\n\r\nThis PR implements opentracing support. It mostly implements [RFC-011](https://github.com/apache/couchdb-documentation/blob/master/rfcs/011-opentracing.md).\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n0. Run test suite \r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ make eunit apps=ctrace\r\n```\r\n\r\n1. Write connection string into fdb.cluster file\r\n2. Start FDB server\r\n3. Update rel/overlay/etc/default.ini similar to this:\r\n\r\n```ini\r\n[tracing]\r\nenabled = true\r\nthrift_format = compact ; compact | binary\r\nagent_host = 127.0.0.1\r\nagent_port = 6831\r\napp_name = couchdb\r\n\r\n[tracing.filters]\r\n; Log all traces\r\nall = (#{}) -> true\r\n; Disable tracing POST requests to `/dbname`\r\ndatabase-info.read = (#{'http.method' := Method}) when Method == 'POST' -> false\r\n; Log 50% of all view builds\r\nview.build = (#{}) -> 0.5\r\n```\r\n4. Start jaeger `docker run -d -p 6831:6831/udp   -p 16686:16686   jaegertracing/all-in-one:1.14`\r\n5. Start couchdb `dev/run --admin=adm:pass`\r\n6. Create database `curl -X PUT -u adm:pass http://127.0.0.1:15984/test`\r\n7. Query database `curl -X GET -u adm:pass http://127.0.0.1:15984/test`\r\n8. Open http://localhost:16686/ in the browser and search for spans\r\n\r\nAs an alternative to Step 4, you can run the `jaeger-all-in-one` binary without arguments in a separate shell. The Jaeger project provides prebuilt binaries for download.\r\n\r\nTo generate a bunch of spans for investigation you can also run `make elixir`.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\nThis PR is a replacement PR for https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/2286\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [x] Changes are covered by tests\r\n- [x] Any new configurable parameters are documented in `rel/overlay/etc/default.ini`\r\n- [ ] A PR for documentation changes has been made in https://github.com/apache/couchdb-documentation\r\n","created_at":"2019-11-12T16:46:10Z","updated_at":"2019-11-20T22:59:00Z","closed_at":"2019-11-20T22:58:57Z","merged_at":"2019-11-20T22:58:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"4680884b1d232d1f3159d1222b63e4e30bfffc25","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/2309/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/2309/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/2309/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/b4f8b4ffad412f0fa0739044d4f29be49261382f","head":{"label":"cloudant:opentracing-pd","ref":"opentracing-pd","sha":"b4f8b4ffad412f0fa0739044d4f29be49261382f","user":{"login":"cloudant","id":44642,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ0NjQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant","html_url":"https://github.com/cloudant","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":39005786,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTAwNTc4Ng==","name":"couchdb","full_name":"cloudant/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloudant","id":44642,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ0NjQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant","html_url":"https://github.com/cloudant","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloudant/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloudant/couchdb","description":"Mirror

Overview\r\n\r\nImplementation of suggestion from https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/1977 to set up single node automatically when `[couchdb] standalone=true` is set.\r\n\r\nI hope I found a proper place to implement it.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nI found no fully automatic tests for `setup` module so I updated prepared manual test script and updated `dev/run` script to facilitate testing.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\nFixes #1977\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [x] Changes are covered by tests\r\n- [x] Any

Overview\r\n\r\nPreviously `_scheduled/docs` returned detailed replication statistics for\r\ncompleted jobs only. To get the same level of details from a running or pending\r\njobs users had to use `_active_tasks`, which is not optimal and required jumping\r\nbetween monitoring endpoints.\r\n\r\n`info` field was originally meant to hold these statistics but they were not\r\nimplemented and it just returned `null` as a placeholder. With work for 3.0\r\nfinalizing, this might be a good time to add this improvement to avoid\r\ndisturbing the API afterwards.\r\n\r\nJust updating the `_scheduler/docs` was not quite enough since, replications\r\nstarted from the `_replicate` endpoint would not be visible there and users\r\nwould still have to access `_active_tasks` to get inspect them, so let's add\r\nthe `info` field to the `_scheduler/jobs` as well.\r\n\r\nAfter this update, all states and status details from `_active_tasks` and\r\n`_replicator` docs should be available under `_scheduler/jobs` and\r\n`_scheduler/docs` endpoints.\r\n\r\n### Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n   1. Run couch_replicator eunit tests\r\n\r\n(edit: unit test added for the test below as well)\r\n  ~~2. Create a few replications and monitor _scheduler/jobs and _scheduler/docs~~\r\n  ~~3. Make those jobs pending by lowering the max_jobs to 0~~\r\n   ~~4. Inspect _scheduler/jobs and docs. Stats should still be showing even when the jobs are pending.~~\r\n  ~~5. Delete the max_jobs setting and wait for jobs to start running against. They should keep their stats and update them when new docs are replicated over.~~\r\n\r\n### Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\n<!-- If your changes affects multiple components in different\r\n

Overview\r\n\r\nSince we now have separate proxies for source and target, show them in `_scheduler/docs` endpoint as separate as well. Previously we just read the proxy value from the source.\r\n\r\nWhen formatting the proxy url for output, make sure `socks5` schema is handled\r\nby the url credentials stripping code to avoid exposing user credentials.\r\n\r\n### Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n   `make eunit apps=couch_replicator suites=couch_replicator_scheduler`\r\n\r\nStart a replication with source and/or target proxies defined, then call _scheduler/docs and inspect the output.\r\n\r\n### Related Issues or Pull

Overview\r\n\r\nPreviously if a proxy was specified it was used for both source and target\r\ntraffic. However, as mentioned in #2272, since both source and target now are\r\nURLs, instead of one being a \"local\" database, it makes sense to allow separate\r\nproxy settings for source and target endpoints.\r\n\r\nWe are still allowing an old style, single proxy setting. However, if users set\r\nboth the old style proxy and a per-endpoint one, an exception is raised about\r\nthe settings being mutually exclusive.\r\n\r\nFixes #2272\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [x] Changes are covered by tests\r\n- [ ] A PR for documentation changes has been made in (will make a separate PR after this one is

Overview\r\n\r\nSince the db structure returned from fabric2_db:open and fabric2_db:create\r\nincludes `user_ctx` there is no need to pass it explicitly\r\nin every `fabric2_db` call. This means we can simplify few things:\r\n\r\n- Don't pass user_ctx in `chttpd_db:db_req/2` since we pass db already\r\n- Don't have to use `db_open_options` in `chttpd_changes`\r\n- Don't have to pass `user_ctx` to `fabric2_db:open_doc` and `fabric2_db:update_doc`\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n```\r\nmake eunit apps=fabric\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull

Overview\r\n\r\nThe history of `send_error(_Req, {already_sent, Resp, _Error})`\r\nclause is bellow:\r\n\r\n- it was added on [2009/04/18](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc/couchdb/trunk/src/couchdb/couch_httpd.erl?r1=762574&r2=765819&diff_format=h)\r\n- we triggered that clause [in couch_httpd:do](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc/couchdb/trunk/src/couchdb/couch_httpd.erl?revision=642432&view=markup#l88)\r\n- at that time we were using inets webserver [see use of `httpd_response/3`](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc/couchdb/trunk/src/couchdb/couch_httpd.erl?revision=642432&view=markup#l170)\r\n- The inets OTP codebase uses `already_sent` messages [here](https://github.com/erlang/otp/blob/50214f02501926fee6ec286efa68a57a47c2e531/lib/inets/src/http_server/httpd_response.erl#L220)\r\n\r\nIt should be safe to remove this clause because we are not using inets anymore\r\nand search of `already_sent` term across all dependencies doesn't return any results.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\ntest suite should be sufficient\r\n\r\n## Related

Overview\r\n\r\nThe history of `send_error(_Req, {already_sent, Resp, _Error})`\r\nclause is bellow:\r\n\r\n- it was added on

couch_httpd:do](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc/couchdb/trunk/src/couchdb/couch_httpd.erl?revision=642432&view=markup#l88)\r\n- at that time we were using inets webserver [see use of `httpd_response/3`](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc/couchdb/trunk/src/couchdb/couch_httpd.erl?revision=642432&view=markup#l170)\r\n- The inets OTP codebase uses `already_sent` messages [here](https://github.com/erlang/otp/blob/50214f02501926fee6ec286efa68a57a47c2e531/lib/inets/src/http_server/httpd_response.erl#L220)\r\n\r\nIt should be safe to remove this clause because we are not using inets anymore\r\nand search of `already_sent` term across all dependencies doesn't return any results.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nStandard test suite run should be sufficient\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [ ] Changes are covered by tests\r\n- [ ] Any new configurable parameters

Overview\r\n\r\nUsing a negative heartbeat value does not return a 400 bad request, instead getting just an empty response with no status code at all.\r\n\r\nThis commit adds extra checks so that

better advantage of metadata version key feature\r\n\r\nIssue https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/2224\r\n\r\nFDB's metadata version key allows more efficient metadata invalidation\r\n(see apple/foundationdb#1213). To take advantage of\r\nthat feature update the caching logic to check the metadata version first, and\r\nif it is current, skip checking the db version altogether.\r\n\r\nWhen db version is bumped we now update the metadata version as well.\r\n\r\nThere is a bit of a subtlety when the metadata version is stale. In that case\r\nwe check the db version, and if that is current, we still don't reopen the\r\ndatabase, instead we continue with the transaction. Then, after the transaction\r\nsucceeds, we update the cached metadata version for that db handle. Next client\r\nwould get the updated db metadata, it will be current, and they won't need to\r\ncheck the db version. If the db version is stale as well, then we throw a\r\n`reopen` exception and the handle gets removed from the cache and reopened.\r\n\r\nNote: this commit doesn't actually use the new metadata version key, it still\r\nuses the old plain key. That update will be a separate commit where we also start\r\nsetting a new API version (610) and will only work on FDB version 6.1.x\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-17T21:43:58Z","updated_at":"2020-07-13T14:33:15Z","closed_at":"2019-10-18T19:25:33Z","merged_at":"2019-10-18T19:25:33Z","merge_commit_sha":"f3d572caf112598d12d705f98dffb8cdbb2bec97","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/2261/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/2261/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/2261/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/a082748348cbe3f6a664cb1fdb9abf57cfc3458a","head":{"label":"apache:check-metadata-first","ref":"check-metadata-first","sha":"a082748348cbe3f6a664cb1fdb9abf57cfc3458a","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206417,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0MTc=","name":"couchdb","full_name":"apache/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb","description":"Seamless

Overview\r\n\r\nDelayed commits option is removed\r\n\r\nThis effectively removes a lot `couch_db:ensure_full_commit/1,2` calls.\r\n\r\nHowever`/ _ensure_full_commit` HTTP API was left as is since replicator from older versions of CouchDB would call that, it just returns the start time as if ensure_commit function was called.\r\n\r\nIssue: https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/2165\r\n\r\n##

Overview\r\n\r\nThe reason we don't do this in `config:features()` directly is because this one is a dynamic check for the presence of a connected clouseau node. Calling `enable_feature` every time we conduct that check seemed too heavyweight, but I didn't see a good opportunity to just call it once and be confident that it would reliably advertise the feature.\r\n\r\nThe downside here is that CouchDB will not advertise the \"search\" feature if Clouseau is disconnected for maintenance or whatever, although technically it's accurate since search requests submitted during that interval would fail.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nWire up CouchDB with Clouseau and see if \"search\" shows up in the list of features.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\n#2205 \r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [ ] Changes are covered by tests\r\n- [ ] Any new configurable parameters are documented

Overview\r\n\r\nSimilar to 448be7996999a706464d8f7429a56dc9e9c87c3a (hello 0.10.1),\r\n`timer:{send,apply}_interval()` will apply functions / send messages\r\nfor all intervals that match the time that a machine was in sleep /\r\nhibernation mode that is common on desktop systems.\r\n\r\nIn a typical office scneario, a laptop system that sleeps over a\r\nweekend , when woken up on a monday, issue thousands of function\r\ncalls, that together with other, unrelated wake-up activity, make\r\na machine top out its CPU for no good reason.\r\n\r\nThe change addresses this by instead of relying on an interval to\r\nstart a given task, on startup, start the task once after a timeout,\r\nand then start a fresh timer after the task is done.\r\n\r\nOther than the 0.10-era patch, this one does not account for a system\r\nwaking up before the timeout. I’m happy to add that behaviour, if a\r\nreviewer insists on it.\r\n\r\nAs a result, no matter how long the sleep period is, we only run\r\nthe desired function _once_ after we wake up again. In the never-\r\nsleep scenario, the existing behaviour is retained.\r\n\r\nThis might impact metrics that have a time component, but I think\r\nthat’s a fair compromise, so I didn’t investigate that further.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nStart CouchDB on a system that supports sleep or hibernation, have CPU instrumentation set up for the CouchDB process, and observe CPU load after prolonged sleep times.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, add a couch_log:info() line to the interval’d functions and see log entries for each Interval during the sleep period, but with a wake-up-time era

Overview\r\n\r\nSometimes there is a need to specify additional arguments for the beam process we start from dev/run.\r\nIn particular the feature is handy for:\r\n- changing emulator flags\r\n- simulate OOM via available RAM restrictions\r\n- enable module loading tracing\r\n- configure number of schedulers\r\n- modify applications configuration\r\n- run customization script to add extra development deps (such as automatic code reload)\r\n\r\nHistorically developers had to edit dev/run to do it.\r\nThis PR adds an ability to specify additional arguments via `--extra_args` argument.\r\n\r\nIn order to run customization script create `customization.erl` which exports `start/0` and run it using:\r\n```\r\ndev/run --extra_args='-run customization'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is cherry-pick from master\r\n```\r\ngit cherry-pick dd5ac138ecbdee76ff3ba68664f25c2a5cdda7cc\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n- this is a cherry-pick of a commit from master\r\n\r\n##

Overview\r\n\r\nSometimes there is a need to specify additional arguments for the beam process we start from dev/run.\r\nIn particular the feature is handy for:\r\n- changing emulator flags\r\n- simulate OOM via available RAM restrictions\r\n- enable module loading tracing\r\n- configure number of schedulers\r\n- modify applications configuration\r\n- run customization script to add extra development deps (such as automatic code reload)\r\n\r\nHistorically developers had to edit dev/run to do it.\r\nThis PR adds an ability to specify additional arguments via `--extra_args` argument.\r\n\r\nIn order to run customization script create `customization.erl` which exports `start/0` and run it using:\r\n```\r\ndev/run --extra_args='-run customization'\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n1. Create `dev/customization.erl` with the following content:\r\n    ```\r\n    -module(customization).\r\n\r\n    -export([start/0]).\r\n\r\n    start() ->\r\n\t  error_logger:info_msg(\"CUSTOMIZATION!!!~n\").\r\n    ```\r\n2. run `dev/run --extra_args='-run customization'`\r\n3. check logs and verify there is a line similar to the following\r\n    ```\r\n    [info] 2019-09-10T12:17:00.828103Z node1@127.0.0.1 <0.5.0> -------- CUSTOMIZATION!!!\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\n<!-- If your changes affects multiple components in different\r\n     repositories please put links to those issues or pull requests here.  -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [ ] Changes are covered by tests\r\n- [ ] Any new configurable parameters are documented in `rel/overlay/etc/default.ini`\r\n- [ ] A PR for documentation changes has been made in

Master would return the count if had it available\r\neasily and having it seems like a useful thing and an improvement.\r\n\r\nTo test:\r\n```\r\nmake elixir tests=test/elixir/test/basics_test.exs\r\n```","created_at":"2019-09-05T20:27:36Z","updated_at":"2019-09-06T14:01:42Z","closed_at":"2019-09-06T14:00:22Z","merged_at":"2019-09-06T14:00:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"198306c1ae09fd677cc382325bc700e5a57b33f5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/2175/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/2175/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/2175/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/0b62f85faa59f03ac5d5248477fbf06e38389e3f","head":{"label":"apache:prototype/fdb-layer-fix-update-seq-for-local-docs","ref":"prototype/fdb-layer-fix-update-seq-for-local-docs","sha":"0b62f85faa59f03ac5d5248477fbf06e38389e3f","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206417,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0MTc=","name":"couchdb","full_name":"apache/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb","description":"Seamless
