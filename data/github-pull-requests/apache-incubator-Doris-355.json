Proposed changes\r\n\r\nThe return type of str_to_date depends on whether the time part is included in the format.\r\nIf included, it is DATETIME, otherwise it is DATE.\r\nIf the format parameter is not constant, the return type will be DATETIME.\r\nThe above judgment has been completed in the FE query planning stage,\r\nso here we directly set the value type to the return type set in the query plan.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\nA table with one column k1 varchar, and has 2 lines:\r\n    \"%Y-%m-%d\"\r\n    \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%i:%s\"\r\nQuery:\r\n    SELECT str_to_date(\"2020-09-01\", k1) from

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nThe rows deleted by `delete operation` will not be deleted from the disk untill base compaction for the relevant tablet is performed. The data deleted logically not only occupies disk space, but also has an effects on scan performance. So it is necessary to perform compaction task for the tablet that contains a lot of deleted rows. \r\n\r\nFor a tablet, we can record the filtered rows during scan operation since last base compaction, and take the filtered rows as a consideration factor when selecting a tablet for compaction task.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [x] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nCurrently when a scan node scans many tablets, Doris will assure it load balance when choosing which replica for scan task to be executed. But it does not take other scan nodes into consideration to implement a global load balance.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nWhen a parquet file contains a `Map/List/Struct` structure, Doris can not recognize the column correctly, and throws exception 'Invalid column: xxxx', that means Doris can not find the column.

on 2020-11-30:\r\nReplaced by calculating variance based on Decimal as intermediate variable, this is a more elegant way. See below for details.\r\nThe first trick method of cast to double before can be seen: https://github.com/xinyiZzz/incubator-doris/commit/1f172482b87167cede1b6dc4ca0b2e4c880a40a1\r\n——————————————————————————————————————————\r\n## Proposed changes\r\n\r\nBy cast Decimal to Double, realize the variance calculation of Decimal type column.\r\nIn my local Spark2.4 and Mysql, the variance of Decimal is also calculated by cast to Double.\r\nNOTE: There may be two parts of precision loss:\r\n- Decimal cast to Double\r\n- In the variance calculation process, the precision of the Double type intermediate variable is lost (the effective number of digits of Double is 16)\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have create an issue on (Fix #3127), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [x] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nBefore fix the variance calculation by Decimal cast to Double, I implemented a method of directly calculating the variance on Decimal, using DecimalV2Value as the type of intermediate variable. see Commit: https://github.com/xinyiZzz/incubator-doris/commit/0288a6f76245bdf1f6eb0b54d3f5921414772066\r\n\r\nCompared with cast to Double, the considerations and advantages of calculating variance directly based on Decimal:\r\n- Less loss of precision.\r\n- Faster performance.\r\n- Consistent with other functions, such as `avg()`, `sum()`, etc., these functions use Decimal to calculate directly in Doris, and use DecimalV2Value as the type of intermediate variable.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is an overflow problem in calculating variance based on Decimal. When `Variance> 9223372036854775807999999999/N` (9223372036854775807999999999 is the maximum value of DecimalV2Value, N is the number of data rows), the intermediate variable in the calculation process will overflow and return a maximum value.\r\n\r\nI feel that theoretical business requirements will not calculate the variance greater than `9223372036854775807999999999/N`, so cast to Double means lower accuracy and worse performance, but both Spark and Mysql use cast to double methods, so I Pull this code.\r\n\r\n#### precision comparison:\r\n- When the first 16 bits of the data are the same, such as `12345678901234560` and `12345678901234561`, at this time, the result calculated by cast to double is 0 (loss of precision), and the correct result by direct calculation by Decimal is 0.5\r\n- When the variance result is large, compared to the result after cast to double `42981942961.912369`, the result directly calculated by Decimal `42981942961.913988699` is more accurate\r\n\r\n#### Performance comparison:\r\nThe test results of variance/stddev and other functions are as follows:\r\n- Cast to Double calculation: 0.054s\r\n- Decimal direct calculation: 0.034s\r\n\r\nTable building method:\r\n```\r\nCREATE TABLE stddev_samp_test29\r\n(event_day int, money DECIMAL(27,9) DEFAULT \"0\")\r\nDISTRIBUTED BY HASH(event_day) BUCKETS 5\r\nPROPERTIES(\"replication_num\" = \"1\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nData with 10w rows of equal length, such as `99.00066`, is generated by:\r\n```\r\nf = open('data.txt','w')\r\nn = 100000\r\nwhile (n):\r\n f.write('0,' + \"%.5f\"% (99 + random.random()) +'\\n')\r\n n -= 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt’s too important to complete the preliminary research, so

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nWhen a user tries to load parquet file into Doris, like this path: `hdfs://hadoop/user/data/date=20201024/*`, but acturally the path contains some none parquet files，the error is throwed ` Couldn't deserialize thrift: No more data to read.\\\\nDeserializing page header failed.`. If the error message includes the file name information, we can quickly locate the errors. Therefore, this patch try to add the file name to the error message.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nThis CL mainly changes:\r\n\r\n1. Avoid repeated sending of common components in Fragments\r\n\r\n    In the previous implementation, a query may generate multiple Fragments,\r\nthese Fragments contain some common information, such as DescriptorTable.\r\nFragment will be sent to BE in a certain order, so these public information will be sent repeatedly\r\nand generated repeatedly on the BE side.\r\n\r\n    In some complex SQL, these public information may be very large,\r\nthereby increasing the execution time of Fragment.\r\n\r\n    So I improved this. For multiple Fragments sent to the same BE, only the first Fragment will carry\r\nthese public information, and it will be cached on the BE side, and subsequent Fragments\r\nno longer need to carry this information.\r\n\r\n    In the local test, the execution time of some complex SQL can be reduced from 3 seconds to 1 second.\r\n\r\n2. Add the time-consuming part of FE logic in Profile\r\n\r\n    Including SQL analysis, planning, Fragment scheduling and sending on the FE side, and the time to fetch data.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [x] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have create an issue on (Fix #4656), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nThe query planner is still time-consuming when processing complex SQL. It will be optimized later.\r\n","created_at":"2020-11-15T10:20:55Z","updated_at":"2020-11-22T12:38:06Z","closed_at":"2020-11-22T12:38:06Z","merged_at":"2020-11-22T12:38:06Z","merge_commit_sha":"f1b57c4418e5cdf399a6d73214f5992c2e9ecce7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":665965628,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2NjU5NjU2Mjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/kind/improvement","name":"kind/improvement","color":"84b6eb","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1705186861,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzA1MTg2ODYx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/area/sql/execution","name":"area/sql/execution","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":"Issues

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIn colocate join, the memory limit of each instance is usually less than the value of `exec_mem_limit`, which could lead to query failure (Memory exceed limit).\r\nSince the purpose of resetting colocate-join memory limit (`/fe/fe-core/src/main/java/org/apache/doris/qe/Coordinator.java`) is unclear to me, I just change the default value of `query_colocate_join_memory_limit_penalty_factor` from `8` to `1`, as a hotfix.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have create an issue on (Fix #4894 ), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [] If this change need a document change, I have updated the document\r\n- [] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n","created_at":"2020-11-13T07:59:41Z","updated_at":"2020-11-16T13:57:01Z","closed_at":"2020-11-16T13:57:01Z","merged_at":"2020-11-16T13:57:01Z","merge_commit_sha":"55080ba8883327338685a001a3da4563a29f2653","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2039763841,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDM5NzYzODQx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/approved","name":"approved","color":"00ff00","default":false,"description":"Indicates

Proposed changes\r\n\r\n1. Add metrics to `used permits` and `waitting permits` for compaction. It would be useful to monitor `permits` hold by all executing compaction tasks and waitting compaction task.\r\n\r\n2. Add log which can be chosen by config  for merge rowsets.  It would be helpful to track the process of rowsets merging for compaction task which lasts for a long time.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [x] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nThe current compaction mechanism is that there is a producer thread that has been producing compaction tasks, and the selected tablet must apply for `permits`. When a tablet could hold `permits`, compaction task for this tablet will be submitted to  thread pool. We take compaction score as `permits` which is used for limiting memory consumption. However,  `pick_rowset_to_compaction()` will be executed before the file merge in compaction thread, and the number of segment files that actually perform the merge operation is smaller than compaction score. In addition, it is also possible that compaction task exits directly because the tablet doesn't meet the requirements of compaction. \r\n\r\nThis patch optimizes and refactors the code of compaction, so that we can execute 'pick rowsets' before applying for permits for a compaction task, calculate the number of segment files that actually participate in the merge operation, and take this number as `permits`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [x] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nThis CL mainly changes:\r\n\r\n1. Send and execute Fragments in batch\r\n\r\n    In the previous implementation, a SQL execution plan may generate multiple Fragments.\r\nEven if these Fragments are sent to the same BE node, they are sent separately in multiple RPCs.\r\nThese Fragments will have some common information, such as DescriptorTable, QueryGlobals, etc.\r\nSending one by one through RPC will repeatedly DeSer these information, resulting in unnecessary overhead.\r\n\r\n    After the modification, the Coordinator merges multiple Fragments of same BE and sends them in one RPC,\r\nand extracts common information to avoid multiple repeated DeSer operations. At the same time,\r\nthe Fragment execution part on the BE side is modified, multiple Fragments are executed in one request,\r\nand the common structure is avoided constructing repeatedly.\r\n\r\n    In the local single-node test, a SQL which generates 300 fragments, the execution time is reduced from\r\n7 seconds to 2 seconds. The main reduction part is the receiving and executing Fragment part on the BE side.\r\nThe remaining time is mainly spent on query planning on the FE side, which will be improved in next PR.\r\n\r\n2. Add the time-consuming part of FE logic in Profile\r\n\r\n    Including SQL analysis, planning, Fragment scheduling and sending on the FE side, and the time to fetch data.\r\n\r\n3. Add a FE config to switch on/off this feature\r\n\r\n    Add a temp config `enable_batch_fragment_execution` to switch on/off this \"batch execution\" feature.\r\nIn case that some bugs happen after online. This CL has pass our Daily Test. And I test it with 100 concurrency by\r\n`jmeter`, both on and off, it works well and the performance remain the same(For small query, the performance is expected).\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [x] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have create an issue on (Fix #4656), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nThe query planner is still time-consuming when processing complex SQL. It will be optimized later.\r\n","created_at":"2020-11-12T11:07:38Z","updated_at":"2020-11-14T07:59:35Z","closed_at":"2020-11-14T07:59:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7e9d5961f7f660293f323c24363b7f0149b6a4a2","assignee":{"login":"morningman","id":2899462,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTk0NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2899462?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman","html_url":"https://github.com/morningman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"morningman","id":2899462,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTk0NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2899462?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman","html_url":"https://github.com/morningman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":665965628,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2NjU5NjU2Mjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/kind/improvement","name":"kind/improvement","color":"84b6eb","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1705186861,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzA1MTg2ODYx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/area/sql/execution","name":"area/sql/execution","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":"Issues

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nMany time, our users want to use UDFs they developed to ETL the data when loading the data into Doris.But currently, `broker load` does not support to use UDF. As UDF belongs to a database, it needs to check whether it has the `SELECT` permission of the database. This patch try to solve this problem. \r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [] I have create an issue on (Fix #ISSUE), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [x] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [x] If this change need a document change, I have updated the document\r\n- [x] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at dev@doris.apache.org by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n","created_at":"2020-11-07T13:36:43Z","updated_at":"2020-11-18T13:52:00Z","closed_at":"2020-11-18T13:52:00Z","merged_at":"2020-11-18T13:52:00Z","merge_commit_sha":"ec9da30c9cad4d552907b83e0b80029918939468","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1099563192,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDk5NTYzMTky","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/kind/feature","name":"kind/feature","color":"c7def8","default":false,"description":"Categorizes

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nA large  number of small segment files will lead to low efficiency for scan operations. Multiple small files can be merged into a large file by compaction operation. So we could take the tablet scan frequency into consideration when selecting an tablet for compaction and preferentially do compaction for those tablets which are scanned frequently during a latest period of time at the present.\r\n\r\nUsing the compaction strategy of `Kudu`for reference, `scan frequency` can be calculated for tablet during a latest period of time and be taken into consideration when calculating compaction score.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nmainly includes:\r\n- `OLAP_SCAN_NODE` profile layering: `OLAP_SCAN_NODE`,`OlapScanner`, and `SegmentIterator`.\r\n- Delete meaningless statistical values. mainly in scan_node.cpp.\r\n- Increase `RowsConditionsFiltered` statistical, split from `RowsDelFiltered`, the meaning is the number of rows filtered by various column indexes, only in segment V2.\r\n- Modify the document based on the above, and enhance readability.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [x] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [x] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have create an issue on (Fix #4821 ), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [x] If this change need a document
