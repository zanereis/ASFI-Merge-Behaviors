Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1252\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nCurrently, Gobblin service flows have no Flow level SLA enabled by default. This task sets the default flow SLA for each flow orchestrated by GaaS. In addition, this PR also exposes a service level configuration key to control the default flow concurrency behavior. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nEnhanced existing unit tests.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1251\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nContext: this feature is improving fault tolerance in Gobblin-on-YARN. \r\n\r\n`registerNewTask` called in `org.apache.gobblin.runtime.GobblinMultiTaskAttempt#runWorkUnits(org.apache.gobblin.runtime.CountUpAndDownLatch)` would swallow the exception if scheduling failed before this change. Post the change, the exception-handling logic within `runWorkunits` will handle it and retry if necessary. \r\n\r\nAlso did some comment-enhancement and variable renaming which doesn't break atomicity for this PR since they are relevant.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\ntested in the internal YARN cluster and verified the exception being propagated. Also passed newly added unit test.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1248\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n**Why this PR?**\r\nPreviously in streaming pipeline, to avoid race condition on metadata schema, when we do hive registration, we always fetch the latest schema from Kafka SchemaRegistry, since gobblin converter may change the schema, this introduce discrepancy between hive table schema and real file schema, so we need a better way to solve this problem\r\n**Solution**\r\nWe leverage the schema creation time in the schema fetched from schema registry adn keep that information when converter the schema. If the schema creation time of writer's schema is the same as latest schema, we will update the table schema to the writer's schema, else we will keep the schema same as existing table's schema\r\n**What's the change**\r\nBy default there is no change, to leverage this feature, the pipeline must be configured to use schema registry V2 to fetch schema which contains information about schema creation time.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nRun streaming pipeline to test hive can works well\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Several things to note: \r\n- This writer supports Union write. \r\n- There's an optimization being added for throughput, to handle nested wide schema inside write by calling `ensureSize` with more-than-needed size in advance. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1241\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n1. Allow data nodes/edges to optionally use .conf files for HOCON format instead of only java format\r\n2. Delay resolution of data nodes/edges to allow overriding, but temporarily resolve config when constructing data nodes to allow for example passing fs.uri validation check\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nTested GaaS locally with .conf files and overriding\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2020-08-17T23:15:12Z","updated_at":"2020-08-18T21:16:07Z","closed_at":"2020-08-18T21:16:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e218eaf1d6c131681a77d2de58a8bd70a3863fbb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3083/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3083/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3083/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/bf4a1c4bb4498f67c9c32e31012d9e17e2f174ea","head":{"label":"jack-moseley:data-node-resolve","ref":"data-node-resolve","sha":"bf4a1c4bb4498f67c9c32e31012d9e17e2f174ea","user":{"login":"jack-moseley","id":7660222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NjAyMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7660222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley","html_url":"https://github.com/jack-moseley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":67752782,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2Nzc1Mjc4Mg==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"jack-moseley/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jack-moseley","id":7660222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NjAyMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7660222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley","html_url":"https://github.com/jack-moseley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jack-moseley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jack-moseley/gobblin","description":"Universal

LinkedIn has used this framework to address the huge variety challenge in data integration with external data sources. \r\n\r\nHTTP data sources are the top beneficiary of this framework, including Rest API, OData, and SOAP based data sources. S3 and GCS (Google Cloud Storage) data sources can also benefit from it in small data volumes that are less than 10TB, without using SDK. \r\n\r\nWe have also verified the HTTP Multistage connector can greatly simplify data ingestion from Salesforce.com. However, this PR doesn't included the necessary component, CSV Extractor, yet. \r\n\r\nThis PR includes following functionalities:\r\n\t- This PR contains a separate multistage module that works with HTTP data sources\r\n\t- It supports HTTP GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE operations\r\n\t- It supports nested JSON format\r\n\t- It supports Rest API calls and its derived OData service\r\n\t- It supports following ways of pagination\r\n\t\t○ By offset and page size\r\n\t\t○ By page number\r\n\t\t○ By a total record count\r\n\t\t○ By signal of an empty response\r\n\t\t○ By next page URL\r\n\t\t○ By a cursor or next page locator\r\n\t- It supports session state control as a mechanism of pagination or asynchronous requests\r\n\t- It supports pulling files from GCS or S3 via HTTP requests\r\n\t- It supports field project, including nested field projection, based on a given schema\r\n\r\nSample applications of this module will be added in read docs. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nmultistage.configuration.MultistagePropertiesTest.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1234\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nThe JobHistoryStore unit tests fail on local build after the MySQL v8 bump up due to change in default settings for the system variable explicit_defaults_for_timestamp. This results in a change in how timestamp columns with NULL values are handled. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nFixed failing unit tests after v8 bump up. So verified existing unit tests in DatabaseJobHistoryStoreTest.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1231\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n**What does this PR do?**\r\nThis pr make the re-compaction be able to write to a new folder. If recompaction.write.to.new.folder is set to be true, then output if compaction will be /daily/yyyy/mm/dd/compaction_{executionCount} instead of /daily/yyyy/mm/dd. \r\n**Why this PR needed**\r\nIn iceberg world, we should not delete file in a dataset directly, so re-compaction should not delete the old daily data, instead it should write to a new folder\r\n**If there is change for existing pipeline**\r\nFor existing pipeline, there will be no change as the _recompaction.write.to.new.folder_ is not enabled by default\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nRun compaction test \r\nUnit test, also run re-compaction on AZ job to make sure hive registration works well\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

small fixes\r\n\r\nDear Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. \r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1233\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR:\r\n - `WhitelistBlacklist` today is case agnostic. The PR adds an option to make it case sensitive\r\n - Fix Bug: [GOBBLIN-831](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-831). On zero work unit, `KafkaWorkUnitPacker` will trigger NPE\r\n - Fix Bug: `DatasetCleanerTask` doesn't set working state on task failure or succeess\r\n - Improvement: Allow `AsyncHttpWriter` to retry on any transmission exception besides IOException\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests:\r\n - `WhitelistBlacklistTest.testCaseAware()` covers case sensitive support. The other tests verifies that the change is backward compatible\r\n - `KafkaWorkUnitPackerTest.testPackEmptyWorkUnit()` verifies no NPE given 0 work units\r\n - `AsyncHttpWriterTest.testClientError()` verifies retries are done on RuntimeException other than IOException.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1277\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nThe CopyDataPublisher uses HadoopUtils.renameRecursively() to publish the staged data to the root path \"/\". HadoopUtils.renameRecursively() will check for the existence of the target directory and its parent directory and call mkdirs to create missing directories if the parent directory does not exist.\r\n\r\nThis check may return an AccessDeniedException if permissions are limited on the parent directory.\r\n\r\nFor directories, treat the AccessDeniedException as an indicator of existence to allow the recursive renaming to proceed in this scenario.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\ntestRenameRecursivelyWithAccessDeniedOnExistenceCheck\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2020-08-06T20:18:02Z","updated_at":"2020-08-06T22:21:40Z","closed_at":"2020-08-06T22:21:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"20a639c18b1deafc15d2f05369c0a474ff2d9fa5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3073/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3073/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3073/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/116efc515d98f4312c6d59d525320aaca69fe11c","head":{"label":"htran1:rename_access_denied","ref":"rename_access_denied","sha":"116efc515d98f4312c6d59d525320aaca69fe11c","user":{"login":"htran1","id":23297947,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjk3OTQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23297947?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1","html_url":"https://github.com/htran1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":73107999,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3MzEwNzk5OQ==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"htran1/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"htran1","id":23297947,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjk3OTQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23297947?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1","html_url":"https://github.com/htran1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/htran1/gobblin","description":"Universal

JIRA\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1226\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nLombok is a cool tool (although IMHO not worth it's troubles, considering generated code is harder to debug, incompatibilities in bytecode, line version mismatch in debugger, etc, etc) which promises to have zero runtime dependencies.\r\n\r\nIt is also strongly advised by its developers that it should be present on the classpath only during compilation/code generation and not at all, during runtime. (I don't have an exact reference at hand but it can be searched in the lombok google forum).\r\n\r\nLombok in runtime's classpath is considered not only a bad practice but wrong usage of lombok. \r\n\r\nThe issue it caused me was that it brings an older version of guava into path.\r\n\r\nI propose the `compile ...lombok` in `build.gradle` be changed to `compileOnly`. This has zero effects on any current project using gobblin.\r\n","created_at":"2020-08-06T10:43:08Z","updated_at":"2020-08-18T19:48:35Z","closed_at":"2020-08-18T19:48:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"aadcc48651c30127957c28381ca497f59ea31d04","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3072/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3072/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3072/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/05946ccd6ba4dba6465c24bd6d5bc86618086f03","head":{"label":"hkoosha:master","ref":"master","sha":"05946ccd6ba4dba6465c24bd6d5bc86618086f03","user":{"login":"hkoosha","id":63921250,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzOTIxMjUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63921250?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hkoosha","html_url":"https://github.com/hkoosha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hkoosha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hkoosha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hkoosha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hkoosha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hkoosha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hkoosha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hkoosha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hkoosha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hkoosha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"be46c7c34ad4576f15d2cb08037c672bf17a8bd3","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":27392543,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzM5MjU0Mw==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"apache/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below! @jack-moseley  @sv2000  please review\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1219\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nTrigger listener (GobblinServiceJobScheduler) on slave instance too, so that a flow is compiled even when submitted to slave. But, do not schedule flow spec from slave instance of GobblinServiceJobScheduler to avoid double scheduling.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nmanually tested\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1214\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nBefore this change, when a user-specified shuffle-key is not eligible ( e.g. the field in the shuffle doesn't exist in the data schema), the fallback is not working properly as the OrcKeyComparator is still using the shuffle-key specified in jobConfigurator. It ends up with failure in deserialization from byteArray into in-memory ORC row-object. \r\n\r\nThis change makes the detection of eligibility happen in the driver level, so that within `OrcValueMapper` the fallback of shuffleKey is transparent. \r\n\r\nAdded a unit test for that which would be failing before.\r\n\r\nAlso rename the `mrOutputSchema` to `mrInputSchema` for the accuracy. This indeed breaks the atomicity of this commit but it is overall relevant. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1213\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nSince the failing task is designed to throw an exception immediately on run(), the job state de-serialization in the parent class (i.e. SingleTask) can be skipped to avoid instantiation failures. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nExisting unit tests.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1212\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nBefore this change, the handling for non-primitive types like map,array and union will hit NPE since they don't have `fieldNames`. This fixed that and making sure the eligibility check happens recursively into those types.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1211\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nThe AMRMClient processes container allocation events asynchronously in a separate thread. If there are multiple concurrent container requests and consequent callbacks, we need to ensure that updates to shared data structures such as the set of unused Helix instance names are consistent and thread-safe. In other words, any updates to this set made by one thread will be visible to all other threads handling the container allocation events. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nExisting tests.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1209\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nThis PR allows the tmp dir to be set to the container's cache location overriding the default setting of /tmp. This requires the the tmp dir system property to dynamically configured to the cache location.  \r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nExisting unit tests.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

But, this PR adds the option to have a staging directory which is being created within datasets.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\nMy PR incorporates change to the following unit tests:\r\nFileAwareInputStreamDataWriterTest.java\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1200\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nCurrently when using local throttling for distcp, the first call to limiter asks for 0 permits which throws an error. It probably makes more sense for asking for 0 permits to just return and do nothing instead of throwing an error.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nTested distcp job\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

by Gobblin Application Master\r\n\r\nDear Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1191\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nCurrently, when containers are released by Gobblin Application Master, the Helix instance names are not released back to the pool of unused instance names. The effect of this is that the number of unique Helix instances keeps growing over time. Since Helix creates one znode per instance, this can result in the number of znodes to grow unboundedly. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1189\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nThe increasing latency check in KafkaIngestionHealthCheck checks for the latency to be strictly increasing i.e current latency > previous latency. This task relaxes the condition to: current latency >= previous latency. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nModified existing unit test.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

This is particularly sseful in scenarios where pipeline monitoring depends on metrics and tracking events being emitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nUnit tests\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1181\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n'org.apache.parquet:parquet-protobuf:1.10.1' is not resolvable from MavenCentral because it's missing some of its transitive dependencies. This will cause 'gobblin-apache-parquet' module also not be resolvable from Central (in the future, when it will be published to Central). To fix this, I suggest using 'compileOnly'. This will ensure that 'gobblin-parquet-apache' is cleanly resolvable from Central.\r\n\r\nThis change unblocks automated consumption of gobblin external artifact at LinkedIn\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nTested by running the build and inspecting the pom files\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2020-06-04T04:09:14Z","updated_at":"2020-06-04T18:49:24Z","closed_at":"2020-06-04T18:49:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f0e48285ab495981b52e2e94a660b6e0ee06b809","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3028/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3028/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3028/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/5e8aede6973a9511c51c70f82ffc03f629e0cc31","head":{"label":"vikrambohra:skipParquetProto","ref":"skipParquetProto","sha":"5e8aede6973a9511c51c70f82ffc03f629e0cc31","user":{"login":"vikrambohra","id":24703997,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzAzOTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24703997?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikrambohra","html_url":"https://github.com/vikrambohra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikrambohra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikrambohra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikrambohra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikrambohra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikrambohra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikrambohra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikrambohra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikrambohra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikrambohra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":177204474,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzcyMDQ0NzQ=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"vikrambohra/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vikrambohra","id":24703997,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzAzOTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24703997?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikrambohra","html_url":"https://github.com/vikrambohra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikrambohra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikrambohra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikrambohra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikrambohra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikrambohra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikrambohra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikrambohra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikrambohra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikrambohra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vikrambohra/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Since we heavily rely on Helix to retry/reassign the task when failure happened, we need to make sure that even the task creation failure will be properly propagated. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nIt has been tested in the internal YARN container for the relevant changes. \r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1177\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nOver-provisioning config can be used to spin up a fleet of spare containers to allow Helix to reassign tasks to away from unhealthy containers (e.g. containers that experience persistent task failures due to N/W issues) to the potentially healthy spare containers. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1173\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nCurrently, any exception in the finally block inside getWorkUnits() method will prevent the original exception from being propagated, thus making it hard to root cause the original issue. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nTrivial change.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1162\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nIn execution environments such as Gobblin-on-Yarn, where Gobblin workers can be re-assigned when the worker dies or is killed, it is useful to add a mode where each Gobblin task running inside a Gobblin worker can perform application-level health checks and report results of the health checks back to the worker hosting the tasks. The worker on receiving a health check failure event can be configured to exit the JVM. In the case of Gobblin-on-Yarn mode, this will result in the worker getting re-assigned to a different node. The proposed behavior is similar in flavor to speculative execution modes provided in other execution frameworks such as MapReduce. \r\n\r\nThis change also provides an example of such an application-level health check that arises in the case of Kafka ingestion. In addition, this PR adds an EventBusFactory as an implementation of SharedResourcesBrokerFactory that allows communication between different components of GobblinTaskRunner via a shared EventBus instance.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nAdded unit tests:\r\n1.EventBusFactoryTest\r\n2. GobblinTaskRunnerTest\r\n3. KafkaIngestionHealthCheckTest\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.
