goal here is to reduce the number of active database sessions on the metadata database. Note that sqla create database connection pools and that when we have thousands of tasks emitting heartbeats it can lead to way too many connections, ultimately maxing out on the MySQL side. #1002 describes the issue.\n\nThis PR includes:\n- A refactor where `Session` and `engine` sqla objects live in `airflow` instead of `airflow.settings` (those objects really aren't settings, they're just widely used objects)\n- Some `airflow.utils` functions to set a NullPool engine in place of the QueuePool engine\n- call for `airflow run` to use the NullPool\n- Fixing the unit tests to run with LocalExecutor (had to disable the timeout

@mistercrunch \n## What? Why?\n\nI was running an airflow job that executes a number of presto queries.  The first bunch succeeded, and then the job suddenly died with this error:\n\n```\n    records = presto.get_records(my_hql)\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/airflow/hooks/presto_hook.py\", line 50, in get_records\n    obj = eval(str(e))\n  File \"<string>\", line 1\n    Unexpected status code 503\n                    ^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n```\n\nWhat happened here is that presto was temporarily unavailable (a \"hiccup\") so it returned a 503 error.  Our error-handling code expected the response to be `eval()`'able, which is true in most cases but not in the 503 case.  With 503's, the message is just \"Unexpected status code 503\".  You can't eval() that.\n\nWe discussed this offline.  We both agree that `eval()` is just a bad thing to do.  You suggested using `json.loads` instead.  I tried that and found that `str(e)` is not valid json.  Instead, it's python-hash formatted.  For example, it has `u` prefixes for all the strings.\n\nSo I chose to take a different approach.  I simply check for the values I expect to find (a la duck-typing).  If they exist, I extract them and use them in the PrestoError.  If not, I just str() the whole error.\n## How was it tested?\n\nI executed an invalid query (\"blah blah select...\") and verified that we handle that error.  Here's what I saw:\n\n```\nPrestoException: SYNTAX_ERROR: line 1:1: no viable alternative at input 'blah'\n```\n\nFor the other case, rather than taking down presto, I simulated this by manually setting the error object to the string \"Unexpected status code 503\".  Here's what I saw:\n\n```\nPrestoException: Unexpected status code 503\n```\n\nI'm brand new to airflow development so let me know if there are other/better ways to verify my

trying to use the check_operator with BigQuery, I discovered that we need PEP 249 support for BigQuery in order to make it work. I've added PEP 249 support for BQ, and added a BigQuery check operator.\n\nThis patch looks large, but is mostly just cruft. The core BigQuery run methods remain basically untouched.\n\nI have validated that these changes work with our DAGs. I also validated the Data Profiler queries. I'm still unaware of anyone else using this stuff. There is one backwards incompatible change--I moved the run methods for BQ into the

bash commands when regex is passed in for backfills during dry runs\n\nThis is to address https://github.com/airbnb/airflow/issues/972\n\nLooking at the code, it looks like the \"deepcopy\" of BaseOperator excluded params and user-defined-macros from being copied. I suspect this is to protect the user from providing very deeply nested params that would cause the deepcopy to fail -- hence, the idea may have been to keep the user of airflow (i.e. an author of an airflow DAG) from shooting himself/herself in the foot. Unfortunately, a deep copy was being used for the task regex feature in backfills. When dry-run was specified, a bash command would need to be rendered to show the user the potential bash command that would be run. Unfortunately, without a param map, this is not possible. \n\nI have taken the arguably controversial path of allowing deep copies of the param map for task instances.\n\nI'm open to a less generic solution that also gets us the ability to conduct dry runs with task regex matching.

in Progress**: Creating PR to get feedback on feature\n\nCurrently, the only way to get an updated graph is to refresh the entire page. \nThis PR adds a button that on the UI that remove the need to refresh the entire page. \n\n**Questions:**\nShould we have the UI automatically poll the server for update rather then a manual click?\nIf not, what is the best place to place the button?\nWhich other view should we expand this feature to first?(ex. gantt, tree, etc...)\n\n**Use Case:**\n1. Open dag graph view\n2. Run a task\n3. Click refresh button and the border colors will be updated to fail/running/succeeded without having to refresh the entire page\n\n<img width=\"437\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-01-31 at 4 14 57 pm\"

model columns used datetime.now() as a default argument.  According to the sqlalchemy docs, http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/core/defaults.html, when using datetime, you want to pass the function itself without parens (see quote below).\n\nAdditionally, elsewhere in models.py, the convention is to use func.now().  This SO comment, http://stackoverflow.com/a/33532154/1812329, leads me to believe this is probably best practice, so I changed the 3 instances where datetime.now() is passed as default into func.now() calls.  \n\nfrom sqlalchemy docs:\n\n> Note that when using func functions, unlike when using Python datetime functions we do call the function, i.e. with parenthesis “()” - this is because what we want in this case is the return value of the function, which is the SQL expression construct that will be rendered into the INSERT or UPDATE statement.\n","created_at":"2016-01-25T02:50:03Z","updated_at":"2016-05-04T19:41:12Z","closed_at":"2016-01-25T02:58:02Z","merged_at":"2016-01-25T02:58:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"a421245e56837282965317712cfd3cb9dbf7497f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/906/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/906/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/906/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/c5a7b2a3aff43ef23368ae31a105add112c76ece","head":{"label":"t1m0thy:master","ref":"master","sha":"c5a7b2a3aff43ef23368ae31a105add112c76ece","user":{"login":"t1m0thy","id":2903129,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MDMxMjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2903129?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/t1m0thy","html_url":"https://github.com/t1m0thy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t1m0thy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t1m0thy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t1m0thy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t1m0thy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t1m0thy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t1m0thy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t1m0thy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t1m0thy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t1m0thy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":50143839,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MDE0MzgzOQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"t1m0thy/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"t1m0thy","id":2903129,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MDMxMjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2903129?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/t1m0thy","html_url":"https://github.com/t1m0thy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t1m0thy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t1m0thy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t1m0thy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t1m0thy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t1m0thy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t1m0thy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t1m0thy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t1m0thy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t1m0thy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/t1m0thy/airflow","description":"Airflow

is in response to https://github.com/airbnb/airflow/issues/873\n\nEssentially, I would like to add a callback function to SLA miss handling. In the callback function, I can decide whether to post to Slack and to VictorOps/PagerDuty, or some other 3rd party ops solution. Email is too limiting. \n\nI've added another column to the table to track SLA notifications in general. Not in this PR is a fix for a general problem which can occur is SLAs were enabled on a task but no emails or sla alert call back were provided. In this case, the query to return all SLA misses would progressively return more and more data, slowing down the Scheduler. We need a separate fix to place a window on the max number of sla misses
