https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/42857\r\n\r\nAs discussed https://lists.apache.org/thread/dyv5jhvt65xs6l5o2byc2b67f4wlwf6r, this is the first part of the new layout.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is only a partial split so far. It moves all the code and tests, but the provider release generation code hasn't moved yet as it's a few weeks until the next batch, and I wan't to try and keep this already huge PR as small as possible. Likewise the creation of `core/` will be a follow on PR\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to the straight file rename the other changes I had to make here are:\r\n- Some mypy/typing fixes.\r\n\r\n  Mypy can be fragile about what it picks up when, so maybe some of those\r\n  changes were caused by that. But the typing changes aren't large.\r\n\r\n- Improve typing in common.sql type stub\r\n\r\n  Again, likely a mypy file oddity, but the types should be safe\r\n\r\n- Removed the `check-providers-init-file-missing` check\r\n\r\n  This isn't needed now that airflow/providers shouldn't exist at all in the\r\n  main tree.\r\n\r\n- Create a \"dev.tests_common\" package that contains helper files and common\r\n  pytest fixtures\r\n\r\n  Since the provider tests are no longer under tests/ they don't automatically\r\n  share the fixtures from the parent `tests/conftest.py` so they needed\r\n  extracted.\r\n\r\n  Ditto for `tests.test_utils` -- they can't be easily imported in provider\r\n  tests anymore, so they are moved to a more explicit shared location.\r\n\r\nIn future we should switch how the CI image is built to make better use of UV caching than our own approach as that would remvoe a lot of custom code.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

#42132\r\n- The `await_xcom_sidecar_container_start` method in `PodManager` checks if the xcom sidecar container has started running before executing `do_xcom_push`.\r\n- The function logs the status periodically and raises an `AirflowException` if the container does not start within the specified timeout.\r\n- Added two unit tests:\r\n  - `test_await_xcom_sidecar_container_timeout`: Verifies that an `AirflowException` is raised if the sidecar container fails to start within the timeout.\r\n  - `test_await_xcom_sidecar_container_starts`: Confirms the method successfully exits when the sidecar container starts.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

CLI command to setup identity center could only setup part of the required resources, since adding an application must be done from the console. As of November 15, 2023 it is now required to have an AWS Organization setup to create the required type of Identity Center Instance. The script would have to be change majorly to achieve this but it is also something that should be done with great care and intention since creating an organization in your AWS account has implications. If we automate it, many users won't know it's being created. Instead have users run through the wizard provided in the AWS console.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

An internal method named ``_get_blob`` is created in ``GCSHook`` to consolidate ``bucket.get_blob`` calls where it includes validation.

All,\r\n\r\nDo company polices we can not store secrets in the `values.yaml` and we need to use Kubernetes Secrets. These requirements made the PgBouncer implementation ver challenging because the the helm chart is able to handle external database until it is fully defined in the `values.yaml` however if it is defined the Kubernetes Secret than the PgBouncer does not pick up these changes and wan't to connect to the local Postgres DB which is not deployed because external database was used.\r\n\r\nTo be able to PgBouncer work we need to create two Kubernetes Secrets manually and reference is in the chart.  \r\n\r\nI have extended the helm documentation if someone else in the future can have countless hours on

mentioned in https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/42343#discussion_r1774261268\r\n\r\nWe don't really *need* those objects in the database after the manager (simply in the memory-managed SQLAlchemy session is good enough), and since the objects are still transaction-held, they can't be accessed by the listener hooks even if they are in the database anyway.\r\n\r\nI also took the oppertunity to turn all listener method to class methods instead. This doesn't really make any difference (the manager does not hold instance-level values), and we need at least some of the methods to be class-level (for the internal API), and it's more consistent to have them all be class-level.","created_at":"2024-09-25T01:57:18Z","updated_at":"2024-09-25T11:47:40Z","closed_at":"2024-09-25T11:47:38Z","merged_at":"2024-09-25T11:47:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"f2775bf9f1062e71d1f7796cde4da92018c6b57a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ephraimbuddy","id":4122866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjI4NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4122866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy","html_url":"https://github.com/ephraimbuddy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"pierrejeambrun","id":14861206,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODYxMjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14861206?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun","html_url":"https://github.com/pierrejeambrun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":nu

Have just added the SSL/TLS flags to the debug control flow. `fastapi` cli does not have SSL flags, but it is a thin wrapper around `uvicorn.run` (https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi-cli/blob/main/src/fastapi_cli/cli.py#L92)\r\n\r\nHave created the `Appendable` test utility to declare files/filepaths in `pytest.mark.parametrize` that are to be relative `tmp_path`. Lmk if it is a bit weird / not good. Or whether it should be separated out into a different PR.\r\n\r\n~~There are some CI failures, not too sure atm if it is because of `uvicorn[standard]>=0.15.0` or flakiness. Between [fa4239a](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/42443/commits/fa4239ae2f05eb3f8174f53b978e86e1a5536094) and [ba2fec5](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/42443/commits/ba2fec52381296abec57d00537cce8f50d5fd08d) same checks did not fail (barring mypy). Other PRs that trigger the same checks seem to sometimes error too (though error message is a bit different).~~ Atm, the only failing CI check looks to be resolved as a part of #42500.\r\n~~`fastapi[standard]>=0.112.2` itself requires `uvicorn[standard]>=0.15.0`, wondering though whether since `uvicorn` is no longer a transitive dependency the tests fail.~~\r\n\r\nrelated:

matches the ignore file behavior of many popular tools (e.g. Git, Docker) and is likely what most users expect without reading the documentation.\r\n\r\nThe documentation is also tweaked to emphasize the new default. I also decided to get rid of some regexp examples entirely; I figure most of the users are better off either using glob, or just customize the might_contain_dag_callable hook instead. The regexp syntax parser uses re2, which is quite limiting for security reasons, and does not offer significant advantages over glob for almost all use cases.","created_at":"2024-09-24T08:28:46Z","updated_at":"2024-09-30T04:43:46Z","closed_at":"2024-09-30T04:43:44Z","merged_at":"2024-09-30T04:43:44Z","merge_commit_sha":"2eecca17fc00fc6cd501380049db61decde0beb8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1993586993,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTkzNTg2OTkz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/kind:documentation","name":"kind:documentation","color":"1ED98E","default":false,"description":""},{"id":7208027571,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAgUK288AAAABraHFsw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/airflow3.0:candidate","name":"airflow3.0:candidate","color":"C85C47","default":false,"description":"Potential

[this](https://github.com/apache/airflow/actions/runs/10989610037/job/30508389976) failing CI job, the test has failed due to `opensearch-py` being set to None, which means there's an import failure.\r\n\r\nThe import failure is due to the removal of `opensearch-py` package during the build process:

simple auth manager as default auth manager. Updating the default auth manager can confuse Airflow developers because the login form and the way users are defined change. Therefore, I'll merge this PR after consulting the community (dev email list or other).\r\n\r\nBut changing the default auth manager to simple auth manager allows detecting tests in Airflow core that rely on FAB auth manager (I have seen quite many). So I'll use this PR to update the tests in Airflow to no longer rely on FAB auth manager.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

The functions now use `run_id` as the sole identifier for DAG runs, simplifying the process and eliminating deprecated behaviour.\r\n\r\n### **Motivation**:\r\nIn Airflow, `execution_date` has historically been used to distinguish different DAG run instances. However, the introduction of `run_id` and the DAG run concept in Airflow 2.2 shifts away from using `execution_date` as an identifier. Continuing to rely on `execution_date` introduces limitations, such as the inability to handle multiple DAG runs at the same logical time, especially in cases like `TriggerDagRunOperator` when dynamic runs are generated.\r\n\r\nThis PR eliminates these limitations by removing `execution_date`and `logical_date` in favor of `run_id`. \r\n\r\n### **Key Changes**:\r\n1. **API and Function Changes**:\r\n   - [x] The `logical_date` arguments have been removed from all public APIs and Python functions related to DAG run lookups.\r\n   - [x] `run_id` is now the exclusive identifier for DAG runs in these contexts.\r\n\r\n2. **Database Migration**:\r\n   - [x] The unique constraint on `execution_date` in the database has been dropped, as `run_id` now ensures the uniqueness of DAG runs as part of [#41818](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/41818)\r\n\r\n### **Rationale**:\r\nRemoving `execution_date` is necessary to enable more flexible DAG run management. For example, dynamic runs created by `TriggerDagRunOperator` can now be correctly identified and managed without awkward workarounds as discussed in this [doc](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/AIP-83+Remove+Execution+Date+Unique+Constraint+from+DAG+Run). This change makes subsequent DAG run lookups easier and more robust, while also simplifying the database schema by removing the unique constraint on `execution_date`.\r\n\r\n### **How `execution_date` and `logical_date` Work**\r\n1. **Logical date is equivalent to execution date**: The two are just different names for the same value.\r\n2. **Timetable controls logical date**: The logical date can be set to any value, not necessarily tied to the data interval's start or end.\r\n3. **Schedules dictate behavior**: For value-based schedules (like cron), the logical date is set by the timetable class used.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, users will still be able to view `execution_date` for reference, renamed as `logical_date`, and paired with `run_id` for clarity in the web UI, making it easier to distinguish between DAG runs.\r\n\r\n### **Testing**\r\n- Updated unit tests to reflect the changes.\r\n\r\ncloses: [#42339](https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/42339), [#42340](https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/42340) and [#42338](https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/42338)\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

For long running tasks, in fact, k8s credentials could expire while the task is still running, we are therefore refreshing credentials and retrying. However this did not completely solve the issue due to the `stop_after_attempt(3)`: the job is still failing when credentials were expiring more than twice.\r\n\r\nThis PR attempts at fixing this issue by:\r\n1) removing the `stop_after_attempt` logic\r\n2) still failing the job in case credentials are invalid after refresh. we in fact still want to make sure the job doesn't run forever if it is producing 401s after refresh\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nRead the **[Pull Request
