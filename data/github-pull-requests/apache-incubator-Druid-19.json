Description\r\nFixes a bug with `NestedPathArrayElement` which was missing negative index handling for `Object[]` like it had for `List`. This meant that while a query like `json_query(c1, '$.a_array[-2].a_str')` would work correctly because it would get a `List` from the raw data, something like `json_query(json_query_array(c1, '$.a_array'), '$[-2].a_str')` would fail with an array out of bounds exception because `json_query_array` spits out `Object[]`. This PR fixes the problem so that both are consistent.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths,

For backwards compatibility, this feature is off by default. This allows cluster operators to selectively enable access to LOOKUP, or even disallow completely while still allowing SQL access to LOOKUP resources.\r\nEx: if druid.sql.planner.authorizeLookupDirectly is false, disallow completedly authorization to LOOKUP resource. User can access any LOOKUP resource without permission.\r\nif druid.sql.planner.authorizeLookupDirectly is true, druid will verify the permission of any LOOKUP resource.\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing.

Description\r\nFixes an issue with `ExpressionVirtualColumn` index supplier not correctly handling the case where MVDs are used as arrays in the expression (e.g. MV_OFFSET or any of the other mvd array functions). Added missing `ExpressionSelectors.canMapOverDictionary` check which is similar to what is used by `ExpressionFilter` to handle the same cases. \r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid

Description\r\nFixes an issue when filtering `NestedFieldVirtualColumn` using 'processFromRaw' (e.g. `JSON_QUERY` instead of `JSON_VALUE`) when using partial paths. `NestedFieldVirtualColumn` was incorrectly returning `null` from `getIndexSupplier` in this case instead of `NoIndexesColumnIndexSupplier.getInstance()` to instruct the processing to fall back to using value matchers. Added test case for this, as well as another similar case which was working correctly where it should also fall back to using no-indexes when referring to an array element, to ensure no future regressions.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code

upgradeSegments table contains entries of pending segments allocated by tasks with APPEND locks when there was a REPLACE lock held over the interval.\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to clean the entries from the metadata store after the task with the REPLACE lock completes by invoking a clean up method before unlocking its locks.\r\nSince this is performed on the TaskLockbox directly, rolling upgrades wouldn't be affected and the clean up would happen automatically once the Overlord is upgraded. Also, the task lockbox is aware of the locks held by the task and this can help us avoid unnecessary calls to the metadata store to clean stale entries.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\nFixes some bugs with #15585 involving expression virtual columns which refer to other virtual columns, as well as an issue that can happen during SQL planning when extractionFn is specified for inputs to equality and null filters, but virtualColumnRegistry is null.\r\n\r\nchanges:\r\n* `ColumnIndexSelector` now extends `ColumnSelector`. The only real implementation of `ColumnIndexSelector`, `ColumnSelectorColumnIndexSelector`, already has a `ColumnSelector`, so this isn't very disruptive\r\n* removed `getColumnNames` from `ColumnSelector` since it was not used\r\n* `VirtualColumns` and `VirtualColumn` method `getIndexSupplier` now needs argument of `ColumnIndexSelector` instead of `ColumnSelector`, which allows expression virtual columns to correctly recognize other virtual columns, fixing an issue which would incorrectly handle other virtual columns as non-existent columns instead\r\n* fixed a bug with sql planner incorrectly not using expression filter for equality filters on columns with extractionFn and no virtual column registry\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\nCurrently the \"azure\" input source schema only supports ingesting files that are stored in the Azure Storage Account specified in  `druid.azure.account`. To support ingesting data from different storage accounts, add a new \"azureStorage\" input source schema for azure with a slightly different spec.\r\n\r\n#### Fixed the bug ...\r\n#### Renamed the class ...\r\n#### Added a forbidden-apis entry ...\r\n1. Added AzureStorageAccountInputSource\r\nI would have preferred to keep using the regular AzureInputSource class but that class assumes CloudObjectLocation.bucket to be the container of the file and CloudObjectLocation.path to be the path the file within the bucket. I couldn't think of a way to keep the behavior backwards compatible with existing ingestion specs and support multiple storage accounts.\r\n\r\nOne idea i had was to introduce a \"storageAccount\" field directly in AzureInputSource (instead of in CloudObjectLocation), then use that field when creating AzureStorage classes. I think this would work but it also would mean that the behavior of azure ingestion is different from other types of ingestion (by having the storage account not in the ingestion uri) and this could cause problems down the line.\r\n\r\n2. Create a new AzureStorage instance with a AzureClientFactory with credentials passed in from AzureStorageAccountInputSource.\r\nSince the AzureStorage instance is a abstraction over Azure Blob Storage clients, I thought it made sense to create a instance of it per Azure ingestion spec, since we do something similar with S3 (create a s3 client for each s3 ingestion spec).\r\n\r\nIt would have also been possible to pass the AzureInpuSourceConfig to the relevant functions in AzureStorage and generate different clients but I thought this would have been confusing.\r\n\r\n3. Auth methods\r\nI added support for key, sas token, and app registration authentication when ingesting from storage accounts. Managed/Workload identity auth can also work by not specifying properties and making sure the identity the cluster is deployed with can access the external storage account.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nSupport Azure ingestion from multiple Storage Accounts.\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `AzureStorageAccountInputSource`\r\n * `AzureInpuSourceConfig`\r\n * `AzureClientFactory`\r\n * `AzureStorage`\r\n * `AzureEntity`\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\nfixes some bugs caused by some limitations of the original design of how DruidPredicateFactory interacts with 3-value logic. The primary impacted area was with how filters on values transformed with expressions or extractionFn which turn non-null values into nulls, which were not possible to be modelled with the 'isNullInputUnknown' method\r\n\r\nchanges:\r\n* adds DruidObjectPredicate to specialize string, array, and object based predicates instead of using guava Predicate\r\n* DruidPredicateFactory now uses DruidObjectPredicate\r\n* introduces DruidPredicateMatch enum, which all predicates returned from DruidPredicateFactory now use instead of booleans to indicate match. This means DruidLongPredicate, DruidFloatPredicate, DruidDoublePredicate, and the newly added DruidObjectPredicate apply methods all now return DruidPredicateMatch. This allows matchers and indexes\r\n* isNullInputUnknown has been removed from DruidPredicateFactory\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n_tbd_\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests

two new rules:\r\n\r\n1) ReverseLookupRule, which eliminates calls to LOOKUP by doing\r\n   reverse lookups.\r\n\r\n2) AggregatePullUpLookupRule, which pulls up calls to LOOKUP above\r\n   GROUP BY, when the lookup is injective.\r\n\r\nAdds configs `sqlReverseLookup` and `sqlPullUpLookup` to control whether these rules fire. Both are enabled by default.\r\n\r\nUpdates FilterDecomposeConcatRule and CalciteRulesManager as described in https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/15626#issuecomment-1887989205.\r\n\r\nTo minimize the chance of performance problems due to many keys mapping to the same value, ReverseLookupRule refrains from reversing a lookup if there are more keys than `inSubQueryThreshold`. The rationale for using this setting is that reversal works by generating an IN, and the `inSubQueryThreshold` describes the largest IN the user wants the planner to create.\r\n\r\nWhich LOOKUP calls are reversible can be kind of tricky. The docs include the following table, which helps explains it.\r\n\r\n|SQL|Reversible?|\r\n|---|-----------|\r\n|`LOOKUP(sku, 'sku_to_name') = 'WhizBang Sprocket'`|Yes|\r\n|`LOOKUP(sku, 'sku_to_name')

patch removes BaseScalarUnivariateMacroFunctionExpr, adds BaseMacroFunctionExpr at the top of the hierarchy (a suitable base class for ExprMacros that take either arrays or scalars), and adds an implementation for \"visit\" to BaseMacroFunctionExpr.\r\n\r\nThe effect on implementations is generally cleaner code:\r\n\r\n- Exprs no longer need to implement \"visit\".\r\n- Exprs no longer need to implement \"stringify\", even if they don't use all of their args at runtime, because BaseMacroFunctionExpr has access to even unused args.\r\n- Exprs that accept arrays can extend BaseMacroFunctionExpr and inherit a bunch of useful methods. The only one they need to implement themselves that scalar exprs don't is

was using virtualColumns.getColumnCapabilities, which only returns capabilities for virtual columns, not regular columns. The effect of this is that expression filters (and in some cases, arrayContainsElement filters) would build value matchers rather than use indexes.\r\n\r\nI think this is a performance regression since #12315, which added the getColumnCapabilities method to BitmapIndexSelector, and included the same implementation as exists in the code today.\r\n\r\nThis error is easy to make due to the design of virtualColumns.getColumnCapabilities, so to help avoid it in the future, this patch renames the method to getColumnCapabilitiesWithoutFallback to emphasize that it does not return capabilities for regular columns.","created_at":"2024-01-02T23:30:55Z","updated_at":"2024-01-23T06:47:34Z","closed_at":"2024-01-03T05:09:19Z","merged_at":"2024-01-03T05:09:19Z","merge_commit_sha":"b0e52c99bbc248d54b43e5f06880a4c13be00383","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":120288359,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjAyODgzNTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Performance","name":"Performance","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":648734860,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2NDg3MzQ4NjA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Segment%20Format%20and%20Ser/De","name":"Area

to the reverse-lookup optimization that is part of InDimFilter. As a follow-up to this, I'd like to add the optimization to the SQL planner. But it helps to improve the code before doing that. It has various problems that I think haven't been obvious because the optimization only applies to the `lookup` extractionFn (in core, this is only used for lookups inline with the query), not `registeredLookup` (used for lookups defined with the Coordinator API).\r\n\r\n1) Add a \"mayIncludeUnknown\" parameter to DimFilter#optimize. This is important\r\n   because otherwise the reverse-lookup optimization is done improperly when\r\n   the \"in\" filter appears under a \"not\", and the lookup extractionFn may return\r\n   null for some possible values of the filtered column. The \"includeUnknown\" test\r\n   cases in InDimFilterTest illustrate the difference in behavior.\r\n\r\n2) Enhance InDimFilter#optimizeLookup to handle \"mayIncludeUnknown\", and to be able\r\n   to do a reverse lookup in a wider variety of cases.\r\n\r\n3) Make \"unapply\" protected in LookupExtractor, and move callers to \"unapplyAll\".\r\n   The main reason is that MapLookupExtractor, a common implementation, lacks a\r\n   reverse mapping and therefore does a scan of the map for each call to \"unapply\".\r\n   For performance sake these calls need to be batched.","created_at":"2024-01-02T18:59:57Z","updated_at":"2024-01-29T07:40:55Z","closed_at":"2024-01-03T21:28:45Z","merged_at":"2024-01-03T21:28:45Z","merge_commit_sha":"e40b96e0261cb8354ac04232870b9854c62a8b86","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":648734860,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2NDg3MzQ4NjA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Segment%20Format%20and%20Ser/De","name":"Area

mostly separate changes, together in one patch because they all interact together in the test cases. Splitting into three patches would create gnarly conflicts in the test cases.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nCOALESCE is converted by Calcite's parser to CASE, which is largely counterproductive for us, because it ends up duplicating expressions. In the current code we end up un-doing it in our CaseOperatorConversion. This patch has a different approach:\r\n\r\n1) Add CaseToCoalesceRule to convert CASE back to COALESCE earlier, before the Volcano planner runs, using CaseToCoalesceRule.\r\n\r\n2) Add FilterDecomposeCoalesceRule to decompose calls like `f(COALESCE(x, y))` into `(x IS NOT NULL AND f(x)) OR (x IS NULL AND f(y))`. This helps use indexes when available on `x` and `y`.\r\n\r\n3) Add CoalesceLookupRule to push COALESCE into the third arg of LOOKUP.\r\n\r\n4) Add a native \"coalesce\" function so we can convert 3+ arg COALESCE.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of this approach is that by un-doing the CASE to COALESCE conversion earlier, we have flexibility to do more stuff with COALESCE (like decomposition and pushing into LOOKUP).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSEARCH is an operator used internally by Calcite to represent matching an argument against some set of ranges. This patch improves our handling of SEARCH in two ways:\r\n\r\n1) Expand NOT points (point \"holes\" in the range set) from SEARCH as `!(a || b)` rather than `!a && !b`, which makes it possible to convert them to a `not` of `in` filter later.\r\n\r\n2) Generate those nice conversions for NOT points even if the SEARCH is not composed of 100% NOT points. Without this change, a SEARCH for `x NOT IN ('a', 'b') AND x < 'm'` would get converted like `x < 'a' OR (x > 'a' AND x < 'b') OR (x > 'b' AND x < 'm')`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOne of the steps we take when generating Druid queries from Calcite plans is to optimize native filters. This patch improves this step:\r\n\r\n1) Extract common ANDed predicates in ConvertSelectorsToIns, so we can convert `(a && x = 'b') || (a && x = 'c')` into `a && x IN ('b', 'c')`.\r\n\r\n2) Speed up CombineAndSimplifyBounds and ConvertSelectorsToIns on ORs with lots of children by adjusting the logic to avoid calling `indexOf` and `remove` on an ArrayList.\r\n\r\n3) Refactor ConvertSelectorsToIns to reduce duplicated code between the handling for `selector` and `equals` filters.","created_at":"2024-01-02T11:27:29Z","updated_at":"2024-01-29T07:40:58Z","closed_at":"2024-01-03T16:56:22Z","merged_at":"2024-01-03T16:56:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"01eec4a55e708205d45f004fe93ef1ddaecf3b30","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":82655274,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjY1NTI3NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Documentation","name":"Area

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #15600\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR. Remove this section if there is no corresponding issue. Don't reference the issue in the title of this pull-request. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are a committer, follow the PR action item checklist for committers:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/committer-instructions.md#pr-and-issue-action-item-checklist-for-committers. -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing. If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them.

What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

[io.grpc:grpc-netty-shaded](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java) from 1.57.2 to 1.60.1.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/releases\">io.grpc:grpc-netty-shaded's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v1.60.1</h2>\n<h1>Bug Fixes</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>util: Fix NPE when multiple addresses in an address group for petiole load balancer policies (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10770\">#10770</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v1.60.0</h2>\n<h3>API Changes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>api: Stabilize <code>ForwardingServerBuilder</code>, <code>ForwardingChannelBuilder2</code>, and <code>ForwardingChannelBuilder</code>. Note that <code>ForwardingChannelBuilder</code> is stabilized (no changes will be made to it), but immediately deprecated in favor of <code>ForwardingChannelBuilder2</code>. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10586\">#10586</a>)</li>\n<li>api: Deprecate <code>ForwardingChannelBuilder.delegate()</code>. De facto this deprecates the class itself, since all classes extending <code>ForwardingChannelBuilder</code> implement the <code>delegate()</code> method. See javadoc for details (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10587\">#10587</a>)</li>\n<li>api: Changed recently-introduced <code>LoadBalancer.acceptResolvedAddresses()</code> to return <code>Status</code> instead of <code>boolean</code> (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10636\">#10636</a>). This is part of continued work to align the LB API cross-language and API stabilization</li>\n<li>stub: Deprecate StreamObservers (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10654\">#10654</a>)</li>\n<li>alts: AltsChannelBuilder now extends <code>ForwardingChannelBuilder2</code> (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10587\">#10587</a>)</li>\n<li>protobuf: Stabilize <code>ProtoUtils.metadataMarshaller()</code> (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10628\">#10628</a>)</li>\n<li>protobuf-lite: ProtoLiteUtils experimental comment (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10627\">#10627</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Behavior Changes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>core: <code>ManagedChannel</code>s now check the address types provided by the nameResolver (for the given target) with the address types supported by the channel transport and generate an error in case of mismatch. That dramatically improves the error message when an issue occurs</li>\n<li>core: When a server stream is closed due to user's code (an uncaught exception in halfClosed, messagesAvailable, onReady callback of a ServerStream's listener), the <code>Status.UNKNOWN</code> returned to the client will have <code>Application error processing RPC</code> description. Previously the description was empty. This is helpful to differentiate between server errors originated in user application, gRPC library, or even those injected by a proxy. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10643\">#10643</a>)</li>\n<li>xds: Log ORCA UNIMPLEMENTED error to subchannel logger. This removes them from the normal application logs, reducing log spam</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Improvements</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Change the underlying implementations of RingHash, RoundRobin, WeightedRoundRobin and LeastRequest load balancers to utilize the pick first load balancer rather than directly manage subchannels. This should only be noticeable if it introduced a bug</li>\n<li>core: Avoid flushing headers when the server returns a single response (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/9314\">#9314</a>). This is a performance optimization to reduce the number of packets for non-streaming responses</li>\n<li>util: Make grpc-core an implementation dependency. This will prevent the io.grpc.internal classes in grpc-core from being visible during compilation when depending on just grpc-util</li>\n<li>netty: Implement <code>Http2Headers.isEmpty()</code>. This fixes compatibility with Netty 4.1.101.Final.</li>\n<li>netty: Add <code>NettyServerBuilder.maxRstFramesPerWindow()</code>. This can be used to limit impact of Rapid Reset</li>\n<li>netty: Disable huffman coding in headers (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10563\">#10563</a>). Huffman coding provides modest compression for relatively high CPU usage, especially within a data center. Rely just on the HPACK static and dynamic tables for compression, for higher performance. This only impacts header values 512 bytes or longer, as Netty already disabled Huffman for smaller values</li>\n<li>alts: Improve handshake failure error message by propagating original exception (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10644\">#10644</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>util: Remove shutdown subchannels from OD tracking (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10683\">#10683</a>). This could have caused a memory leak on a long-lived channel. But we don’t think it could be triggered with our built-in load balancing policies.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Dependencies</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Bump Netty to 4.1.100.Final</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Acknowledgements</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/anthonyjpratti\"><code>@​anthonyjpratti</code></a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/fedorka\"><code>@​fedorka</code></a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jpd236\"><code>@​jpd236</code></a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/mateusazis\"><code>@​mateusazis</code></a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/pkoenig10\"><code>@​pkoenig10</code></a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/yannickepstein\"><code>@​yannickepstein</code></a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/amirhadadi\"><code>@​amirhadadi</code></a></p>\n<h2>v1.59.1</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>netty: Implement <code>Http2Headers.isEmpty()</code>.

TCP accept queue size.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThe ServerConnector class defaults _acceptQueueSize to 0 which appears to result in a value of min(net.core.somaxconn, 50) on Jetty being passed to the listen() system call. This number can be too low especially when there are many brokers/coordinators trying to setup connections to a historical or real-time index process.\r\n\r\nWhen this queue fills up there will be dropped packets and there can be downstream connection timeouts/connection resets depending on the underlying system settings (e.g. if syncookies are enabled).\r\n\r\n#### Fixed the bug ...\r\n#### Renamed the class ...\r\n#### Added a forbidden-apis entry ...\r\nI originally decided to make  _acceptQueueSize a configurable property, but to avoid adding another configuration I decided to follow the logic I saw in dropwizard (a java web framework) when configuring jetty.(https://github.com/dropwizard/dropwizard/blob/7f6827d119639a57d2a696d371c3bbdb3007acb5/dropwizard-jetty/src/main/java/io/dropwizard/jetty/NetUtil.java#L37).\r\n\r\nEssentially this checks the value of '/proc/sys/net/core/somaxconn' and sets _acceptQueueSize to that value, or the default linux value for somaxconn of 128 if the file is not readable.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nIncrease _acceptQueueSize based on value of net.core.somaxconn.\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `JettyServerModule`\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [X] been tested in a test Druid

Description\r\nWhen `batchAllocationWaitTime` is set to `0`, the segment allocation queue is polled continuously even when it is empty. This would take up cpu cycles unnecessarily.\r\n\r\nSome existing race conditions would also become more frequent when the `batchAllocationWaitTime` is `0`. This PR tries to better address those race conditions as well.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- Do not reschedule a poll if queue is empty\r\n- When a new batch is added to queue, schedule a poll\r\n- Simplify keyToBatch map\r\n- Handle race conditions better\r\n- As soon as a batch starts getting processed, do not add any more requests to it\r\n\r\n### Alternate approach\r\nIt would be much simpler to do a long poll of the queue, but we cannot do that here since we first peek at the batch at head of the queue and pop it only if it is due. There doesn't seem to be an equivalent long peek 🙂.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

a segment of a requested segment granularity cannot be allocated due to conflicting segments, we try to exhaust all finer granularity segments before giving up.\r\nHowever when the preferred granularity is month or coarser, and a week granular segment is allocated to adjust with the conflict, the cluster can end up in a bad state because a week granular segment doesn't necessarily align with the end of the month or higher granular interval.\r\nTo prevent this problem, we consider day granular segments after month in the sequence.\r\nWeekly segments are skipped and are not allocated unless explicitly requested for.\r\n\r\nSuppose an hour segment exists for 16th December, 2023 from 12am-1am, and a new segment needs to be allocated for the timestamp 18th December. After this patch:\r\n1. If the requested granularity is WEEK, create a week granular segment with the interval [2023-12-18/2023-12-25].\r\n2. If the requested granularity is MONTH\r\n  A. A MONTH granular segment cannot be created as a segment already exists for the month which doesn't span the whole month.\r\n  B. A DAY segment (and not a WEEK) is chosen from [2023-12-18/2023-12-19] and created as it is the next valid granularity and has no conflicts.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\nFixes some bugs with `and`/`or`/ and numeric `nvl` not clearing out stale 'null' vectors for vector expression processing causing rows to incorrectly be considered as null. The tests that should have caught this were actually hiding this bug by making a new binding and processor for every iteration instead of re-using the processor for a bunch of different bindings, so the problem never was hit because the vectors were not being re-used.\r\n\r\nI also stumbled across a couple small bugs with expression vector processor output types, which I have also fixed.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code

Description\r\nThis PR adds support for using underlying column indexes for `ExpressionVirtualColumn` which have a single input column, similar to what `ExpressionFilter` can do in the same scenario. It achieves this a bit differently however. `ExpressionFilter` can make the filter expression itself into a predicate and push it down as a `DruidPredicateFactory` to the underlying `DruidPredicateIndexes`, if the expression evaluates to true then the value matches, if not then it doesn't. `ExpressionVirtualColumn` however is making arbitrary values which can be matched by _other_ filters such as equality or ranges, and so instead needs a mechanism to supply its own indexes. So, we expose an implementation of `DruidPredicateIndexes` that can accept any `DruidPredicateFactory`, and then use the `DictionaryEncodedValueIndex` which exposes low level access to the dictionary and value indexes of the underlying column so that we can scan the values of the dictionary to use as inputs to the expression and then feed the transformed values to the appropriate type of predicate from the `DruidPredicateFactory` based on the output type of the expression. \r\n\r\nI decided to push this all the way down to `Expr`, using the predicate index implementation as the default, but also allow individual expressions to produce more optimized index suppliers. I have currently only wired this up to `IdentifierExpr`, which can simply delegate directly to the underlying `ColumnIndexSupplier` because it is a direct column access expression. This means that an expression virtual column which just has an identifier should now be able to produce equivalent performance during filtering as if the column was used directly.\r\n\r\nThis measures pretty well, using a regex expression as an example, which in the first example uses no indexes and the second uses the new expression predicate indexes showed a decent performance boost (the virtual column performance should be approximately the same to using an expression filter or extractionFn directly, which also use predicate indexes).\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT string4, COUNT(*) FROM foo WHERE REGEXP_EXTRACT(string1, '^1') IS NOT NULL OR REGEXP_EXTRACT('Z' || string2, '^Z2') IS NOT NULL GROUP BY 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nbefore:\r\n```\r\nBenchmark                        (query)  (rowsPerSegment)  (schema)  (vectorize)  Mode  Cnt    Score    Error  Units\r\nSqlExpressionBenchmark.querySql       40           5000000  explicit        false  avgt    5  279.224 ±  3.353  ms/op\r\nSqlExpressionBenchmark.querySql       40           5000000      auto        false  avgt    5  274.911 ±  5.642  ms/op\r\n```\r\n\r\nafter:\r\n```\r\nBenchmark                        (query)  (rowsPerSegment)  (schema)  (vectorize)  Mode  Cnt    Score   Error  Units\r\nSqlExpressionBenchmark.querySql       40           5000000  explicit        false  avgt    5  194.301 ± 4.236  ms/op\r\nSqlExpressionBenchmark.querySql       40           5000000      auto        false  avgt    5  187.447 ± 3.748  ms/op\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis improvement allows us to make some changes to the SQL planner to prefer using `ExpressionVIrtualColumn` with other native filters over falling back to `ExpressionFilter` in many cases, since now there is no penalty to using a virtual column, which can result in more efficient plans, such as being able to collapse multiple filters on the same column, and also re-use expression computation.\r\n\r\nFor example, given a query like:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"506\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-12-20 at 10 24 20 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/druid/assets/1577461/a119e628-a3d2-49e6-b80c-344a9f3bd8ae\">\r\n\r\nbefore this change would produce a rather inefficient set of expression filters that looked something like this, where effectively each separate expression filter would have to individually scan all of the underlying values in the dictionary to find the matches\r\n\r\n<img width=\"626\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-12-20 at 3 57 57 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/druid/assets/1577461/6a14bb4d-8516-47f4-aff7-b0dea76a7ad2\">\r\n\r\n\r\nbut after some adjustments to take advantage of the improvements in this PR, will now plan to\r\n\r\n<img width=\"560\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-12-20 at 10 23 30 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/druid/assets/1577461/654aa000-7364-43d6-a20f-fab2da1b750b\">\r\n\r\nbecause of the shared common virtual column expression, and only has to evaluate the indexes and compute the expression values a single time, and can be collapsed into an 'IN' filter because the planner can recognize the 'OR' of 'equals' pattern can be condensed into an 'IN'.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

[io.grpc:grpc-netty-shaded](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java) from 1.57.2 to 1.60.0.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/releases\">io.grpc:grpc-netty-shaded's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v1.60.0</h2>\n<h3>API Changes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>api: Stabilize <code>ForwardingServerBuilder</code>, <code>ForwardingChannelBuilder2</code>, and <code>ForwardingChannelBuilder</code>. Note that <code>ForwardingChannelBuilder</code> is stabilized (no changes will be made to it), but immediately deprecated in favor of <code>ForwardingChannelBuilder2</code>. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10586\">#10586</a>)</li>\n<li>api: Deprecate <code>ForwardingChannelBuilder.delegate()</code>. De facto this deprecates the class itself, since all classes extending <code>ForwardingChannelBuilder</code> implement the <code>delegate()</code> method. See javadoc for details (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10587\">#10587</a>)</li>\n<li>api: Changed recently-introduced <code>LoadBalancer.acceptResolvedAddresses()</code> to return <code>Status</code> instead of <code>boolean</code> (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10636\">#10636</a>). This is part of continued work to align the LB API cross-language and API stabilization</li>\n<li>stub: Deprecate StreamObservers (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10654\">#10654</a>)</li>\n<li>alts: AltsChannelBuilder now extends <code>ForwardingChannelBuilder2</code> (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10587\">#10587</a>)</li>\n<li>protobuf: Stabilize <code>ProtoUtils.metadataMarshaller()</code> (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10628\">#10628</a>)</li>\n<li>protobuf-lite: ProtoLiteUtils experimental comment (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10627\">#10627</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Behavior Changes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>core: <code>ManagedChannel</code>s now check the address types provided by the nameResolver (for the given target) with the address types supported by the channel transport and generate an error in case of mismatch. That dramatically improves the error message when an issue occurs</li>\n<li>core: When a server stream is closed due to user's code (an uncaught exception in halfClosed, messagesAvailable, onReady callback of a ServerStream's listener), the <code>Status.UNKNOWN</code> returned to the client will have <code>Application error processing RPC</code> description. Previously the description was empty. This is helpful to differentiate between server errors originated in user application, gRPC library, or even those injected by a proxy. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10643\">#10643</a>)</li>\n<li>xds: Log ORCA UNIMPLEMENTED error to subchannel logger. This removes them from the normal application logs, reducing log spam</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Improvements</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Change the underlying implementations of RingHash, RoundRobin, WeightedRoundRobin and LeastRequest load balancers to utilize the pick first load balancer rather than directly manage subchannels. This should only be noticeable if it introduced a bug</li>\n<li>core: Avoid flushing headers when the server returns a single response (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/9314\">#9314</a>). This is a performance optimization to reduce the number of packets for non-streaming responses</li>\n<li>util: Make grpc-core an implementation dependency. This will prevent the io.grpc.internal classes in grpc-core from being visible during compilation when depending on just grpc-util</li>\n<li>netty: Implement <code>Http2Headers.isEmpty()</code>.

slowness while doing audits seems to be causing flakiness in auth ITs.\r\nThe failing test is almost always `ITBasicAuthConfigurationTest.test_avaticaQuery_datasourceAndContextParamsUser` but in some rare cases, other tests fail too. Alternately, this failing test has been seen to pass too.\r\n\r\nIt is most likely because the auth changes are not able to propagate in time from the coordinator to other services.\r\n\r\n### Fix for now\r\nJust log the audits rather than persisting them to database. Most audits have been newly added and it is okay to not have them persisted. Moreover, logging audits can also be more beneficial while debugging an IT.\r\n\r\n### Later\r\n- We should consider persisting audits to metadata store in an async fashion.\r\n- Add some ITs that specifically test metadata-based audits.","created_at":"2023-12-14T14:12:29Z","updated_at":"2024-01-29T07:41:09Z","closed_at":"2023-12-23T06:41:12Z","merged_at":"2023-12-23T06:41:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"cce539495d38536807cac57054209bb0e9a2f1c8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1048471070,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDQ4NDcxMDcw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Flaky%20test","name":"Flaky

Description\r\n\r\nThe code in the groupBy engine and the topN engine assume that the dimensions are comparable and can call `dimA.compareTo(dimB)` to sort the dimensions and group them together.\r\nThis works well for the primitive dimensions, because they are Comparable, however falls apart when the dimensions can be arrays (or in future scenarios complex columns). In cases when the dimensions are not comparable, Druid resorts to having a wrapper type `ComparableStringArray` and `ComparableList`, which is a Comparable, based on the list comparator.\r\n\r\nA cleaner approach would be to assume that each type is associated with a comparator - for primitives, it would be the natural comparator, and for arrays it would be the list comparator, and use the comparator to compare the dimensions for sorting. This code achieves the same, each dimension is comparable if:\r\n1. We know its type -> We can use the ComparisonUtil to fetch the comparator associated with the type\r\n2. We know the dimension is an Object in the desired type -> We resort to coercion using the DimensionHandlerUtils to coerce the dimension (from the column value selectors) into the necessary type (interchange numerics to their desired type, convert List to Object[] for arrays, parse strings if permitted etc). This coercion is necessary to allow rogue selectors (perhaps from extensions or expressions) to work well with the engine. Druid has been lenient in what selector's #getObject() can return, because it casts such cases in multiple places. Till we have strictly typed selectors, this coercion will be needed. The good thing about refactoring is that it is separate from 1, so once we feel coercion is not required, we can get rid of it easily. \r\n\r\nSince this is a refactor, there's no user-facing impact of the same. \r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

The first test `testPollEmpty` tries to assert the contents of the segments in the `sqlSegmentsMetadataManager` are empty. The second test `testStopAndStart` tries to start and stop the `sqlSegmentsMetadataManager`. The second test does not modify the contents of segments in the `sqlSegmentsMetadataManager` and does not affect the assertions in the first test. We can run all the tests just on a single `sqlSegmentsMetadataManager` to speed up the tests in the test class `SqlSegmentsMetadataManagerEmptyTest`. The runtime can decrease from `2.997 s` to `2.285 s` after applying the changes when run on our own machine.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion.

was looking into a query which was performing a bit poorly because the `case_searched` was touching more than `1` columns (if there is only 1 column there is a cache based evaluator).\r\nWhile I was doing that I've noticed that there are a few simple things which could help a bit:\r\n* use a static `TRUE`/`FALSE` instead of creating a new object every time\r\n* create the `ExprEval` early for `ConstantExpr` -s (except the one for `BigInteger` which seem to have some odd contract)\r\n* return early from type autodetection\r\n\r\nthese changes mostly reduce the amount of garbage the query creates during `case_searched` evaluation; although  `ExpressionSelectorBenchmark` shows some improvements `~15%` - but my manual trials on the taxi dataset with 60M rows showed more improvements - probably due to the fact that these changes mostly only reduce gc pressure.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>q1.3</summary>\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT \r\n  case when \r\n    LOOKUP(\"dropoff\", 'look') =

Description\r\nAdds the enhancements from #13977 to traditional string columns to improve performance of filter processing by allowing obviously expensive bitmap operations to be skipped. While I haven't run the benchmarks, I assume a similar improvement for string columns that are not created with the 'auto' indexer as were seen in #13977. Previously this performance enhancement was only available for 'auto' and 'json' columns.\r\n\r\nThis is related to #15550 to help replace the 'auto' search strategy.\r\n\r\nI've not documented the configs behind this yet in this PR because I'm still thinking on how to frame what these configs do in an understandable manner without requiring deep knowledge of how query processing actually works. For the most part these settings should probably not be tweaked by users, but will try to think of something and add docs in a follow-up PR.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nString columns created with the 'string' column indexer now have an enhancement for filter match processing that was previously only available to columns created by the 'auto' indexer, and will automatically skip obviously expensive index computation for filters which would require a very large number of bitmap operations. This should improve performance, particularly when filter clauses contain a mix of simple and complex filters since it allows the complex filters. Previously Druid would always utilize indexes if they were available, and this behavior can be returned by setting `druid.processing.skipValuePredicateIndexScale` and `druid.processing.skipValueRangeIndexScale` to `1.0`.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x]

Description\r\nRemoves the 'auto' strategy from the native search query to simplify `BitmapColumnIndex` to remove the `estimateSelectivity` method. The 'auto' strategy is not on by default, and in some cases can be rather expensive since for logical filters like AND/OR we fetch all of the indexes, compute the cardinality of each of them, and then throw them away, sometimes to turn around and do the same thing again to actually use the indexes.\r\n\r\nThe replacement for this will be smarter usage of indexes for all query types, as a follow-up I plan to bring the enhancements of #13977 to classic string typed columns, and I've got some additional improvements coming in the future.\r\n\r\n[Related dev mailing list thread](https://lists.apache.org/thread/8lbgbo2977c88xxp714znmkg3w2lbkdj)\r\n\r\n(This release note is currently a lie, but a follow-up PR will make it more true.)\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nThe 'auto' strategy has been removed from the [search query](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/querying/searchquery). Specifying 'auto' will now be equivalent to specifying 'useIndexes'. Improvements to how and when indexes are computed in general have allowed 'useIndexes' to benefit and be more adaptive when it uses indexes for filter processing, skipping computing expensive indexes when possible.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] a release note entry in the PR

Description\r\nThis removes the pin of the Snakeyaml introduced in: \r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/pull/14519\r\nAfter the updates of io.kubernetes.java-client and io.confluent.kafka-clients, the only uses of the Snakeyaml 1.x are:\r\n- in test scope, transitive dependency of jackson-dataformat-yaml:jar:2.12.7\r\n- in compile scope in contrib extension druid-cassandra-storage\r\n- in compile scope in it-tests. \r\n\r\nWith the dependency version un-pinned, io.kubernetes.java-client and io.confluent.kafka-clients bring Snakeyaml versions 2.0 and 2.2, consequently allowing to build a Druid distribution without the contrib-extension and free of vulnerable Snakeyaml versions. \r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or

added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test Druid

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews.

How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews.

Description\r\nFixes an issue which can occur when using `ExpressionPostAggregator` on on array types output from grouping engine in certain situations such as inline data. The grouping engine uses wrapper types for arrays, `ComparableStringArray` and `ComparableList` so that they implement `Comparable` (current requirement for all grouping dimension types). The native expression system did not recognize these types, leading to them being treated as `COMPLEX` rather than `ARRAY` types, which made stuff sad. \r\n\r\nThis also made an adjustment to `FunctionalExpr` which after #14987 was causing things like cast exceptions to eventually end up going through `DruidException.defensive` and presented as unknown server-side errors. While in this case the class cast exception really was a bug, in most cases it would not be, and so these are now handled as user errors so that the exception message is now shown to the user.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.
