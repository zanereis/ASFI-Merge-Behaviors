to this commit, the default `DictAttrs` for an `IRModule`, `tir::PrimFunc`, `relax::Function`, and `relay::Function` was a null value.  At each callsite, the absence of a `DictAttrs` needed to be treated as equivalent to an empty `DictAttrs`.  In C++, this typically was done using the `foo->GetAttr` helper function, but in Python it needed to be checked explicitly.  That is, every callsite needed to check `if func.attrs is not None and attr_name in func.attrs`, rather than only checking `if attr_name in func.attrs`.\r\n\r\nSince most functions would have at least one attribute to specify the global symbol, these bugs would often surface when working on unrelated changes.\r\n\r\nThis commit changes the default attribute dictionary from `NullValue<DictAttrs>()` to `DictAttrs()`.  This avoids having two separate representations of an object without any attributes, and allows the `if attr_name in func.attrs` pattern in the Python

to this commit, the constructors for `relax.Function` and `relax.FuncStructInfo` provided a default annotation as a pure function.  While this could be overridden, it\r\n\r\nThis commit updates the IR to store purity as `Optional<Bool>` instead of `bool`, and changes the default to `NullOpt`.\r\n\r\nA function's purity can have three possible values:\r\n\r\n- `Bool(true)`: The function is known to be pure.\r\n- `Bool(false)`: The function is known to be impure.\r\n- `NullOpt`: The function's purity is unknown.\r\n\r\nIn most cases `Bool(false)` and `NullOpt` should be treated equivalently, as they both indicate a function that may contain side effects.  However, in the future, inference of purity may occur when the purity is `NullOpt`, based on analysis of a function's body.  A function with purity of `Bool(false)` is known to be impure, and further analysis is unnecessary.","created_at":"2024-03-19T12:58:59Z","updated_at":"2024-09-11T16:22:18Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"adbd5ac1b04ff718177a27753b2354986f205d91","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16744/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16744/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16744/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/8a73bc691f087783c605e306e9c6dc3e8496f3fb","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:relax_default_to_unknown_purity","ref":"relax_default_to_unknown_purity","sha":"8a73bc691f087783c605e306e9c6dc3e8496f3fb","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

`relax.TensorStructInfo`.","created_at":"2024-03-19T00:11:11Z","updated_at":"2024-05-09T11:48:45Z","closed_at":"2024-05-09T11:48:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b7e759022b1a124564c3ffef3f314398de4ff7ce","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16737/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16737/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16737/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/260c8f1fc8509bad5edae9667beb7d16343dc4c2","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:slm_allow_tensor_struct_info_in_spec","ref":"slm_allow_tensor_struct_info_in_spec","sha":"260c8f1fc8509bad5edae9667beb7d16343dc4c2","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

IndexDB Cache, including the following:\r\n\r\n- Implement ArtifactIndexedDBCache to cache model with IndexedDB.\r\n- Add storetype to addToCache() and fetchWithCache() such that users need to specify either \"json\" or \"arraybuffer\" when using the APIs, instead of calling .json() or .arraybuffer() on their own outside of the function call.\r\n- Move all cache-related code to artifact_cache.ts.\r\n- Remove cacheOnly for callback in fetchNDArrayCache(), use loading instead (since we separated download and loading).\r\n\r\nOne change to use the IndexDBCache is, as there's no json() response when calling fetchCacheData, thinking about removing the .json() when calling fetchCacheData. @CharlieFRuan

to this PR, there is one part missing in the shared memory estimation of the GeMV rule. The GeMV rule optimizes by using cross-thread reduction. When the target does not support warp reduction primitives, the cross-thread reduction will be further lowered to shared memory implementation, which consumes another part of shared memory.\r\n\r\nIf we do not consider this part in the GeMV rule, it is possible for the total shared memory usage to exceed the target shared memory limit. For example, mlc-ai/mlc-llm#1841 reports an issue on the Vulkan shared memory limit exceed.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the issue by introducing a flag `SUPPORT_WARP_SHUFFLE` to the GeMV rule. We only enable warp shuffle for CUDA and Metal backend, and turn it off for all other backends. This is basically aligned with the lowering rule of thread allreduce intrinsic.\r\n\r\nP.S.. ROCm also supports warp shuffle but has some limitation, where not every set of parameters in the GeMV rule can meet. Therefore, we regard ROCm as \"not supported\". This just mean we will be conservative in the shared memory usage for ROCm, and does not mean we do not use the warp shuffle when the workload is eligible when

to this commit, the `PatternRewriter` mutator handled pattern rewriting at either the expression level (`rewrite_call`) or the dataflow block level (`rewrite_bindings`).  These two functionalities had different external APIs, defined diffierent member variables, and visited different IR nodes.  In effect, it had two entirely independent implementations, which just happened to be implemented within the same class.\r\n\r\nThis commit refactors the single `PatternRewriter` mutator into separate `BlockPatternRewriter` and `ExprPatternRewriter` mutators.","created_at":"2024-03-16T14:48:44Z","updated_at":"2024-03-26T13:43:40Z","closed_at":"2024-03-26T13:43:36Z","merged_at":"2024-03-26T13:43:36Z","merge_commit_sha":"016b512ad4950cba32eaf81be0cfe3c0321851f7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16730/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16730/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16730/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/65e9808cbe1ecf249a91233f32b948fef098ba7d","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:relax_refactor_dataflow_matcher","ref":"relax_refactor_dataflow_matcher","sha":"65e9808cbe1ecf249a91233f32b948fef098ba7d","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

PR supports sliding window attention and attention sink for PagedKVCache, so that PagedKVCache can back models such as Mistral.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, this PR removes the \"Attention\" function (without fused-qkv) from AttentionKVCache interface, given its usage is now completely covered by the \"AttentionWithFusedQKV\" function. Considering the cost of maintenance, we decide to remove it for now. When in the future there is the need of this function, we will add it back.\r\n\r\nThis PR also unifies the global function names of the PagedKVCache with the KVState introduced earlier, and introduces a new KV cache raw info query function to get the current total sequence length in the KV cache.","created_at":"2024-03-15T21:39:33Z","updated_at":"2024-03-16T16:16:32Z","closed_at":"2024-03-16T16:16:32Z","merged_at":"2024-03-16T16:16:32Z","merge_commit_sha":"b8f64c21c5cce8ce0fa00e341f1e169f1fc59891","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16729/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16729/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16729/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/52fbbd752320657e04875c895cc1009c47227ab1","head":{"label":"MasterJH5574:tvm-dev/2024-03-15-kv-cache-sliding-window","ref":"tvm-dev/2024-03-15-kv-cache-sliding-window","sha":"52fbbd752320657e04875c895cc1009c47227ab1","user":{"login":"MasterJH5574","id":45167100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY3MTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45167100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574","html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":311185744,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMTExODU3NDQ=","name":"tvm","full_name":"MasterJH5574/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MasterJH5574","id":45167100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY3MTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45167100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574","html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574/tvm","description":"Open

to this commit, the `tir.PlanAndUpdateBufferAllocationLocation` pass would attempt to merge buffer allocations, unless the buffer's backing allocation was found in a `Allocate`, `AllocateConst`, or `PrimFuncNode::params`.  Previous\r\nPRs (e.g. https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/10998) collected these locations and marked them as unmanaged.  However, this requires exhaustively checking all locations where unmanaged allocations could occur.\r\n\r\nThis PR updates `tir.PlanAndUpdateBufferAllocationLocation` to instead collect the managed buffers, and only perform rewrites of these managed buffers.  This only required inspection of `BlockNode`, and no other constructs.\r\n\r\nThe unit test added in this PR is another location where unmanaged buffers may be produced.","created_at":"2024-03-15T12:31:44Z","updated_at":"2024-03-18T19:36:30Z","closed_at":"2024-03-18T19:22:33Z","merged_at":"2024-03-18T19:22:33Z","merge_commit_sha":"6df42d4b987fd9f1f9c89f41fdc918ebaeab3817","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16726/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16726/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16726/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/3de4074f60e9749cd0647cf820ddb3bb47571965","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:tir_bugfix_planning_with_unmanaged_buffers","ref":"tir_bugfix_planning_with_unmanaged_buffers","sha":"3de4074f60e9749cd0647cf820ddb3bb47571965","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

PR implements `LinearCongruentialGenerator` in TVMjs, following the C++ counterpart in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/8642/. The motivation is that we want to seed autoregressive generation to make results reproducible, supporting the OpenAI field `seed`. The main function is `nextInt()`, which generates a number `(0, 2^32 - 1)` non-inclusive.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, we change all `Math.random()` in `runtime.ts` to `this.rng.randomFloat()`, exposing API `Instance.setSeed()`.\r\n\r\nUnit tests are added for `LinearCongruentialGenerator` for testing seed and coverage.","created_at":"2024-03-14T21:50:11Z","updated_at":"2024-03-15T14:10:34Z","closed_at":"2024-03-15T14:10:34Z","merged_at":"2024-03-15T14:10:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"45df1247c66adf117d6a690aea3f51e3c1bd0453","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16722/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16722/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16722/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/90289cccfa5e6590ea842e5b174f97c88315f0d8","head":{"label":"CharlieFRuan:pr-web-RNG","ref":"pr-web-RNG","sha":"90289cccfa5e6590ea842e5b174f97c88315f0d8","user":{"login":"CharlieFRuan","id":53290280,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMjkwMjgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53290280?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan","html_url":"https://github.com/CharlieFRuan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":717204711,"node_id":"R_kgDOKr-s5w","name":"tvm","full_name":"CharlieFRuan/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CharlieFRuan","id":53290280,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMjkwMjgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53290280?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan","html_url":"https://github.com/CharlieFRuan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CharlieFRuan/tvm","description":"Open

While introducing dma operations at graph level, relax `KillAfterLastUse` pass introduces `kill_tensor` operation after `dma_copy`. This leads to memory being deallocated when asynchronous copy operation is in progress. Hence, moving the input/output buffers to `dma_wait` to ensure `kill_tensor` is introduced after `dma_wait` at the graph level.\r\n- Also, the logic for size calculation is updated to use `GetDataSize` function. \r\n- The test case is updated to use offsets instead of allocating different storage in VTCM.","created_at":"2024-03-12T06:43:32Z","updated_at":"2024-03-15T08:41:29Z","closed_at":"2024-03-15T08:06:18Z","merged_at":"2024-03-15T08:06:17Z","merge_commit_sha":"94866f769acfc4582607a2a0e818de263c9a1a60","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16706/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16706/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16706/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/34a4d2eee39aca8b94fe52dd41711dab0f692ecc","head":{"label":"abhikran-quic:abhikran/dma_builtin_fix","ref":"abhikran/dma_builtin_fix","sha":"34a4d2eee39aca8b94fe52dd41711dab0f692ecc","user":{"login":"abhikran-quic","id":63697863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNjk3ODYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63697863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhikran-quic","html_url":"https://github.com/abhikran-quic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhikran-quic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhikran-quic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhikran-quic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhikran-quic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhikran-quic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhikran-quic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhikran-quic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhikran-quic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhikran-quic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":413298012,"node_id":"R_kgDOGKJtXA","name":"tvm","full_name":"abhikran-quic/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"abhikran-quic","id":63697863,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNjk3ODYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63697863?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhikran-quic","html_url":"https://github.com/abhikran-quic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhikran-quic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhikran-quic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhikran-quic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhikran-quic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhikran-quic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhikran-quic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhikran-quic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhikran-quic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhikran-quic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/abhikran-quic/tvm","description":"Open

Therefore, prior to this PR, when simplifying `x * 1024 + y < z * 7168`, it will fails with the error message\r\n```\r\nInternalError: Check failed: value < 1LL << (dtype.bits() - 1)\r\n(8589934591

https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/15233\r\n\r\nThis is the Milestone 5 for MSC: Add MSCWrapper as compression toolchain.\r\nTo limit each PR in reviewable size, the Milestone 5 will be split into some steps:\r\n[M5.1] Build wrapper to support compression.\r\n**[M5.2] Enable quantize && prune with gym by wrapper.**\r\n[M5.3] Support torch.dynamo for dynamic models.\r\n\r\nGym for msc works like autotvm to tvm. Gym use environment to evaluate compression strategy and agent will search the best strategy.\r\n\r\nThis PR:\r\n  1. Refactor the gym system. The example of using gym for auto compression is: https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/main/gallery/how_to/work_with_msc/using_tools.py, use `python use_tools.py --prune --gym` to test auto compression.\r\n  2. Refactor the register for MSC objects, so that custom tools can be register for optimize the model.\r\n  3. Enable export after run msc pipeline. The exported tar.gz package can be used for loading model\r\n \r\ncc @Hzfengsy

to this commit, compiling cutlass kernels left temporary files in the working directory.  These temporary files are then left on disk after building.  This commit updates the default behavior when building cutlass to produce files in a temporary directory, which is cleaned up on completion.\r\n\r\nSince this change on its own would make it difficult to view and debug the generated cutlass code, this commit also maintains a copy of the generated source in the cutlass module.

PR enables asyncify support for web runtime.\r\n\r\nAsyncify is a feature to allow C++ to call async function in javascript. The emcc compiler will unwind and store the stack, returning control to JS runtime. The JS runtime needs to be able to await the promise and then call rewind to get to the original suspended point.\r\n\r\nThis feature can be potentially useful when we would like to call WebGPU sync in C++ runtime. As on web platform everything have to be non-blocking. Previously we simply forbid c++ runtime to call sync and have to return to javascript side and let javascript side to call async.\r\n\r\nBecause asyncify can increase the wams size by 2x, we don't enable it by default in emcc.py and still would need to pass in options.\r\n\r\nWe will confirm potential benefit tradeoffs before turning it on by default. Another catch is that as of now asyncify is not compatible with wasm exception, so we temporary turn wasm-exception it off for now. This is an item that is being worked on by emscripten so we might be able to turn it back on later.\r\n\r\nThe testcases are added.\r\n\r\nreference:

PR enhances the `dump_ndarray_cache` function to take generator as input. Previously it can only take a dictionary.\r\n\r\nSometimes, it is possible that the total ndarray size cannot fit the main CPU memory, in which case we may turn to using generators so we can free some NDArray memory on the fly.

PR enhances PagedKVCache with the copy stream separation. In detail, for CUDA and ROCm backend, we create a standalone copy stream for the copy of auxiliary data structure from CPU to GPU. Furthermore, we move the copy from BeginForward to Attention, which means it's no longer eagerly executed, instead, becoming lazily executed when Attention computation is needed.\r\n\r\nBy making these changes, we are able to overlap the auxiliary data copy time (on the copy stream) with the model forward computation that happens before the first Attention. As a result, we can hide some of the copy latency.\r\n\r\nThis PR also bumps the version of FlashInfer for the copy stream support.","created_at":"2024-03-09T15:02:14Z","updated_at":"2024-03-10T21:28:27Z","closed_at":"2024-03-10T21:28:27Z","merged_at":"2024-03-10T21:28:27Z","merge_commit_sha":"dc7d6873badeabddf98824c807fefe4a1a45194b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16692/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16692/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16692/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/e76323a45ef74ca627f0038c6633da07872c45b5","head":{"label":"MasterJH5574:tvm-dev/2024-03-09-kv-cache-copy-stream","ref":"tvm-dev/2024-03-09-kv-cache-copy-stream","sha":"e76323a45ef74ca627f0038c6633da07872c45b5","user":{"login":"MasterJH5574","id":45167100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY3MTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45167100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574","html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":311185744,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMTExODU3NDQ=","name":"tvm","full_name":"MasterJH5574/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MasterJH5574","id":45167100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY3MTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45167100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574","html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574/tvm","description":"Open

to this commit, the `nn.modules.KVCache` implementations used `R.call_packed(...)` to call the `\"vm.builtin.attention_*\"` functions. Since `nn.Module` emits all relax functions within a `relax.DataflowBlock`, where impure expressions are forbidden, this is ill-formed.\r\n\r\nThis commit updates the implementations in `nn.modules.KVCache` to use `R.call_pure_packed` instead of `R.call_packed`.  This assertation that the callee is pure allows the call to occur within a `relax.DataflowBlock`.","created_at":"2024-03-06T16:05:16Z","updated_at":"2024-03-11T13:05:23Z","closed_at":"2024-03-10T21:12:02Z","merged_at":"2024-03-10T21:12:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"f988cb48d116defec5bbf6a1dd70cc1e538af203","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16684/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16684/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16684/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/eaafc1eec514caa0ec8ce5b7f610d4e101da3394","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:bugfix_slm_call_pure_packed_in_nn_module_kvcache","ref":"bugfix_slm_call_pure_packed_in_nn_module_kvcache","sha":"eaafc1eec514caa0ec8ce5b7f610d4e101da3394","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

some cases, an `AttrStmt` may legally refer to a TIR variable that hasn't yet been defined.  For example, the\r\n`\"pragma_parallel_launch_point\"` attribute, which annotates a variable that is about to occur in a ForNode.  Prior to this commit, `ConvertSSA` treated the `AttrStmt` as the usage of a variable, followed by a nested definition to be de-duplicated.  This resulted in the output `AttrStmt` containing a reference to an undefined variable.\r\n\r\nThis commit updates `ConvertSSA` to handle this case.  If an `AttrStmt` refers to a not-yet-defined variable, the body is visited before marking it as defined.\r\n\r\nThis implementation may be simplified in the future by moving \"pragma_parallel_launch_point\" to be an annotation on the `ForNode`, rather than an `AttrStmt`.","created_at":"2024-03-06T14:54:54Z","updated_at":"2024-03-10T17:20:59Z","closed_at":"2024-03-09T03:16:25Z","merged_at":"2024-03-09T03:16:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"898f87ffd6ea74fc839f5c002965cd848ce0adb1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16682/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16682/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16682/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/f480fa4ca315a387aebf2d9b16aa402269cddedc","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:bugfix_tir_ssa_pragma_parallel","ref":"bugfix_tir_ssa_pragma_parallel","sha":"f480fa4ca315a387aebf2d9b16aa402269cddedc","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

first fix related to the problem when we build TVM with `USE_CLML` option and OpenCL header files were not found in the system. The second fix is for building CLML graph executor in Android build. `find_library` on MacOS is looking for libraries with `dylib` extension.  This is why OpenCL libraries from CLML SDK were not found. To fix this problem we specify paths to the libraries manually in case if they were not found by `find_library`.\r\n\r\ncc: @srkreddy1238

`T.block`.  However, inferred `T.reads()` for a buffer defined by the `\"tir.BindParams\"` pass would be erroneously missing.  These annotations may be required for correct scheduling (see discussion in [PR#16660](https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/16660)).\r\n\r\nThis commit updates the TVMScript parsing to infer `T.reads()` and `T.writes()` annotations for buffers defined with `DeclBuffer` nodes.","created_at":"2024-03-01T15:15:27Z","updated_at":"2024-03-05T23:50:20Z","closed_at":"2024-03-04T13:56:19Z","merged_at":"2024-03-04T13:56:19Z","merge_commit_sha":"31bb4b58fe1b99ec8c626a7252e159d9d94dd7dd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16663/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16663/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16663/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/b2156574f8cae9246dde067bb394548bac7ec140","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:tvmscript_infer_decl_buffer_access_region","ref":"tvmscript_infer_decl_buffer_access_region","sha":"b2156574f8cae9246dde067bb394548bac7ec140","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

inserting a `cache_read` / `cache_write` stage, the `tir.AllocateConst` statement would be duplicated if its body was not a `tir.SeqStmt` node (e.g. `tir.For`), leading to compilation failures. This happened because `tir.AllocateConst` and `tir.DeclBuffer` statements are always re-attached to the statement's body after the `cache_read` / `cache_write` stage is inserted in it, but the stage was being appended to the whole statement (which already contains the `tir.AllocateConst`) and not just its body, causing duplications.\r\n\r\nThis commit also adds a test where the first `cache_read` stage is inserted into a statement whose body is a `tir.For`, while the second stage is added to a body that is `tir.SeqStmt` to check for regressions.  \r\n\r\ncc @Lunderberg @ekalda @lhutton1

is a follow-up commit to https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/16641.  While parsing of relax expressions without a variable binding could be implemented at that point (e.g. `R.assert_op(condition)` instead of `dummy_var = R.assert_op(condition)`), the corresponding printing changes could not.  This was because a variable that satisfies `relax::HasVoidStructInfo(var)` could still be used later in the function, and removing its binding would result in use of an undefined variable.\r\n\r\nThis commit normalizes use of void-type variables to an in-line `R.tuple()`.  This simplifies the relax function, and also allows the binding of void-type variables to be hidden.","created_at":"2024-02-29T13:49:03Z","updated_at":"2024-03-13T21:52:51Z","closed_at":"2024-03-13T21:52:42Z","merged_at":"2024-03-13T21:52:42Z","merge_commit_sha":"8023a981a4908d8bbaaf0a2128f2f4dda7418392","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16658/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16658/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16658/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/d556b555e6317b3bfd8fb4bcbfc191f5df1362b7","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:relax_normalize_use_of_void_variable","ref":"relax_normalize_use_of_void_variable","sha":"d556b555e6317b3bfd8fb4bcbfc191f5df1362b7","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

PR expands Relax's NN frontend with operators needed to support emerging video models like SVD. The main change needed is adding support for Conv3D, but a few other minor changes were found to be helpful as well. Specifically the ability to rewrite resize2D's layout manually was quite helpful for performance, so I expanded it's convertlayout pass to support that. I also added a few more options to Conv2D in the nn frontend such as specifying layout.","created_at":"2024-02-28T17:11:46Z","updated_at":"2024-03-06T18:48:13Z","closed_at":"2024-03-06T18:48:13Z","merged_at":"2024-03-06T18:48:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"d284cf421205e6bea47f6a43c7e490cae5bf9607","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"junrushao","id":22515877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTE1ODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22515877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao","html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16654/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16654/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16654/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/1c80d0c02b061a9177da321289b71821e79239d9","head":{"label":"jwfromm:jwfromm/nn_conv3d","ref":"jwfromm/nn_conv3d","sha":"1c80d0c02b061a9177da321289b71821e79239d9","user":{"login":"jwfromm","id":9874242,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4NzQyNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9874242?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm","html_url":"https://github.com/jwfromm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":185874049,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODU4NzQwNDk=","name":"tvm","full_name":"jwfromm/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jwfromm","id":9874242,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4NzQyNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9874242?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm","html_url":"https://github.com/jwfromm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jwfromm/tvm","description":"Open

`topi.cuda.inclusive_scan` currently relies on performing an `exclusive_scan` followed by an add operation that adds the input data back in. To eliminate the overhead introduced by this extra addition, probably we should have an implementation specifically designed for `inclusive_scan`. As of now, the implementation of `inclusive_scan` is limited to `exclusive_scan_ir`, developing an `inclusive_scan_ir` will be needed for performance in the future.\r\n\r\nIn this pull request, we

to this commit, the condition used for `relax::If` node and the `\"relax.assert_op\"` operator was required to be a scalar tensor.  This made it difficult to alter behavior based on a runtime shape parameter.  For example, delegating to a vectorized implementation based on a whether a tensor shape is divisible by the vector size.\r\n\r\nThis commit adds support for expressions of type `R.Prim('bool')` as the conditional for `relax::If` and `\"relax.assert_op\"`, to allow these use

to this commit, TVMScript required all relax expressions to be part of an explicit assignment or return statement.  While this matches the structure of the C++ IR types, this can be unexpected for functions that have no return value.  For example, needing to assign the result of `R.print(...)` to a variable.\r\n\r\nThis commit updates the TVMScript parser/printer to allow relax expressions to be used as statements, if they have a void return type. This allows use of `R.print(...)` and `R.assert_op(...)` to be called without assigning the result to an unused variable.","created_at":"2024-02-23T23:07:42Z","updated_at":"2024-03-12T15:36:36Z","closed_at":"2024-03-12T15:36:12Z","merged_at":"2024-03-12T15:36:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"436d8f9691dc7e9213e7114b1bc87392211d3909","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16641/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16641/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16641/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/8ed29a0571ec79df374c98db9f48ccb8dc924236","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:tvmscript_allow_void_relax_expr_as_stmt","ref":"tvmscript_allow_void_relax_expr_as_stmt","sha":"8ed29a0571ec79df374c98db9f48ccb8dc924236","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open
