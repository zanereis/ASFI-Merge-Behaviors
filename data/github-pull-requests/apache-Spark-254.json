operator doesn't consume all the data then the Task cleanup may happen before Python side read process finishes, this in turn create a race condition that the block read locks are freed during Task

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is the part of the essential changes in Spark to make **[SPARK-14083] Basic bytecode analyzer to speed up Datasets** work as an external module without copying and pasting. \r\n\r\n1. Makes `getSerializedLambda` public so bytecode analysis can use the same implementation.\r\n2. `def schemaFor[T](clazz: Class[T]): Schema` is implemented in this PR.\r\n3. `org.javassist` which Spark implicitly depends on from Jersey is now an explicit dependency and pined to latest version.\r\n\r\nThis PR is based on https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/24515 with more tests; it's a collaboration work with @aokolnychyi\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nMore tests are

duplicate call.\r\nIn simple terms, repeated calls don't seem to have big performance problems, but if you look at the details, you know that it includes some Java reflection.\r\nAFAIK, Java

optimizations can not be performed. Consequently, reflective operations have slower performance than their non-reflective counterparts, and should be avoided in sections of code which are called frequently in performance-sensitive applications.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have found some performance cost test of Java reflection as

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThere are several kinds of shuffle client, blockTransferService and externalShuffleClient.\r\n\r\nFor the externalShuffleClient,  there are relative external shuffle service, which guarantees  the shuffle block data and regardless the  state of executors.\r\n\r\nFor the blockTransferService, it is used to fetch broadcast block, and fetch the shuffle data when external shuffle service is not enabled. \r\n\r\nWhen fetching data by using blockTransferService, the shuffle client would connect relative executor's blockManager, so if the relative executor is dead, it would never fetch successfully.\r\n\r\nWhen spark.shuffle.service.enabled is true and spark.dynamicAllocation.enabled is true,  the executor will be removed while it has been idle  for more than idleTimeout.\r\n\r\nIf a blockTransferService create connection to relative executor successfully, but the relative executor is removed when beginning to fetch broadcast block, it would retry (see RetryingBlockFetcher), which is Ineffective.\r\n\r\nIf the spark.shuffle.io.retryWait and spark.shuffle.io.maxRetries is big,  such as 30s and 10 times, it would waste 5 minutes.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we check whether relative executor is alive before retry.\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n**Description from JIRA**\r\nFor the JDBC option `query`, we use the identifier name to start with underscore: s\"(${subquery}) _SPARK_GEN_JDBC_SUBQUERY_NAME${curId.getAndIncrement()}\". This is not supported by Oracle.\r\nThe Oracle doesn't seem to support identifier name to start with non-alphabet character (unless it is quoted) and has length restrictions as well. [link](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14200/sql_elements008.htm)\r\n\r\nIn this PR, the generated alias name 'SPARK_GEN_JDBC_SUBQUERY_NAME<int value>' is fixed to remove \"_\" prefix and also the alias name is shortened to not exceed the identifier length limit.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nTests are added for MySql, Postgress, Oracle and DB2 to ensure enough coverage.","created_at":"2019-05-06T01:41:23Z","updated_at":"2019-05-06T06:14:42Z","closed_at":"2019-05-06T04:55:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4fb74b959b997b457d8dd232740bd137e7132d8a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24532/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24532/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24532/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/da136edbd44506aca6cec6bacb20b46af46fc23a","head":{"label":"dilipbiswal:SPARK-27596","ref":"SPARK-27596","sha":"da136edbd44506aca6cec6bacb20b46af46fc23a","user":{"login":"dilipbiswal","id":14225158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjI1MTU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14225158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal","html_url":"https://github.com/dilipbiswal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42921897,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjkyMTg5Nw==","name":"spark","full_name":"dilipbiswal/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dilipbiswal","id":14225158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjI1MTU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14225158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal","html_url":"https://github.com/dilipbiswal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dilipbiswal/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe scenario is submitting multiple jobs concurrently with spark dynamic allocation enabled. The issue happens in determining RDD partition numbers. When there are more available CPU cores, spark will try to split RDD to more pieces. But since the file is stored as parquet format, parquet's row group is actually the basic unit block to read data. Splitting RDD to too many small pieces doesn't make sense.\r\nJobs will launch too many partitions and never complete.\r\n![Screen Shot 2019-05-05 at 5 45 15

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nShuffle manager is pluggable in Spark, however, some service closely related to the shuffle functionality is constrained to 1 or 2 implementations. One example is `NettyBlockTransferService`, it is used in BlockManager to fetch remote bytes, and to fetch shuffle data in non-external shuffle. The 2 functionalities are coupled together. Actually the latter functionality to fetch shuffle data should be pluggable/extensible.\r\n\r\nA custom Spark shuffle manager may need the set of service, including the RPC servers, clients and context that `NettyBlockTransferService` has constructed(constructing a new set of connections between executors is redundant), but also a new `NettyBlockTransferService` with custom need. For example, a remote shuffle manager under disaggregated compute and storage architecture may only need the service to transfer index files from other executors(for cache purpose) through Netty, but read data files directly from the globally-accessible storage.\r\n\r\nWe propose to make this transfer service for shuffle pluggable, also make some fields in `NettyBlockTransferService` wider accessible for developers to extend.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests.","created_at":"2019-05-05T08:33:03Z","updated_at":"2019-12-31T00:06:34Z","closed_at":"2019-12-31T00:06:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fa28ed945322b518fc9b541ad52a0d2669291a9e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIt will repeating calculate table statistics in 2 cases.\r\n1. Insert into a Hive table with`spark.sql.statistics.size.autoUpdate.enabled=false` and `table.stats.nonEmpty`. The first time called by `Hive.loadTable` and the  second time called by `Hive.alterTable`. The stacktrace:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5399861/57791191-d549c400-776e-11e9-93e1-564b8790484a.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5399861/57791272-032f0880-776f-11e9-832a-397b88ebe41d.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Insert into a Hive table with`spark.sql.statistics.size.autoUpdate.enabled=true`. The first time called by `Hive.loadTable` and the second time called by `CommandUtils.updateTableStats -> Hive.alterTable`\r\n\r\nThe PR update the logic to avoid repeating calculate table statistics.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nIt's difficult to add a unit test. So manual test this pr:\r\n```shell\r\nbuild/sbt clean package -Phive\r\nexport SPARK_PREPEND_CLASSES=true\r\nbin/spark-shell --conf spark.sql.statistics.size.autoUpdate.enabled=true\r\n```\r\n```scala\r\nsc.setLogLevel(\"INFO\")\r\nspark.sql(\"create table t1(id int) using hive\")\r\nspark.sql(\"insert into t1 values(1)\")\r\n```\r\nIt will show:\r\n```\r\n19/05/09 06:40:03 INFO CommandUtils: Skip to update statistics for default.t1 as it updated by Hive.\r\n```\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-04T04:52:57Z","updated_at":"2019-07-19T10:18:15Z","closed_at":"2019-07-19T10:18:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f4bb29a80fa5dbb2ca70dfe94d53210eeb7e7937","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24523/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24523/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24523/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ac45dc3f2f839526016c4d89f57fc427eb44dbb4","head":{"label":"wangyum:SPARK-27631","ref":"SPARK-27631","sha":"ac45dc3f2f839526016c4d89f57fc427eb44dbb4","user":{"login":"wangyum","id":5399861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzOTk4NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5399861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum","html_url":"https://github.com/wangyum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"d9bcacf94b93fe76542b5c1fd852559075ef6faa","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn SPARK-27612, one correctness issue was reported. When protocol 4 is used to pickle Python objects, we found that unpickled objects were wrong. A temporary fix was proposed by not using highest protocol.\r\n\r\nIt was found that Opcodes.MEMOIZE was appeared in the opcodes in protocol 4. It is suspect to this issue.\r\n\r\nA deeper dive found that Opcodes.MEMOIZE stores objects into internal map of Unpickler object. We use single Unpickler object to unpickle serialized Python bytes. Stored objects intervenes next round of unpickling, if the map is not cleared.\r\n\r\nWe has two options:\r\n\r\n1. Continues to reuse Unpickler, but calls its close after each unpickling.\r\n2. Not to reuse Unpickler and create new Unpickler object in each unpickling.\r\n\r\nThis patch takes option 1.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPassing the test added in SPARK-27612

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR partially reverts https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/20691\r\n\r\nAfter we changed the Python protocol to highest ones, seems like it introduced a correctness bug. This potentially affects all Python related code paths.\r\n\r\nI suspect a bug related to Pryolite (maybe opcodes `MEMOIZE`, `FRAME` and/or our `RowPickler`). I would like to stick to default protocol for now and investigate the issue separately.\r\n\r\nI will separately investigate later to bring highest protocol back.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdate:\r\nI can almost confirm that this is a bug in Pyrolite.\r\n\r\n1. Python lists are chunked via `BatchedSerializer` at `parallelize` (in `createDataFrame`), for instance, as below (each line is each batch):\r\n\r\n    ```bash\r\n    [[1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4]]\r\n    [[1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4]]\r\n    ...\r\n    [[1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4]]\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    Here is opcodes for each batch (separated by `===..`) with protocol 4:\r\n    <details>\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    ==============================\r\n        0: \\x80 PROTO      4\r\n        2: \\x95 FRAME      47\r\n       11: ]    EMPTY_LIST\r\n       12: \\x94 MEMOIZE    (as 0)\r\n       13: (    MARK\r\n       14: ]        EMPTY_LIST\r\n       15: \\x94     MEMOIZE    (as 1)\r\n       16: (        MARK\r\n       17: K            BININT1    1\r\n       19: K            BININT1    2\r\n       21: K            BININT1    3\r\n       23: K            BININT1    4\r\n       25: e            APPENDS    (MARK at 16)\r\n       26: \\x85     TUPLE1\r\n       27: \\x94     MEMOIZE    (as 2)\r\n       28: h        BINGET     1\r\n       30: \\x85     TUPLE1\r\n       31: \\x94     MEMOIZE    (as 3)\r\n       32: h        BINGET     1\r\n       34: \\x85     TUPLE1\r\n       35: \\x94     MEMOIZE    (as 4)\r\n       36: h        BINGET     1\r\n       38: \\x85     TUPLE1\r\n       39: \\x94     MEMOIZE    (as 5)\r\n       40: h        BINGET     1\r\n       42: \\x85     TUPLE1\r\n       43: \\x94     MEMOIZE    (as 6)\r\n       44: h        BINGET     1\r\n       46: \\x85     TUPLE1\r\n       47: \\x94     MEMOIZE    (as 7)\r\n       48: h        BINGET     1\r\n       50: \\x85     TUPLE1\r\n       51: \\x94     MEMOIZE    (as 8)\r\n       52: h        BINGET     1\r\n       54: \\x85     TUPLE1\r\n       55: \\x94     MEMOIZE    (as 9)\r\n       56: e        APPENDS    (MARK at 13)\r\n       57: .

Those batches become binary in an RDD at `parallelize` - so far results look fine\r\n\r\n3. `rdd._to_java_object_rdd` -> `SerDeUtil.pythonToJava` -> `Unpickler.loads`\r\n\r\n4. Here, Pryolite `Unpickler.loads` converts each Python object batch into Java objects\r\n\r\n5. The converted Java objects look a bit odd from Pryolite as below (see the last three lists):\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    [1, 2, 3, 4]\r\n    [1, 2, 3, 4]\r\n    ...\r\n    [[[1, 2, 3, 4]], [[1, 2, 3, 4]]]\r\n    [[[1, 2, 3, 4]], [[1, 2, 3, 4]]]\r\n    [[[1, 2, 3, 4]], [[1, 2, 3, 4]]]\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n6. Last three nested lists are ignored via `EvaluatePython.makeFromJava` and becomes `null` -> `None`.\r\n\r\n7. So the Jenkins test was failed at https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/24519#issuecomment-488913729 as below:\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n      File

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n### Background:\r\nThe data source option `pathGlobFilter` is introduced for Binary file format: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/24354 , which can be used for filtering file names, e.g. reading `.png` files only while there is `.json` files in the same directory.\r\n\r\n### Proposal:\r\nMake the option `pathGlobFilter` as a general option for all file sources. The path filtering should happen in the path globbing on Driver.\r\n\r\n### Motivation:\r\nFiltering the file path names in file scan tasks on executors is kind of ugly.\r\n\r\n### Impact:\r\n1. The splitting of file partitions will be more balanced.\r\n2. The metrics of file scan will be more accurate.\r\n3. Users can use the option for reading other file sources.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-02T23:52:35Z","updated_at":"2020-01-08T07:24:47Z","closed_at":"2019-05-08T23:44:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0514dd57e81dc1a7430872a5a2a3c230b91036b6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24518/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24518/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24518/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d8f8420d9d3c97f96c1e09855e008ece3f275ad3","head":{"label":"gengliangwang:globFilter","ref":"globFilter","sha":"d8f8420d9d3c97f96c1e09855e008ece3f275ad3","user":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":95047635,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NTA0NzYzNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"gengliangwang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang/spark","description":"Mirror

The purpose of this PoC PR is to trigger a discussion on whether it is feasible to leverage bytecode analysis to speed up Datasets. This PR shows what can be achieved by interpreting stack-based bytecode directly. The current version does not handle all edge cases. If the community agrees that bytecode analysis can give substantial benefits, we will need to define the scope (i.e., which cases we are targeting) and decide which approach to take (e.g., stack-based bytecode interpretation, flow-control graphs, AST, Jimple). I would like to emphasize that this PR doesn't answer those questions. Instead, it shows what can be done with the simplest approach. Also, there is no intention to integrate this logic into Spark directly. It might be a separate package.\r\n\r\n### Scope\r\n\r\nBytecode analysis can be used for several purposes:\r\n- Provide information on what's going on inside closures so that Spark can perform additional optimizations while still relying on closures during execution (e.g., analyze which fields are accessed/modified and use that information to optimize the plan).\r\n- Replace typed operations that rely on closures with equivalent untyped operations that rely on Catalyst expressions.\r\n\r\nRewriting closures is challenging but gives more benefits. So, this PR focuses on the second use case.\r\n\r\nRight now, the code covers typed map and filter operations that involve primitive values, boxed values (not all are implemented), objects that are represented as structs (e.g., case classes). The same logic can be applied to UDFs/UDAFs and other operations.\r\n\r\n### Algorithm\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to derive Catalyst expressions:\r\n- Translate stack-based bytecode directly.\r\n- Convert bytecode into an intermediate format that it is easier to work with (e.g., flow-control graphs, AST, Jimple).\r\n\r\nBoth approaches have their own tradeoffs, which are well-described in comments to [SPARK-14083](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-14083). This PR translates stack-based bytecode directly and simulates what happens to the operand stack. The optimizer is supposed to simplify the derived expression. I think it is valid to start with the simplest approach and evaluate its limitations before considering a more advanced implementation.\r\n\r\nOriginally, we wanted to cover trivial cases. However, the current scope is much bigger, so we should consider an intermediate format and will be glad to hear more opinions. As it was mentioned before, the decision highly depends on our target use cases.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new optimizer rule `RewriteTypedOperations` that uses `TypedOperations` in order to convert typed operations into untyped. `TypedOperations` follows a trivial algorithm that is described below.\r\n\r\n#### Step 1: Get closure bytecode\r\n\r\nFirst of all, we need to get bytecode for the closure. Scala 2.12 migrated to Java lambdas and uses `LambdaMetafactory` (LMF) (seems like there are rare cases when Scala doesn't use LMF). This PR relies on the existing logic in Spark to obtain `SerializedLambda`, which has enough information to get bytecode for closures.\r\n\r\nScala uses \"adapted\" methods for LMF to encapsulate differences in boxing semantics (i.e., unboxing null in Scala gives 0 and NPE in Java). The current code will obtain bytecode of the non-adapted method whenever the args are primitives to avoid a round of unnecessary boxing/unboxing.\r\n\r\nSee `ClosureUtils$getMethod` for more information.\r\n\r\n#### Step 2: Build a correct local variable array\r\n\r\nOnce we have bytecode for our closure, we need to build a local variable array that references correct Catalyst expressions. This can be achieved by translating the deserializer for a typed operation. Deserializers define how data is converted from the Spark internal format into Java objects. Frequently, deserializers contain `StaticInvoke`, `Invoke`, `NewInstance` expressions, which can be translated using the same algorithm.\r\n\r\nSee `TypedOperations$convertDeserializer` for more information.\r\n\r\n#### Step 3: Create an operand stack\r\n\r\nThe next step is to create an operand stack for storing partial Catalyst expressions. The current code uses `mutable.ArrayStack[Expression]` for this purpose.\r\n\r\n#### Step 4: Interpret instructions\r\n\r\nOnce we have bytecode, the array of local variables and the operand stack, we can follow our bytecode instructions one by one and simulate what happens to the operand stack.\r\n\r\n#### Step 5: Assign the result back to the expected attributes\r\n\r\nOnce we have the result expression, we need to assign it to columns. At this point, the serializer is important as it contains information about the expected attributes and their data types.\r\n\r\n### Trying things out\r\n\r\n`DatasetBytecodeAnalysisBenchmark` and `BytecodeAnalysisSuite` show currently supported cases. The focus is on the conceptual approach and not on addressing every possible method/instruction.\r\n\r\n### Open Questions\r\n\r\n- We need to discuss the scope of this work. As mentioned before, we can either translate closures into Catalyst expressions or just derive additional information about the content of closures (if that's useful enough).\r\n- We need to discuss the overall approach we want to take (e.g., bytecode interpretation, control-flow graphs, AST, Jimple).\r\n- We need to discuss which library (if any) to use.\r\n- We need to handle too complicated result expressions as they can slow down the computation. For example, we can introduce some thresholds. Apart from that, we can introduce more optimization rules to simplify expressions.\r\n- We need to ensure the conversion is lightweight and doesn't slow down the job planning time.\r\n- We need to handle cases when the conversion doesn't terminate (e.g., infinite recursion).\r\n- We need to ensure that edge cases work properly (e.g., null handling, exceptions, arithmetic expressions).\r\n- We need to decide how to properly handle flow control instructions (e.g., if statements). The current code handles them via recursion and

is called both during training and scoring phases, but the checks against the training related params like loss should really be performed during training phase only, I think, please correct me if I'm missing anything :)\r\n\r\nThis issue was first reported for mleap (https://github.com/combust/mleap/issues/455) because basically when we serialize the Spark transformers for mleap, we only serialize the params that are relevant for scoring. We do have the option to de-serialize the serialized transformers back into Spark for scoring again, but in that case, we no longer have all the training params. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded a unit test to check this scenario. \r\n\r\nPlease let me know if there's anything additional required, this is the first PR that I've raised in this project.\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-01T21:00:37Z","updated_at":"2020-03-02T19:14:57Z","closed_at":"2019-05-03T23:19:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"03384e75925601b0049142ab19e31def574646ed","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24509/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24509/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24509/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/dfcd014c52a243eb8c2d2a357b1bf18064e4b11e","head":{"label":"ancasarb:linear_regression_params_fix","ref":"linear_regression_params_fix","sha":"dfcd014c52a243eb8c2d2a357b1bf18064e4b11e","user":{"login":"ancasarb","id":5312198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMTIxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5312198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ancasarb","html_url":"https://github.com/ancasarb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ancasarb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ancasarb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ancasarb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ancasarb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ancasarb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ancasarb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ancasarb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ancasarb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ancasarb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"9623420b77d81677b3fc5f055e6f521274e9caef","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nPR #23890 introduced `org.glassfish.jaxb:jaxb-runtime:2.3.2` as a runtime dependency. As an unexpected side effect, `jakarta.activation:jakarta.activation-api:1.2.1` was also pulled in as a transitive dependency. As a result, for the Maven build, both of the following two jars can be found under `assembly/target/scala-2.12/jars/`:\n\n```\nactivation-1.1.1.jar\njakarta.activation-api-1.2.1.jar\n```\n\nThis PR exludes the Jakarta one.\n\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nManually built Spark using Maven and checked files under `assembly/target/scala-2.12/jars/`. After this change, only `activation-1.1.1.jar` is

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds SparkR with Arrow optimization documentation.\r\n\r\nNote that looks CRAN issue in Arrow side won't look likely fixed soon, IMHO, even after Spark 3.0.\r\nIf it happen to be fixed, I will fix this doc too later.\r\n\r\nAnother note is that Arrow R package itself requires R 3.5+. So, I intentionally didn't note this.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually built and checked.\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-01T14:40:14Z","updated_at":"2020-03-03T01:18:46Z","closed_at":"2019-05-02T01:04:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7cef6e6370c060e1fb4289d5356d417060568340","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24506/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24506/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24506/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8e7199476400572f177f156aae6421c335b5daea","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-26924","ref":"SPARK-26924","sha":"8e7199476400572f177f156aae6421c335b5daea","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`Row.toString` is currently causing the useless creation of an `Array` containing all the values in the row before generating the string containing it. This operation adds a considerable overhead.\r\n\r\nThe PR proposes to avoid this operation in order to get a faster implementation.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nRun\r\n\r\n```scala\r\ntest(\"Row toString perf test\") {\r\n    val n = 100000\r\n    val rows = (1 to n).map { i =>\r\n      Row(i, i.toDouble, i.toString, i.toShort, true, null)\r\n    }\r\n    // warmup\r\n    (1 to 10).foreach { _ => rows.foreach(_.toString) }\r\n\r\n    val times = (1 to 100).map { _ =>\r\n      val t0 = System.nanoTime()\r\n      rows.foreach(_.toString)\r\n      val t1 = System.nanoTime()\r\n      t1 - t0\r\n    }\r\n    // scalastyle:off println\r\n    println(s\"Avg time on ${times.length} iterations for $n toString:\" +\r\n      s\" ${times.sum.toDouble / times.length / 1e6} ms\")\r\n    // scalastyle:on println\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nBefore the PR:\r\n```\r\nAvg time on 100 iterations for 100000 toString: 61.08408419 ms\r\n```\r\nAfter the PR:\r\n```\r\nAvg time on 100 iterations for 100000 toString: 38.16539432 ms\r\n```\r\nThis means the new implementation is about 1.60X faster than the original one.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-01T14:39:13Z","updated_at":"2019-05-02T14:22:59Z","closed_at":"2019-05-02T14:22:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"15aa22a0d54ed8a508f52ad64b42a71f04838613","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24505/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24505/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24505/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5281fb14cfc0c561b34fc0908a86c8be63d3af7c","head":{"label":"mgaido91:SPARK-27607","ref":"SPARK-27607","sha":"5281fb14cfc0c561b34fc0908a86c8be63d3af7c","user":{"login":"mgaido91","id":8821783,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MjE3ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8821783?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91","html_url":"https://github.com/mgaido91","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":94518128,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NDUxODEyOA==","name":"spark","full_name":"mgaido91/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mgaido91","id":8821783,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MjE3ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8821783?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91","html_url":"https://github.com/mgaido91","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mgaido91/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n## Problem statement\r\n\r\nAn executor which has persisted blocks does not consider to be idle and this way ready to be released by dynamic allocation after the regular timeout `spark.dynamicAllocation.executorIdleTimeout` but there is separate configuration `spark.dynamicAllocation.cachedExecutorIdleTimeout` which defaults to `Integer.MAX_VALUE`. This is because releasing the executor also means losing the persisted blocks (as the metadata for individual blocks called `BlockInfo` are kept in memory) and when the RDD is referenced latter on this lost blocks will be recomputed. \r\nOn the other hand keeping the executors too long without any task to work on is also a waste of resources (as executors are reserved for the application by the resource manager).\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nThis PR focuses on the first part of SPARK-25888: it extends the external shuffle service with the capability to serve RDD blocks which are persisted on the local disk store by the executors. Moreover when this feature is enabled by setting the `spark.shuffle.service.fetch.rdd.enabled` config to true and a block is reported to be persisted on to disk the external shuffle service instance running on the same host as the executor is also registered (along with the reporting block manager) as a possible location for fetching it. \r\n\r\n## Some implementation detail\r\n\r\nSome explanation about the decisions made during the development:\r\n- the location list to fetch a block was randomized but the groups (same host, same rack, others) order was kept. In this PR the order of groups are kept and external shuffle service added to the end of the each group.\r\n- `BlockManagerInfo` is not introduced for external shuffle service but only a lightweight solution is taken. A hash map from `BlockId` to `BlockStatus` is introduced. A type alias would make the source more readable but I know it is discouraged. On the other hand a new class wrapping this hash map would introduce unnecessary indirection.\r\n- when this feature is on the cleanup triggered during removing of executors (which is handled in `ExternalShuffleBlockResolver`) is modified to keep the disk persisted RDD blocks. This cleanup is triggered in standalone mode when the `spark.storage.cleanupFilesAfterExecutorExit` config is set.\r\n- the unpersisting of an RDD is extended to use the external shuffle service for disk persisted RDD blocks when the original executor which created the blocks are already released. New block transport messages are introduced to support this: `RemoveBlocks` and `BlocksRemoved`.  \r\n\r\n# How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n## Unit tests\r\n\r\n### ExternalShuffleServiceSuite\r\n\r\nHere the complete use case is tested by the \"SPARK-25888: using external shuffle service fetching disk persisted blocks\" with a tiny difference: here the executor is killed manually, this way the test is a bit faster than waiting for the idle timeout.\r\n\r\n### ExternalShuffleBlockHandlerSuite\r\n\r\nTests the fetching of the RDD blocks via the external shuffle service.\r\n\r\n### BlockManagerInfoSuite \r\n\r\nThis a new suite. As the `BlockManagerInfo` behaviour depends very much on whether the external shuffle service enabled or not all the tests are executed with and without it.\r\n\r\n### BlockManagerSuite\r\n\r\nTests the sorting of the block locations. \r\n\r\n## Manually on YARN\r\n\r\nSpark App was:\r\n\r\n~~~scala\r\npackage com.mycompany\r\n\r\nimport org.apache.spark.rdd.RDD\r\nimport org.apache.spark.{SparkContext, SparkConf}\r\nimport org.apache.spark.storage.StorageLevel\r\n\r\nobject TestAppDiskOnlyLevel {\r\n  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {\r\n    val conf = new SparkConf().setAppName(\"test-app\")\r\n\r\n    println(\"Attila: START\")\r\n    val sc = new SparkContext(conf)\r\n    val rdd = sc.parallelize(0 until 100, 10)\r\n      .map { i =>\r\n        println(s\"Attila: calculate first rdd i=$i\")\r\n        Thread.sleep(1000)\r\n        i\r\n      }\r\n\r\n    rdd.persist(StorageLevel.DISK_ONLY)\r\n    rdd.count()\r\n\r\n    println(\"Attila: First RDD is processed, waiting for 60 sec\")\r\n\r\n    Thread.sleep(60 * 1000)\r\n\r\n    println(\"Attila: Num executors must be 0 as executorIdleTimeout is way over\")\r\n\r\n    val rdd2 = sc.parallelize(0 until 10, 1)\r\n      .map(i => (i, 1))\r\n      .persist(StorageLevel.DISK_ONLY)\r\n\r\n    rdd2.count()\r\n\r\n    println(\"Attila: Second RDD with one partition (only one executors must be alive)\")\r\n    \r\n    // reduce runs as user code to detect the empty seq (empty blocks)  \r\n    println(\"Calling collect on the first RDD: \" + rdd.collect().reduce(_ + _))\r\n\r\n    println(\"Attila: STOP\")\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nI have submitted with the following configuration:\r\n\r\n~~~bash\r\nspark-submit --master yarn \\\r\n  --conf spark.dynamicAllocation.enabled=true \\\r\n  --conf spark.dynamicAllocation.executorIdleTimeout=30 \\\r\n  --conf spark.dynamicAllocation.cachedExecutorIdleTimeout=90 \\\r\n  --class com.mycompany.TestAppDiskOnlyLevel dyn_alloc_demo-core_2.11-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nChecked the result by filtering for the side effect of the task calculations:\r\n\r\n~~~bash\r\n[user@server ~]$ yarn logs -applicationId application_1556299359453_0001 | grep \"Attila: calculate\" | wc -l\r\nWARNING: YARN_OPTS has been replaced by HADOOP_OPTS.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nTrack tasks separately for each stage attempt (instead of tracking by stage), and do NOT reset the numRunningTasks to 0 on StageCompleted.\r\n\r\nIn the case of stage retry, the `taskEnd` event from the zombie stage sometimes makes the number of `totalRunningTasks` negative, which will causes the job to get stuck.\r\nSimilar problem also exists with `stageIdToTaskIndices` & `stageIdToSpeculativeTaskIndices`.\r\nIf it is a failed `taskEnd` event of the zombie stage, this will cause `stageIdToTaskIndices` or `stageIdToSpeculativeTaskIndices` to remove the task index of the active stage, and the number of `totalPendingTasks` will increase unexpectedly.\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nunit test properly handle task end events from completed stages\r\n","created_at":"2019-04-30T14:02:56Z","updated_at":"2019-06-25T19:34:34Z","closed_at":"2019-06-25T19:34:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cb3303afd49399d4164940ac1e2c277da70af44e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis reverts commit 6f394a20bf49f67b4d6329a1c25171c8024a2fae.\r\n\r\nIn general, we need to be very cautious about the Jackson upgrade in the patch releases, especially when this upgrade could break the existing behaviors of the external packages or data sources, and generate different results after the upgrade. The external packages and data sources need to change their source code to keep the original behaviors. The upgrade requires more discussions before releasing it, I think.\r\n\r\nIn the previous PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/22071, we added the following claim in our security doc:\r\n> The Rest Submission Server and the MesosClusterDispatcher do not support authentication.  You should ensure that all network access to the REST API & MesosClusterDispatcher (port 6066 and 7077 respectively by default) are restricted to hosts that are trusted to submit jobs.\r\n\r\nWe need to understand whether this Jackson CVE applies to Spark. Before officially releasing it, we need more inputs from all of you. Currently, I would suggest to revert this upgrade from the upcoming 2.4.3 release, which is trying to fix the accidental default Scala version changes in pre-built artifacts. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nN/A","created_at":"2019-04-30T05:27:57Z","updated_at":"2019-06-07T13:08:08Z","closed_at":"2019-04-30T15:58:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c985cab2570baa991fa2c0fb66ff9cffe46941da","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24493/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/24493/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/24493/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b8672084b69a550e13f2cac2941a02a60fac8482","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:revert24418","ref":"revert24418","sha":"b8672084b69a550e13f2cac2941a02a60fac8482","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces the necessary Maven modules for the new [Spark Graph](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-25994) feature for Spark 3.0.\r\n\r\n* `spark-graph` is a parent module that users depend on to get all graph functionalities (Cypher and Graph Algorithms)\r\n* `spark-graph-api` defines the [Property Graph API](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Wxzghj0PvpOVu7XD1iA8uonRYhexwn18utdcTxtkxlI) that is being shared between Cypher and Algorithms\r\n* `spark-cypher` contains a Cypher query engine implementation\r\n\r\nBoth, `spark-graph-api` and `spark-cypher` depend on Spark SQL.\r\n\r\nNote, that the Maven module for Graph Algorithms is not part of this PR and will be introduced in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-27302\r\n\r\nA PoC for a running Cypher implementation can be found in this WIP PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/24297\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the Jenkins with all profiles and manually build and check the followings.\r\n```\r\n$ ls

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently `countDistinct(\"*\")` doesn't work. An analysis exception is thrown:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nval df = sql(\"select id % 100 from range(100000)\")\r\ndf.select(countDistinct(\"*\")).first()\r\n\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: Invalid usage of '*' in expression 'count';\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsers need to use `expr`.\r\n\r\n```scala\r\ndf.select(expr(\"count(distinct(*))\")).first()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis limits some API usage like `df.select(count(\"*\"), countDistinct(\"*))`.\r\n\r\nThe PR takes the simplest fix that lets analyzer expand star and resolve `count` function.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe test \"RequestExecutors reflects node blacklist and is serializable\" is flaky because of multi threaded access of the mock task scheduler. For details check [Mockito FAQ (occasional exceptions like: WrongTypeOfReturnValue)](https://github.com/mockito/mockito/wiki/FAQ#is-mockito-thread-safe). So instead of mocking the task scheduler in the test TaskSchedulerImpl is simply subclassed.\r\n\r\nThis multithreaded access of the `nodeBlacklist()` method is coming from:\r\n1) the unit test thread via calling of the method `prepareRequestExecutors()`\r\n2) the `DriverEndpoint.onStart` which runs a periodic task that ends up calling this method\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting unittest.\r\n\r\n(cherry picked from commit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nA follow-up task from SPARK-25348. To save I/O cost, Spark shouldn't attempt to read the file if users didn't request the `content` column. For example:\r\n```\r\nspark.read.format(\"binaryFile\").load(path).filter($\"length\" < 1000000).count()\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit test added.\r\n\r\nPlease review

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently we have an analyzer rule, which resolves the output columns of data source v2 writing plans, to make sure the schema of input query is compatible with the table.\r\n\r\nHowever, not all data sources need this check. For example, the `NoopDataSource` doesn't care about the schema of input query at all.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new table capability: ACCEPT_ANY_SCHEMA. If a table reports this capability, we skip resolving output columns for it during write.\r\n\r\nNote that, we already skip resolving output columns for `NoopDataSource` because it implements `SupportsSaveMode`. However, `SupportsSaveMode` is a hack and will be removed soon.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nnew test

log:\r\n\r\n**19/04/25 23:48:54 INFO Executor: 1 block locks were not released by TID = 0:\r\n[rdd_0_0]**\r\n\r\n and, If we set \"spark.storage.exceptionOnPinLeak\"=true, job will fail.\r\n\r\nNormally, we'll always release readLock for the block once we consumed all elements in a `CompletionIterator`. \r\nHowever, operation like take()/first() do not need to consume all, which lead to the release behaviour\r\ncan't be triggered.\r\n\r\nThis pr suggests to manually call `completion()` for the `CompletionIterator` if the iterator still has next\r\nelement after task finished, so that readLock could be released within `competion()`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes a bug which YARN file-related configurations are being overwritten when there're some values to assign - e.g. if `--file` is

After this patch the existing value and new value will be merged before assigning to the value of configuration.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded UT, and manually tested with below

Now the explain result of a dataset is not correctly consistent with the collected result of it, because we use pre-analyzed logical plan of the dataset in explain command.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently it's really hard to link SQL plan to Spark jobs on SparkSQL UI page. When one job failed, which `PhysicalPlan` nodes are involved are difficult to be located. This PR is to show the job info of `WholeStageCodegen` node on SparkSQL UI page to make life easier.\r\n\r\nEach `WholeStageCodegen` node has a task metric `PIPELINE_DURATION_METRIC` which records the total duration time shown in the top right. The idea is to put the job info into its metric value during metric aggregation.\r\n\r\n![SPARK-27565](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1247590/56744036-56362100-67aa-11e9-891c-74fc6d4df413.jpg)\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests & new

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/24144 . #24144 missed one case: when hash aggregate fallback to sort aggregate, the life cycle of UDAF is: INIT -> UPDATE -> MERGE -> FINISH.\r\n\r\nHowever, not all Hive UDAF can support it. Hive UDAF knows the aggregation mode when creating the aggregation buffer, so that it can create different buffers for different inputs: the original data or the aggregation buffer. Please see an example in the [sketches library](https://github.com/DataSketches/sketches-hive/blob/7f9e76e9e03807277146291beb2c7bec40e8672b/src/main/java/com/yahoo/sketches/hive/cpc/DataToSketchUDAF.java#L107). The buffer for UPDATE may not support MERGE.\r\n\r\nThis PR updates the Hive UDAF adapter in Spark to support INIT -> UPDATE -> MERGE -> FINISH, by turning it to  INIT -> UPDATE -> FINISH + IINIT -> MERGE -> FINISH.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\na new test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`window($\"fooTime\", \"2 seconds\").alias(\"fooWindow\")` can generate an expression tree  `Alias(fooWindow) <- TimeWindow`. The tree will become `Alias(fooWindow) <- Alias(window) <- Window(start, end)`  after analyzed by TimeWindowing rule. The `Alias(window)` got metadata of watermark when created:\r\n```\r\nval windowStruct = Alias(getWindow(0, 1), WINDOW_COL_NAME)(\r\nexprId = windowAttr.exprId, explicitMetadata = Some(metadata))\r\n``` \r\nbut the `Alias(fooWindow)` is created before  TimeWindowing rule effected. Its code path is:\r\n```\r\n...\r\ncase ne: NamedExpression => Alias(expr, alias)(explicitMetadata = Some(ne.metadata))\r\n...\r\n```\r\nbefore TimeWindowing rule effected, the `ne.metadata`  is  None and cause the watermark metadata lost\r\n\r\nWe make the `def name(alias: String)` return a `Alias` which  get metadata from its child automatically, when not specifying metadata explicitly.\r\n\r\nThank @LinhongLiu for helping analyzing this problem!\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd a UT and do the integration tests by run the example in jira successfully and do

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd a non-intrusive button for python API documentation, which will remove \">>>\" prompts and outputs of code - for easier copying of code.\r\n\r\nFor example: The below code-snippet in the document is difficult to copy due to \">>>\" prompts\r\n```\r\n>>> l = [('Alice', 1)]\r\n>>> spark.createDataFrame(l).collect()\r\n[Row(_1='Alice', _2=1)]\r\n\r\n```\r\nBecomes this - After the copybutton in the corner of of code-block is pressed - which is easier to copy \r\n```\r\nl = [('Alice', 1)]\r\nspark.createDataFrame(l).collect()\r\n```\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9406431/56715817-560c3600-6756-11e9-8bae-58a3d2d57df3.png)\r\n\r\n## File changes\r\nMade changes to python/docs/conf.py and copybutton.js - thus only modifying sphinx frontend and no changes were made to the documentation itself- Build process for documentation remains the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen there are mismatched types among cases or else values in case when expression, current error message is hard to read to figure out what and where the mismatch is.\r\n\r\nThis patch simply improves the error message for mismatched types for case when.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```scala\r\nscala> spark.range(100).select(when('id === 1, array(struct('id * 123456789 + 123456789 as \"x\"))).otherwise(array(struct('id * 987654321 + 987654321 as\r\n \"y\"))))

and ELSE expressions should all be same type or coercible to a common type;;  \r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n```scala\r\nscala> spark.range(100).select(when('id === 1, array(struct('id * 123456789 +

Row (\"Alice\", \"11\")\r\n<Row(Alice, 11)>\r\n\r\n>>> Row (name=\"Alice\", age=11)\r\nRow(age=11, name='Alice')\r\n\r\n>>> Row (\"Alice\", 11)\r\n<snip stack trace>\r\nTypeError: sequence item 1:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWe've seen some shuffle data corruption during shuffle read phase. \r\n\r\nAs described in SPARK-26089, spark only checks small  shuffle blocks before PR #23453, which is proposed by ankuriitg.\r\n\r\nThere are two changes/improvements that are made in PR #23453.\r\n\r\n1. Large blocks are checked upto maxBytesInFlight/3 size in a similar way as smaller blocks, so if a\r\nlarge block is corrupt in the starting, that block will be re-fetched and if that also fails,\r\nFetchFailureException will be thrown.\r\n2. If large blocks are corrupt after size maxBytesInFlight/3, then any IOException thrown while\r\nreading the stream will be converted to FetchFailureException. This is slightly more aggressive\r\nthan was originally intended but since the consumer of the stream may have already read some records and processed them, we can't just re-fetch the block, we need to fail the whole task. Additionally, we also thought about maybe adding a new type of TaskEndReason, which would re-try the task couple of times before failing the previous stage, but given the complexity involved in that solution we decided to not proceed in that direction.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think there still exists some problems with the current shuffle transmitted data verification mechanism:\r\n\r\n- For a large block, it is checked upto  maxBytesInFlight/3 size when fetching shuffle data. So if a large block is corrupt after size maxBytesInFlight/3, it can not be detected in data fetch phase.  This has been described in the previous section.\r\n- Only the compressed or wrapped blocks are checked, I think we should also check thease blocks which are not wrapped.\r\n\r\nThis pr complete the verification mechanism for shuffle transmitted data:\r\n\r\nFirstly, crc32 is choosed for the checksum verification  of shuffle data.\r\n\r\nCrc is also used for checksum verification in hadoop, it is simple and fast.\r\n\r\nDuring shuffle write phase, after completing the partitionedFile, we compute \r\n\r\nthe crc32 value for each partition and then write these digests with the indexs into shuffle index file.\r\n\r\nFor the sortShuffleWriter and unsafe shuffle writer, there is only one partitionedFile for a shuffleMapTask, so the compution of digests(compute the digests for each partition depend on the indexs of this partitionedFile) is  cheap.\r\n\r\nFor the bypassShuffleWriter, the reduce partitions is little than byPassMergeThreshold, so the cost of digests compution is acceptable.\r\n\r\nDuring shuffle read phase, the digest value will be passed with the block data.\r\n\r\nAnd we will recompute the digest of the data obtained to compare with the origin digest value.\r\nWhen recomputing the digest of data obtained, it only need an additional buffer(2048Bytes) for computing crc32 value.\r\nAfter recomputing, we will reset the obtained data inputStream, if it is markSupported we only need reset it, otherwise it is a fileSegmentManagerBuffer, we need recreate it.\r\n\r\nSo, I think this verification mechanism  proposed for shuffle transmitted data is efficient and complete.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull requesst?\r\nIf we set `hive.exec.stagingdir=.test-staging\\tmp`,\r\nBut the staging directory is still `.hive-staging` on Windows OS.\r\n\r\nReasons for failure:\r\nTest code:\r\n```\r\n val path = new Path(\"C:\\\\test\\\\hivetable\")\r\n  println(\"path.toString: \" + path.toString)\r\n  println(\"path.toUri.getPath: \" + path.toUri.getPath)\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n```\r\npath.toString: C:/test/hivetable\r\npath.toUri.getPath: /C:/test/hivetable\r\n```\r\n We can see that `path.toUri.getPath` has one more separator than `path.toString`,  and the separator is   ' / ',  not  ' \\ '\r\nSo `stagingPathName.stripPrefix(inputPathName).stripPrefix(File.separator).startsWith(\".\")` will return false\r\n## How was this

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSince SPARK-27274 deprecated Scala-2.11 at Spark 2.4.1, we need to test Scala-2.12 more.\r\nSince Kakfa 0.8 doesn't have Scala-2.12 artifacts, e.g., `org.apache.kafka:kafka_2.12:jar:0.8.2.1`, this PR aims to fix `test-dependencies.sh` script to understand Scala binary version.\r\n```\r\n$ dev/change-scala-version.sh 2.12\r\n\r\n$
