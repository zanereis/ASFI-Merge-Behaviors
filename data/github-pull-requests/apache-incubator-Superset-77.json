SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis PR is not meant to be merged just yet - currently only here for discussion.\r\n\r\nRight now the ECharts area chart doesn't stack by default, often leading to confusion as many users expect area charts to be stacked. This PR changes the default behavior to set stacking to true when switching to the ECharts area chart. In addition, we currently don't support stacking on the ECharts line chart, which is in line with how Google Sheets does it. Incidentally, \"Area Chart\" and \"Stacked Area Chart\" are two separate chart types both ton Google Sheets and Excel. This is also the case for bar charts. See screenshot from Google Sheets:\r\n<img width=\"284\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/154437570-6876ea38-4d29-498b-a211-0e0f6f4e05aa.png\">\r\n\r\nSo a follow-up question is, would it be more intuitive to have separate stacking charts, or should stacking be a control in the parent chart?\r\n\r\nA few options come to mind:\r\n\r\nOption 1: Maintain the current status quo:\r\n- Line charts can't be stacked\r\n- Stacking in area and bar charts default to false\r\n- When setting stacking to true and moving from area to bar chart, the bars appear stacked.\r\n\r\nOption 2: Introduce separate chart types for the stacking variants:\r\n- Area Chart\r\n- Stacked Area Chart (new)\r\n- Bar Chart\r\n- Stacked Bar Chart (new)\r\n- Line Chart\r\n- Stacked Line Chart (new)\r\n- etc\r\n\r\nUnfortunately we now have to rerun the query whenever switching between these charts that have fully compatible query sections. So we should also consider creating a mechanism that rerenders the chart when switching between charts that are known to have compatible query sections (for instance all charts that share the same `buildQuery` callback).\r\n\r\nOption 3: Assume that stacking is an inherent viz type option that should be reset to its default when going between chart types:\r\n- Area Chart (stacking = true?)\r\n- Bar Chart (stacking = false?)\r\n- Line Chart (stacking unavailable? or add stacking and default to false?)\r\n\r\n### Video\r\nThis demonstrates option 2:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/154436935-70448695-3b56-4c15-9cc2-1aa165f33e50.mp4\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

contributing some new maps to the legacy country map visualization in #18745, I realized a few limitations, that this PR intends to address, i.e.:\r\n\r\n- Support a new source to download high-quality geoJSON boundary files, the amazing [geoBoundaries](https://www.geoboundaries.org/index.html) - in particular, this source supports up to 4 levels of administrative divisions (whereas the current source only supports 1), thanks to a new python notebook\r\n- Support for an attribution in the map display\r\n- Better naming convention for map names, e.g. capitalizing every word in names with spaces\r\n- A bunch of new maps coming from geoBoundaries relevant to my organization, with several administrative subdivision levels\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nTechnical / design choices and caveats:\r\n\r\n- The attributions comment displayed in the map is read from the GeoJSON source's `attribution` property at the top level of the `FeatureCollection`.\r\n- __WARNING__: Many admin areas do not have an ISO code... The geoBoundaries datasource's ID is used instead, but it requires the user to know about these. Further improvements might be needed to allow the use of the area name instead, or make it easier to discover the expected codes...\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nSample map for Kenya Counties (notice the new attribution comment at the bottom):\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59641363/154420759-1ce55b63-1f27-4162-a5b8-523337d5e397.png)\r\n\r\nSnapshot of all the added geojson

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nIf you have Superset open in the background and your session expires, the frontend will still display the logged-in state until the next request happens to fire, jarringly sending you all of a sudden to the login page.\r\n\r\nUntil now.\r\n\r\nThis code listens for the document's `visibilitychange` event. When the tab is focused, a request is made to the new `/api/v1/me/` endpoint, which returns 401 if the user is not logged in. The SupersetClient detects the 401 and sends the user to the login page.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1858430/154383754-abbf602a-543d-4fd1-b775-d3d795370a27.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n\r\nOpen Superset in two tabs. Log out of one tab. Switch to the other tab. It will immediately redirect to the login page.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing

couple of issues related to CSV upload:\r\n\r\n1. If the schema was overprescribed (both explicitly and in the table name) the flashed message would fail (resulting in a 500 error) due to invalid field names passed to the message generator. This code path was not covered by unit tests.\r\n2. The schema was not correctly extracted when specified in the table name.\r\n\r\nI debated how best to tackle this and initially went down the route of redefining the server-side form post logic (with unit tests), but opted for hopefully an easier/cleaner route by adding form validators.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n<img width=\"921\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-02-18 at 6

SUMMARY\r\nThis adds docs for reserved/supported URL parameters in the dashboard view. While writing docs for the Dashboard URL params, I noticed some inconsistencies in how they work:\r\n- The return type for `getUrlParam` was missing `null` which it defaults to when the param is missing\r\n- There was no way to disable native filters via URL params the same way that the dashboard metadata flag `show_native_filters` does. Here we recycle the `show_filters` URL param to mimic the behavior of `show_native_filters`.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Go to a dashboard with no native filters and set `expand_filters=1` on the URL to forcefully expand the Filter Bar: http://35.86.100.235:8080/superset/dashboard/10/?expand_filters=1\r\n2. Go to a dashboard with at least 1 native filter and set `expand_filters=0` on the URL to forcefully collapse the Filter Bar: http://35.86.100.235:8080/superset/dashboard/10/?expand_filters=0\r\n3. Go to a dashboard and set `show_filters=0` to forcefully disable native filters (handy for standalone mode): http://35.86.100.235:8080/superset/dashboard/10/?show_filters=0\r\n4. Go to the \"Video Game Sales\" dashboard and set `standalone=0` to verify that it looks like the default configuration: http://35.86.100.235:8080/superset/dashboard/5/?standalone=0\r\n5. Set `standalone=1` to see that the top nav is removed: http://35.86.100.235:8080/superset/dashboard/5/?standalone=1\r\n6. Set `standalone=2` to see that the top nav + title is removed: http://35.86.100.235:8080/superset/dashboard/5/?standalone=2\r\n7. Set `standalone=3` to see that the top nav + title + top tabs are removed: http://35.86.100.235:8080/superset/dashboard/5/?standalone=3\r\n8. Set `standalone=3&show_filters=0` to make sure filter bar, nav, title and top tabs are removed: http://35.86.100.235:8080/superset/dashboard/5/?standalone=3&show_filters=0\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL

SUMMARY\r\nRewrite of https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui/pull/1303 by @villebro.\r\n\r\nWhen going from the dashboard to Explore view with extra filters (native filters or filter box), the filters are only appended to the first query. In this PR we add the first query's adhoc filters that have isExtra set to true.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore: \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/154064785-e33bc567-eee9-4ca2-be4d-06554801d0e7.png)\r\n\r\nAfter: \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/154064821-c95a027d-7682-41f0-ab78-29ccb12b6c4b.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Create a mixed timeseries chart and add it to a dashboard\r\n2. Go to that dashboard and apply some native filters\r\n3. Click View chart in explore on mixed timeseries chart\r\n4. Verify that native filter is applied in both Query A and Query B adhoc filter control\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes

But for report schedule, it has `owners` in `related_field_filters`, not `created_by`.

href=\"https://github.com/handlebars-lang/handlebars.js/blob/master/release-notes.md#v460---january-8th-2020\">4.6.0</a> now also apply\nin when using the compile-option &quot;strict: true&quot;. Access to prototype properties is forbidden completely by default, specific properties or methods\ncan be allowed via runtime-options. See <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/wycats/handlebars.js/issues/1633\">#1633</a> for details. If you are using Handlebars as documented, you should not be accessing prototype properties\nfrom your template anyway, so the changes should not be a problem for you. Only the use of undocumented features can break your build.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That is why we only bump the patch version despite mentioning breaking changes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/handlebars-lang/handlebars.js/compare/v4.7.6...v4.7.7\">Commits</a></p>\n<h2>v4.7.6 - April 3rd, 2020</h2>\n<p>Chore/Housekeeping:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/handlebars-lang/handlebars.js/issues/1672\">#1672</a> - Switch cmd parser to latest minimist (<a href=\"https://api.github.com/users/dougwilson\"><code>@​dougwilson</code></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Compatibility notes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Restored Node.js compatibility</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/handlebars-lang/handlebars.js/compare/v4.7.5...v4.7.6\">Commits</a></p>\n<h2>v4.7.5 - April 2nd, 2020</h2>\n<p>Chore/Housekeeping:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><del>Node.js version support has been changed to v6+</del> Reverted in 4.7.6</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Compatibility notes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><del>Node.js &lt; v6 is no longer supported</del> Reverted in 4.7.6</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/handlebars-lang/handlebars.js/compare/v4.7.4...v4.7.5\">Commits</a></p>\n<h2>v4.7.4 - April 1st, 2020</h2>\n<p>Chore/Housekeeping:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/handlebars-lang/handlebars.js/issues/1666\">#1666</a> - Replaced minimist with yargs for handlebars CLI (<a href=\"https://api.github.com/users/aorinevo\"><code>@​aorinevo</code></a>, <a href=\"https://api.github.com/users/AviVahl\"><code>@​AviVahl</code></a> &amp; <a href=\"https://api.github.com/users/fabb\"><code>@​fabb</code></a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Compatibility notes:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

SUMMARY\r\nSpark removed date format string 'u' in Spark 3.0 [[0]] so the grain expressions need to be updated because ones that depend on that format string are failing 😢.

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nBoth PyHive and `sqlalchemy-trino` declare a `trino://` SQLAlchemy dialect. If you create a database in Superset with the `trino://` SQLAlchemy URI and have both libraries installed the backend will use one the library randomly on every request, making it impossible to connect to a Trino database.\r\n\r\nI created a PR upstream renaming the PyHive dialect to `trino+pyhive://` (https://github.com/dropbox/PyHive/pull/428), so that `trino://` resolves unambiguously. In the meantime, this PR adds a `trinonative://` entry pointing directly to the `sqlalchemy-trino` dialect, so that users with both libraries installed can connect to Trino.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nI propose to pin version of Superset in Chart. \r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nThere are several reasons for this:\r\n- during the restart of the pod, no automatic update is performed, which may potentially damage the user's data (backup must be performed before the update, etc.) or affect the availability of the application,\r\n- new versions of the Superset may require an adaptation of the Superset,\r\n- old versions of Helm Chart will be known to correctly run old versions of Superset,\r\n\r\nThe downside is that we need to update the Chart and release it in order for users to use the new versions. Currently, however, releases are automated, and verification of the new Superset release that it is compatible with the Chart is even advisable.\r\n\r\nIn the future, we can think of an automatic version update when the Superset version is changed. For this, the e2e Superset tests could be useful, perhaps taking into account the update process as well.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nI deployed an updated Chart and verified if pods started and inspected created manifests.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue

SUMMARY\r\n\r\n- Adds/fixes sorting for results with more than 50 columns\r\n- Adds third sort state that clears the sort and returns list to its initial order\r\n- Adds a little more padding for the sorting icons because they were being truncated on some headers\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Sorting\r\n\r\nIn SQL Lab there is currently no sorting for data with more than 50 columns because `FilterableTable` switches from using the react-virtualized `Table` to the react-virtualized `Grid`. [Grid](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-virtualized/blob/master/docs/Grid.md) isn't set up to have sorting the way that [Table](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-virtualized/blob/master/docs/Table.md) is.\r\n\r\nThe UI is the same as far as the user can tell so the sorting appears to stop working when there are too many columns.\r\n\r\nI added listeners to the grid headers and added a `displayedList` state that gets sorted and used by the grid cells when rendering. I used the `SortIndicator` icon component and used the same `sortBy` and `sortDirection` state that the `Table` uses. They are never rendered at the same time so it didn't feel necessary to give the Grid its own separate states.\r\n\r\nFor the same reason I slightly changed the `renderTable` method to use the new `displayedList` state as well. \r\n\r\nThis allows the initial list to remain intact because it is now doing \"out of place\" sorting instead of \"in place\" sorting. This allowed me to add a third cleared sort state that reverts the sorting back to before it was sorted.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Third Sort State (Cleared Sort State)\r\n\r\nAdded a third sorting state to FilterableTable that will return the results to its original order. As far as I know, this was not requested anywhere but I added it because I was in the area.\r\n\r\nThis is done by having an initial list and a displayed list and only mutating the displayed list when sorting. Then we just set the list back to its initial state when we have already sorted by descending and ascending. \r\n\r\nThe logic and flow is simple enough\r\n\r\nThe current sorting flow is:\r\n- Original list order\r\n- Click -> Ascending list order\r\n- Click -> Descending list order\r\n- Click -> Ascending list order\r\n\r\nThis PR will change it to:\r\n- Original list order\r\n- Click -> Ascending list order\r\n- Click -> Descending list order\r\n- Click -> Original list order\r\n\r\n**Logic:**\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nsort({\r\n    sortBy,\r\n    sortDirection,\r\n  }: {\r\n    sortBy: string;\r\n    sortDirection: SortDirectionType;\r\n  }) {\r\n    this.setState(\r\n      ({\r\n        sortBy: prevSortBy,\r\n        sortDirection: prevSortDirection,\r\n        displayedList: prevDisplayedList,\r\n      }) => {\r\n        const shouldClearSort =\r\n          prevSortDirection === SortDirection.DESC && prevSortBy === sortBy;\r\n        if (shouldClearSort)\r\n          return {\r\n            sortBy: undefined,\r\n            sortDirection: undefined,\r\n            displayedList: [...this.list],\r\n          };\r\n\r\n        return {\r\n          sortBy,\r\n          sortDirection,\r\n          displayedList: prevDisplayedList.sort(\r\n            this.sortResults(sortBy, sortDirection === SortDirection.DESC),\r\n          ),\r\n        };\r\n      },\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Extra Padding\r\n\r\nIncreases the constant for the default padding on cells from `40` to `50`\r\n\r\nThe sorting icon was being truncated on some cells so I added a little more padded to fix it. \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\n\r\n**Example of clicking on headers in table with >50 columns**\r\n\r\n![Screen Recording BEFORE 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31329271/153471540-01261bbd-d648-410c-8b90-c3c24bfecf33.gif)\r\n\r\n**Example of sorting on tables <50 columns**\r\n\r\n![Screen Recording BEFORE 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31329271/153471546-56908c68-2169-475d-a9bc-26f0cc1843b1.gif)\r\n\r\n**Examples of headers being truncated after triggering sorting**\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2022-02-10 at 11 17 08 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31329271/153471580-14637c33-97fc-4e65-8f0e-fe90baed9bfc.png)\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2022-02-10 at 11 17 19 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31329271/153471590-b67b5efd-a167-4830-9db6-b51789cc36ff.png)\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\n\r\n**Example of clicking on headers in table with >50 columns**\r\n\r\n![Screen Recording AFTER](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31329271/153470023-09ff67a6-b78b-4a78-8ad5-0b9eacd9ccf2.gif)\r\n\r\n**Examples of headers not being truncated after triggering sorting**\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2022-02-10 at 11 18 43 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31329271/153471598-2a53a3ab-bb5f-4b35-894e-64a4661445c6.png)\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2022-02-10 at 11 19 12 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31329271/153471611-ebdc1351-b6a4-4ce1-9639-565abfbc3c45.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis problem only exists in dev environments. The reason is the react-hot-loader will use \"ProxyFacade\", which is a wrapper for Functional Component. \r\n\r\n```\r\nProxyFacade = function(props, context) {\r\n      /*\r\n\r\n        ! THIS IS NOT YOUR COMPONENT !\r\n        !  THIS IS REACT-HOT-LOADER  !\r\n\r\n        And you are probably looking for a function component of yours\r\n        It's hidden, but there is a way to fix this - just reconfigure your application a bit\r\n        see https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader/issues/1311\r\n\r\n       */\r\n\r\n      const result = CurrentComponent(props, context);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd we use`recurseReactClone` method to create component(see https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset-frontend/src/CRUD/utils.js), which will pass props to the component. In this case, since the name has been changed, it is not possible to pass `onChange` props. see screenshot:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11830681/153377996-ae70e19a-7e49-4a08-87a3-f09684c995c6.png)\r\n\r\nHere we use this solution. https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader/issues/1311\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n### befre\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/153366245-f733f6b6-c7c1-4322-b16a-91eb1d156b1c.mp4\r\n### after\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11830681/153376126-886fd66b-9bc1-4d32-bae8-86d1b256e04b.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nInit image (`busybox`) is hard-coded and not customizable via values as image. Some teams (including my team) uses alternative registry (like local image registry proxy). The suggested change is backward-compatible with previous deployment, cause default values are set to previous state.\r\n\r\nThe `initImage` has same spec as `image` and could be used like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  initImage:\r\n      repository: my-registry/busybox\r\n```\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n\r\nThe change could be tested by deploying chart without `initImage` and with overridden value.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nRedis with password was not supported out-of-the-box, so I've added this support in celery config in _helpers. When variable: `redis_password` in section: `supersetNode.connections` other version of config script is created during init.\r\n\r\nI've also updated quite ancient version of Redis helm chart in dependencies.\r\nUpdate process was performed according to this doc: https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/bitnami/redis/16.3.1\r\n\r\nI've also added small fix in documentation for helm chart. #18641 \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\nI've updated values.yaml json schema. `helm lint` command runs successfully. I've also checked helm templates if configs are generated without any missing/additional white space.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT:

SUMMARY\r\nWhen exporting a pivoted CSV for the Pivot v2 chart with columns or metrics that have a verbose name, the export fails. This adds the option of passing the `verbose_map` from the datasource to the `get_column_name` and `get_metric_name` util functions + adds some missing tests. Note that remapping the column names is usually not needed, hence mapping is optional.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Create a Pivot v2 using the FCC 2018 Survey example dataset\r\n2. Set the metric as the saved metric \"COUNT(*)\"\r\n3. Set the columns as \"Job location preference\"\r\n4. Set the rows as \"Willing to relocate\"\r\n5.

SUMMARY\r\nThe objective of this PR is to improve Explore handling when a `form_data_key` expires. Previously when a key expired, the user was presented with the following screen:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1777\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-02-08 at 2 08 40 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70410625/153038844-2c6cd365-8939-4108-86b9-a2fba02e8105.png\">\r\n\r\nTo avoid this situation this PR introduces two new query parameters called `slice_id` and `dataset_id`. These parameters are used when processing an Explore request in case the `form_data_key` is expired. In this scenario, we recover with the minimal information necessary to present the chart, dealing with both saved and unsaved charts.\r\n\r\nIn the video below I simulate a key expiration by disabling the cache and demonstrate the changes in the workflow:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70410625/153041998-2919104f-e206-4efa-851d-f28d4ff3d641.mov\r\n\r\n### TESTING

SUMMARY\r\nWhen functions are implemented, they have a specific reason and responsible for change (SRP)\r\nWriting logs is a different concern that is not related to the reason of the functions that logging statements were added to them. \r\nIn addition, writing logs imply code duplication (imagine writing the logs in the example)\r\nand remember, logging is a cross-cutting concern so adding logging behavior is best used as AOP \r\n\r\nThat PR adds a log decorator ability so you can decorate a function or class and you'll get logging out of the box.\r\n\r\nRight now as of POC I added and use it under tests. \r\nAfter adding the decorator, for each public method that is called, new log records will be added.\r\nIn case the logger is configured as DEBUG, for each method call (whether is private or public) a new log will be added with the passed arguments and return value.\r\n\r\n#### Example \r\n```python\r\n\r\nfrom tests.common.logger_utils import log\r\n\r\n@log\r\nclass PandasDataLoader(DataLoader):\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n@log\r\nclass TableToDfConvertorImpl(TableToDfConvertorI)\r\n   ...\r\n```\r\n```\r\nINFO

understand the code I recommend reading the post [decorators-and-closures-in-python\r\n](https://towardsdatascience.com/decorators-and-closures-by-example-in-python-382758321164)\r\n\r\nWhen the decorator is created, it takes the decorated class or function, extracts the logger defined inside the module containing the decorated (in case a logger was not defined, a new one will be created).\r\n\r\nwith the help of the builtin inspect library the decorator will decorate all the class functions members, then for each function, the inspect will parse the function signature and wrap the function with logs statements \r\n\r\n\r\n### Important notes\r\n- Right now Pytest captures all the logs, so you won't see them unless a test will be failed or configure pytest not to capture the logs. \r\n- You can configure different format messages parts by passing prefixes to the decorator. \r\n- When logging a class methods of function, the \"self\" and \"cls\" parameter are

SUMMARY\r\nFor charts that request more than one query, only the first result can be downloaded as CSV. This PR does the following:\r\n- When downloading a CSV, return a CSV file if there is only one result (current behavior), but return all results bundled in a ZIP file if there are more than one results. Also add a unit test to ensure that requesting a multi-query `QueryContext` returns a zip with the expected contents\r\n- If user tries to request CSV for a `QueryContext` with an empty `queries` property, return a 400. Also add a unit test for this case.\r\n- Add assertion for the `mimetype` to the pre-existing single result CSV integration test\r\n- Add assertion for the `mimetype` to the pre-existing JSON download integration test\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Create a Mixed Timeseries chart\r\n2. Click the \"Export to .CSV format\" button\r\n3. Verify that the downloaded ZIP file includes two CSVs with the correct contents\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\"

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR forces the `colorScale` to return a different color when the same metrics are found across the two queries in order to apply contrasting colors. It appends a `(1)` to the name of the metric in series B when found in series A so that the `colorScale` will treat it as a different value and it behaves consistently with how the chart renames these labels.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60598000/152832268-17552fbb-5bdd-4abc-ae8c-f6b347bb4bce.mp4\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60598000/153009181-8161365e-e0cc-4fe2-a477-5db853b2f272.mp4\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\n1. Choose a mixed time-series chart\r\n2. Date added in Time with a Grain: Month\r\n3. Add the same metrics A and B\r\n4. Customize -> Create 1 metric as a Line and the other as a Bar\r\n5.

SUMMARY\r\nWhen running Jest tests on the frontend, I noticed that it was triggering Cypress, too (which obviously were failing).
