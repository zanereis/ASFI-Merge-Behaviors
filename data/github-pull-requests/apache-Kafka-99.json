AlterConfigs\r\n  2. IncrementalAlterConfigs\r\n  3. AlterClientQuotas\r\n  4. CreateTopics\r\n\r\nThe specific changes include:\r\n\r\n1. Use the flag `RequestContext.fromPrivilegedListener` to indicate whether a request is **possibly** coming from the inter broker communication, details in this [PR](https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/9144). When a request is from a privileged listener, we would do a separate round of `CLUSTER_ACTION` authorization for a forwarding request.\r\n\r\n2. Add initial principal name and initial client id to the request header for audit logging and throttling during request forwarding. Note that initial principal name should not be used for authorization purpose.\r\n\r\n3. Add checks for forward request. The criteria is based on:\r\n  3.1 whether the request is from a privileged listener\r\n  3.2 whether the request header is equipped with initial principal name and initial client id.\r\n\r\n4. Add a separate authorization of a forward request when the original authorization fails. Broker will authorize the request with CLUSTER_ACTION separately.\r\n\r\n5. Checks for the mentioned RPCs to do the redirection. Will do the forwarding when the request is not forwarded and the current broker is not the controller.\r\n\r\n6. Add broker IBP to guard against redirection. If IBP is low, any broker would still try to mutate ZK data with admin manager.\r\n\r\n7. Bump AlterConfigs and AlterClientQuotas version by 1 to enable flexible versions for redirection fields in header.\r\n\r\nWe also built a template called `ForwardRequestHandler` to formulate the workflow of forward request handling. To make sure it works, we choose to firstly migrate the multi-resource RPCs such as AlterConfigs and CreateTopics.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design

Greg Harris <gregh@confluent.io>\r\n\r\nCurrently, the system tests `connect_distributed_test` and `connect_rest_test` only wait for the REST api to come up.\r\nThe startup of the worker includes an asynchronous process for joining the worker group and syncing with other workers.\r\nThere are some situations in which this sync takes an unusually long time, and the test continues without all workers up.\r\nThis leads to flakey test failures, as worker joins are not given sufficient time to timeout and retry without waiting explicitly.\r\n\r\nThis changes the ConnectDistributedTest to wait for the `Joined group` message to be printed to the logs before continuing with tests. I've activated this behavior by default, as it's a superset of the checks that were performed by default before.\r\n\r\nThis log message is present in every version of DistributedHerder that I could find, in slightly different forms, but always with `Joined group` at the beginning of the log message. This change should be safe to backport to any branch.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI

fixed a consistency issue with the transaction timeout and the progress timeout. Since the test case relies on transaction timeouts, we need to wait at last as long as the timeout in order to ensure progress. However, having a low transaction timeout makes the test prone to the issue identified in KAFKA-9802, in which the coordinator timed out the transaction while the producer was awaiting a `Produce` response.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation

change makes use of the generated protocols for FetchRequest and FetchResponse. The main challenge here was how to allow the transferrable bytes of the record set to be directly sent to the outgoing response without copying into a buffer. \r\n\r\nThe proposed solution is similar to the existing multi-send object used in [FetchResponse](https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/9008/files#diff-703009e7d02b102b24c03145c2e0e170). However, a new writer class [RecordsWriter](https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/9008/files#diff-779905aabf500cf13753614066c9d316) was introduced to allow interleaving of ByteBufferSend (for headers and other non-record fields) along with RecordsSend-s which implement the efficient byte transfer.\r\n\r\nAnother change introduced here is that FetchRequest and FetchResponse do not maintain their own copies of the fields from the message. Instead, they hold a reference to the generated message class (FetchRequestData and FetchResponseData). Read-only copies of different forms of the message data are created once open construction to allow for efficient access using the existing class methods.\r\n\r\nFor example, in FetchRequest we hold the FetchRequestData, but also compute and hold:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    private final FetchRequestData fetchRequestData;\r\n\r\n    // These are immutable read-only structures derived from FetchRequestData\r\n    private final Map<TopicPartition, PartitionData> fetchData;\r\n    private final List<TopicPartition> toForget;\r\n    private final FetchMetadata metadata;\r\n``` \r\n\r\nAnd in FetchResponse, we similarly hold:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    private final FetchResponseData fetchResponseData;\r\n    private final LinkedHashMap<TopicPartition, PartitionData<T>> responseDataMap;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we want, we could deprecate all the accessors on FetchRequest/FetchResponse and force callers to use the `#data()` method. This would eliminate the need for these additional data structures.\r\n\r\nFinally, most of the other changes are fixing up tests that were actually using invalid default values for protocol messages (which are now enforced, thanks to the generated classes) as well as rectifying the JSON schema to match what the actual defined `Schema`s were (e.g., FETCH_RESPONSE_V11)","created_at":"2020-07-10T17:50:50Z","updated_at":"2020-07-30T17:29:40Z","closed_at":"2020-07-30T17:29:40Z","merged_at":"2020-07-30T17:29:40Z","merge_commit_sha":"4cd2396db31418c90005c998d9107ad40df055b2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/9008/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/9008/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/9008/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/507eb047ba0f652f7781d80e35c8d8c262ccb9f5","head":{"label":"mumrah:KAFKA-9629-fetch-api-generated-protocol","ref":"KAFKA-9629-fetch-api-generated-protocol","sha":"507eb047ba0f652f7781d80e35c8d8c262ccb9f5","user":{"login":"mumrah","id":55116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah","html_url":"https://github.com/mumrah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":5542805,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NTQyODA1","name":"kafka","full_name":"mumrah/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mumrah","id":55116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah","html_url":"https://github.com/mumrah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mumrah/kafka","description":"Mirror

benign `WakeupException` can be thrown by a sink task's consumer if the task is scheduled for shutdown by the worker. This is caught and handled gracefully if the exception is thrown when calling `poll` on the consumer, but not if calling `commitSync`, which is invoked by a task during shutdown and also when its partition assignment is updated.\r\n\r\nIf thrown during a partition assignment update, the `WakeupException` is caught and handled gracefully as part of the task's `iteration` loop. If thrown during shutdown, however, it is not caught and instead leads to the scary-looking log message \"Task threw an uncaught and unrecoverable exception. Task is being killed and will not recover until manually restarted.\".\r\n\r\nThese changes catch the `WakeupException` during shutdown and handle it gracefully with a `TRACE`-level log message.\r\n\r\nA unit test is added to verify this behavior by simulating a thrown `WakeupException` during `Consumer::commitSync`, running through the `WorkerSinkTask::execute` method, and confirming that it does not throw a `WakeupException` itself.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2020-07-09T17:11:01Z","updated_at":"2020-11-09T15:35:53Z","closed_at":"2020-07-14T03:55:13Z","merged_at":"2020-07-14T03:55:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"4cd6dfc825b934e8e360bdd586c41931b0b3b8e6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":851037639,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTEwMzc2Mzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/connect","name":"connect","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/9003/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/9003/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/9003/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/ba03f7ee746dade491558bd66111407c98b71470","head":{"label":"C0urante:kafka-10240","ref":"kafka-10240","sha":"ba03f7ee746dade491558bd66111407c98b71470","user":{"login":"C0urante","id":8636148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2MzYxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8636148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante","html_url":"https://github.com/C0urante","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":83460713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MzQ2MDcxMw==","name":"kafka","full_name":"C0urante/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"C0urante","id":8636148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2MzYxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8636148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante","html_url":"https://github.com/C0urante","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/C0urante/kafka","description":"Mirror

this PR, I have implemented the write path of the feature versioning system (KIP-584).  Here is a summary of what's in this PR:\r\n - New APIs in `org.apache.kafka.clients.admin.Admin` interface, and their client and server implementations. These APIs can be used to describe features and update finalized features. These APIs are: `Admin#describeFeatures` and `Admin#updateFeatures`.\r\n    - The write path is provided by the `Admin#updateFeatures` API. The corresponding server-side implementation is provided in `KafkaApis` and `KafkaController` classes. This can be a good place to start the code review.\r\n    - The write path is supplemented by `Admin#describeFeatures` client API. This does not translate 1:1 to a server-side API. Instead, under the hood the API makes an explicit `ApiVersionsRequest` to the Broker to fetch the supported and finalized features.\r\n - Implemented a suite of integration tests in `UpdateFeaturesTest.scala` that thoroughly exercises the various cases in the write path.\r\n\r\n**Other changes:**\r\n - The data type of the `FinalizedFeaturesEpoch` field in `ApiVersionsResponse` has been modified from `int32` to `int64`. This change is to conform with the latest changes to the KIP explained in the voting thread (see [this link](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rf7fb6a033638c43a338be5cc316e9e69df6e2589fab66b69d8b67f0f%40%3Cdev.kafka.apache.org%3E)).\r\n - Along the way, the class `SupportedFeatures` has been renamed to be called `BrokerFeatures`, and, it now holds both supported features as well as default minimum version levels.\r\n - For the purpose of testing, both the `BrokerFeatures` and `FinalizedFeatureCache` classes have been changed to be no longer singleton in implementation. Instead, these are now instantiated once and maintained in `KafkaServer`. The singleton instances are passed around to various classes, as needed.\r\n\r\n**Test plan:**\r\n - Relying on existing and unit and integration tests added in this PR.","created_at":"2020-07-09T10:50:51Z","updated_at":"2020-10-08T09:26:13Z","closed_at":"2020-10-07T17:23:17Z","merged_at":"2020-10-07T17:23:17Z","merge_commit_sha":"fb4f297207ef62f71e4a6d2d0dac75752933043d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":838330122,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MzgzMzAxMjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/core","name":"core","color":"ed5a86","default":false,"description":"Kafka

That raises an `ConcurrentModificationException` exception. The current unit test did not catch this because it was using only one node.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify

Ideas:\r\n\r\n1) Add a separate StateRestoreThread which is responsible for restore active / update standby tasks. Having N restore threads with N stream threads, with a 1-1 mapping just because it makes the synchronization simpler and we can keep the number of restore consumer the same.\r\n\r\n2) Extract the StoreChangelogReader from all other classes (TaskManager, StreamThread) to be solely owned by this thread only, and hence the reader can still be non thread-safe. The communication between the two threads are just two concurrent queues: a) for sending new / closed tasks that should be registered / deregistered at the restore thread, and b) for letting the restore thread to communicate task corruption exception to the main thread to handle it.\r\n\r\n3) There are a bunch of tricky things that I'd have to nudge around, which I've also highlighted in the comments below.\r\n\r\n4) Updated unit tests, making some refactoring as well.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2020-07-06T20:53:32Z","updated_at":"2022-06-15T00:02:37Z","closed_at":"2022-06-15T00:02:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a4be9649c3fc240a0499e33a7864ade3958fa110","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/8988/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/8988/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/8988/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/a7e52133e5d362d56e5909870b8b171b29c796ec","head":{"label":"guozhangwang:K10199-separate-restore-threads","ref":"K10199-separate-restore-threads","sha":"a7e52133e5d362d56e5909870b8b171b29c796ec","user":{"login":"guozhangwang","id":10729597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzI5NTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10729597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":39164613,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTE2NDYxMw==","name":"kafka","full_name":"guozhangwang/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"guozhangwang","id":10729597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzI5NTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10729597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang/kafka","description":"Mirror

have noticed that `alterReplicaLogDirs` fails all the unrealised futures when one of the call sent out fails (e.g. timeout). So if two calls A and B are sent out, if A fails before B comes back, all the futures are failed even if B is successful. I think that each call should realised their related futures only.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a unit test to reproduce the issue and fix it.\r\n\r\nIt seems that other calls may suffer from the same issue.

currently return NOT_LEADER_FOR_PARTITION to producers and REPLICA_NOT_AVAILABLE to consumers if a replica is not available on the broker during reassignments. Non-Java clients treat REPLICA_NOT_AVAILABLE as a non-retriable exception, Java consumers handle this error by explicitly matching the error code even though it is not an InvalidMetadataException. This PR renames `NOT_LEADER_FOR_PARTITION` to `NOT_LEADER_OR_FOLLOWER` and uses the same error for producers and consumers. This is compatible with both Java and non-Java clients since all clients handle this error code (6) as retriable exception. The PR also makes ReplicaNotAvailableException a subclass of InvalidMetadataException.\r\n\r\n- ALTER_REPLICA_LOG_DIRS continues to return REPLICA_NOT_AVAILABLE. Retained this for compatibility since this request never returned NOT_LEADER_FOR_PARTITION earlier.  Did not  deprecate ReplicaNotAvailableException because of this.\r\n- MetadataRequest  version 0 also returns REPLICA_NOT_AVAILABLE for compatibility. Newer versions filter these out and\r\n return Errors.NONE, so didn't change this.\r\n- Partition responses in MetadataRequest return REPLICA_NOT_AVAILABLE to indicate that one of the replicas is not available.

PR does two things:\r\n\r\n1. It introduces `QuotaEnforcementType` which allows to choose when the quota enforcement is done within the `Sensor`. The default `Permissive` mode works as previously. It enforces the quota after having accounted the new value. The new `Strict` mode enforces the quota before and thus does not account the value if the quota is violated.\r\n\r\n2. It introduces a new `SampledStat` named `TokenBucket`. Our current quota enforcement mechanism does not cope well with bursty workloads, especially when the burst is significantly larger than the quota. The reason is that a large recorded burst remains in the samples until it gets pasted the window. During this time, the computed rate remains the same until it gets dropped. The `TokenBucket` sampled stat alleviate this issue by decreasing each sample by Quota * the time between itself and the previous sample. This mimics the token bucket algorithm which gives back credits at every second.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2020-07-03T10:20:16Z","updated_at":"2020-10-06T20:08:26Z","closed_at":"2020-07-27T14:14:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cfb0f10dc9d528426e0f9e2875d0229a3180aa14","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/8977/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/8977/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/8977/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/19e7180105c366d245183644c823135fb2872571","head":{"label":"dajac:KIP-599-part-3","ref":"KIP-599-part-3","sha":"19e7180105c366d245183644c823135fb2872571","user":{"login":"dajac","id":157182,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NzE4Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/157182?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac","html_url":"https://github.com/dajac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":40044750,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MDA0NDc1MA==","name":"kafka","full_name":"dajac/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dajac","id":157182,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NzE4Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/157182?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac","html_url":"https://github.com/dajac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dajac/kafka","description":"Mirror

added a `canReadConfigs` field to the `DistributedHerder` a while back that gets set to `false` if the herder fails to catch up to the end of the config topic, but never gets set to `true` again if catchup succeeds at a later point.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds logic to reset it to `true` when it's safe to.\r\n\r\nA single unit test is tweaked to ensure that the herder doesn't keep unnecessarily trying to catch up to the end of the config topic during every tick.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and

in progress,  appreciate any feedback on my initial approach. \r\n\r\nAdding a disconnect status to Kafka streams. This is achieved by introducing by recording fetch disconnectedExceptions in Fetcher and then measuring them through 2 new metrics _fetchRequestSuccessPercent_ and\r\n_fetchRequestFailurePercent_. Currently when the percentage of failed fetches is above an arbitrary threshold we transition the streamThread to a disconnected state. Then when percentage of failed fetches dips below another arbitrary threshold we transition the streamThread to it's previous state. \r\n\r\nIf my approach is satisfactory, I'll start writing tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation

Kafka Streams the source-of-truth of a state store is in its changelog, therefore when committing a state store we only need to make sure its changelog records are all flushed and committed, but we do not actually need to make sure that the materialized state have to be flushed and persisted since they can always be restored from changelog when necessary.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, flushing a state store too frequently may have side effects, e.g. rocksDB flushing would gets the memtable into an L0 sstable, leaving many small L0 files to be compacted later, which introduces larger overhead.\r\n\r\nTherefore this PR decouples flushing from committing, such that we do not always flush the state store upon committing, but only when sufficient data has been written since last time flushed. The checkpoint file would then also be overwritten only along with flushing the state store indicating its current known snapshot. This is okay since: a) if EOS is not enabled, then it is fine if the local persisted state is actually ahead of the checkpoint, b) if EOS is enabled, then we would never write a checkpoint file until close.\r\n\r\nHere's a more detailed change list of this PR:\r\n\r\n1. Do not always flush state stores when calling pre-commit; move `stateMgr.flush` into post-commit to couple together with checkpointing. \r\n\r\n2. In post-commit, we checkpoint when: a) The state store's snapshot has progressed much further compared to the previous checkpoint, b) When the task is being closed (but as a minor optimization, we would avoid checkpointing on closing if it is exactly the same as the previous one).\r\n\r\n3. There are some tricky obstacles that I'd have to work around in a bit hacky way: for cache / suppression buffer, we still need to flush them in pre-commit to make sure all records sent via producers, while the underlying state store should not be flushed. I've decided to introduce a new API in CachingStateStore to be triggered in pre-commit.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [

current failures we're seeing with this test are due to faulty assumptions that it makes and not any real bug in eos-beta (at least, from what I've seen so far).\r\n\r\nThe test relies on tightly controlling the commits, which it does by setting the commit interval to MAX_VALUE and manually requesting commits on the context. In two phases, the test assumes that any pending data will be committed after a rebalance. But we actually take care to avoid unnecessary commits -- with eos-alpha, we only commit tasks that are revoked while in eos-beta we must commit all tasks if any are revoked, but only if the revoked tasks themselves need a commit.\r\n\r\nThe failure we see occurs when we try to verify the committed data after a second client is started and the group rebalances. The already-running client has to give up two tasks to the newly started client, but those tasks may not need to be committed in which case none of the tasks would be. So we still have an open transaction on the partitions where we try to read committed data.\r\n\r\nWe can use a punctuator to force a commit on the running client

more edge cases I found producing extra TaskcorruptedException while playing around with the failing eos-beta upgrade test (sadly these are unrelated problems, as the test still fails with these fixes in place).\r\n\r\n1. Need to write the checkpoint when recycling a standby: although we do preserve the changelog offsets when recycling a task, and should therefore write the offsets when the new task is itself closed, we do NOT write the checkpoint for uninitialized tasks. So if the new task is ultimately closed before it gets out of the CREATED state, the offsets will not be written and we can get a TaskCorruptedException\r\n2. With the change in task locking to address some Windows-related nonsense (am I remembering that correctly?), we don't delete entire task directories but just clear the inner state. With EOS, during initialization we check if the state directory is non-empty and the checkpoint is missing, and throw a TaskCorrupted if so. But just opening a rocksdb store creates a `rocksdb` base dir in the task directory, so the `taskDirIsEmpty` check always fails and we always throw TaskCorrupted even if there's nothing there. We can fix this for rocksdb (and custom stores) by searching through the task directory for any actual contents: we just do a BFS looking for any file that isn't itself a directory or sst file specifically if rocksdb\r\n\r\nNote: fix 2 is not perfect but it helps. It's not a correctness issue, just an annoyance.","created_at":"2020-06-30T22:30:47Z","updated_at":"2020-07-07T19:12:03Z","closed_at":"2020-07-07T00:16:12Z","merged_at":"2020-07-07T00:16:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"cdf68a4dae284ef021ae4ed26c5e0128c0cd7224","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/8962/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/8962/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/8962/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/ca3274ffc9a1973ed7a4977889e257cc8fc8b67e","head":{"label":"ableegoldman:10166-checkpoint-recycled-standbys-and-ignore-rocksdb-dir","ref":"10166-checkpoint-recycled-standbys-and-ignore-rocksdb-dir","sha":"ca3274ffc9a1973ed7a4977889e257cc8fc8b67e","user":{"login":"ableegoldman","id":4843099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NDMwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4843099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman","html_url":"https://github.com/ableegoldman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":166325386,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjYzMjUzODY=","name":"kafka","full_name":"ableegoldman/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ableegoldman","id":4843099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NDMwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4843099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman","html_url":"https://github.com/ableegoldman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ableegoldman/kafka","description":"Mirror

this is a backport of (#7687) for 2.3.\r\n\r\nExisting producer state expiration uses timestamps from data records only and not from transaction markers. This can cause premature producer expiration when the coordinator times out a transaction because we drop the state from existing batches. This in turn can allow the coordinator epoch to revert to a previous value, which can lead to validation failures during log recovery. This patch fixes the problem by also leveraging the timestamp from transaction markers.\r\n\r\nWe also change the validation logic so that coordinator epoch is verified only for new marker appends. When replicating from the leader and when recovering the log, we only log a warning if we notice that the coordinator epoch has gone backwards. This allows recovery from previous occurrences of this bug.\r\n\r\nFinally, this patch fixes one minor issue when loading producer state from the snapshot file. When the only record for a given producer is a control record, the \"last offset\" field will be set to -1 in the snapshot. We should check for this case when loading to be sure we recover the state consistently.\r\n\r\nReviewers: Ismael Juma <ismael@juma.me.uk>, Guozhang Wang <wangguoz@gmail.com>\r\n\r\n### Committer
