What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAs reported, there is a sorting issue on relatively big datasets. This issue is not seen when using a smaller sized dataset.\r\n\r\nFor example, when trying to save a sorted dataset like:\r\n\r\n    val inpth = \"....\"\r\n    spark\r\n        .read\r\n        .option(\"inferSchema\", \"true\")\r\n        .option(\"header\", \"true\")\r\n        .csv(inpth)\r\n        .repartition($\"userId\")\r\n        .sortWithinPartitions(\"timestamp\")\r\n        .write\r\n        .partitionBy(\"userId\")\r\n        .option(\"header\", \"true\")\r\n        .csv(inpth + \"_sorted\")\r\n\r\nOn relatively big datasets, the data will not be sorted anymore after writing out.\r\n\r\nThat is because when we write partitioned dataset, we will use `UnsafeKVExternalSorter` to sort data before writing. It sorts data based on partition columns + bucketId + sortBy columns. The sort ordering of the data to write is not considered.\r\n\r\nEven in the above case where there is not bucket and sortBy, and data is already partitioned by \"userId\". In theory we won't change the order of data, but we still can't get correctly sorted data in output files on relatively big datasets. That is because if the data is big enough, `UnsafeKVExternalSorter` will spill data to files. When we merge the spilled files, we will interlace the readers of spilled files. Thus the order of data in the spilled files is not guaranteed, if we don't explicitly ask to sort on specified order.\r\n\r\n<del>\r\nThis change extends `UnsafeKVExternalSorter` to accept a `List[SortOrder]` parameter used to control how the keys are sorted. Then it considers the output ordering of the data to write when constructing the `UnsafeKVExternalSorter`.\r\n\r\nNote: one thing needs to discuss is when we have sortBy column with bucket, do we need to keep output sort ordering and how to do it? Should we sort by partition columns + bucketId + data sort ordering + sortBy columns? Or partition columns + bucketId + sort columns + data sort ordering?\r\n\r\n</del>\r\n\r\nWith the goal not to change or add implicit penalty to existing API, this patch solves the issue of preserving sort order of written data. After this patch, you can save sorted and partitioned data as:\r\n\r\n    spark\r\n        .read\r\n        .option(\"inferSchema\", \"true\")\r\n        .option(\"header\", \"true\")\r\n        .csv(inpth)\r\n        .repartition($\"userId\")\r\n        .sortWithinPartitions($\"userId\", \"timestamp\")  // Explicitly ask to sort by partition column(s)\r\n        .write\r\n        .partitionBy(\"userId\")\r\n        .option(\"header\", \"true\")\r\n        .csv(inpth + \"_sorted\")\r\n\r\nOnce the data to write is already sorted by the partition columns and no bucketing is specified, `FileFormatWriter` will not sort the data again. And the sort order is preserved in output files.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nJenkins tests.\r\n\r\nPlease review http://spark.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch adds support for sample weights to `DecisionTreeRegressor` and `DecisionTreeClassifier`. \r\n\r\n**Note:** This patch does not add support for sample weights to RandomForest. As discussed in the JIRA, we would like to add sample weights into the bagging process. This patch is large enough as is, and there are some additional considerations to be made for random forests. Since the machinery introduced here needs to be present regardless, I have opted to leave random forests for a follow up pr. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe algorithms are tested to ensure that:\r\n1. Arbitrary scaling of constant weights has no effect\r\n2. Outliers with small weights do not affect the learned model\r\n3. Oversampling and weighting are equivalent\r\n\r\nUnit tests are also added to test other smaller components.\r\n\r\n## Summary of changes\r\n\r\n* Impurity aggregators now store weighted sufficient statistics. They also store a raw count, however, since this is needed to use `minInstancesPerNode`. \r\n\r\n* Impurity aggregators now also hold the raw count.\r\n\r\n* This patch maintains the meaning of `minInstancesPerNode`, in that the parameter still corresponds to raw, unweighted counts. It also adds a new parameter `minWeightFractionPerNode` which requires that nodes must contain at least `minWeightFractionPerNode * weightedNumExamples` total weight.\r\n\r\n* This patch modifies `findSplitsForContinuousFeatures` to use weighted sums. Unit tests are added.\r\n\r\n* TreePoint is modified to hold a sample weight\r\n\r\n* BaggedPoint is modified from:\r\n\r\n````scala\r\nprivate[spark] class BaggedPoint[Datum](val datum: Datum, val subsampleWeights: Array[Double]) extends Serializable\r\n````\r\n\r\nto \r\n\r\n````scala\r\nprivate[spark] class BaggedPoint[Datum](\r\n    val datum: Datum,\r\n    val subsampleCounts: Array[Int],\r\n    val sampleWeight: Double) extends Serializable\r\n````\r\n\r\nWe do not simply multiply the counts by the weight and store that because we need the raw counts and the weight in order to use both `minInstancesPerNode` and `minWeightPerNode`\r\n\r\n**Note:** many of the changed files are due simply to using `Instance` instead of `LabeledPoint`\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-27T23:54:36Z","updated_at":"2019-01-07T13:28:52Z","closed_at":"2019-01-07T13:28:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d64736fdc2687d27b8eb1b38354c8e898f557d99","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16722/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16722/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16722/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/48b12586d2c24fd9852f9130376acd72d6e64467","head":{"label":"sethah:SPARK-9478-tree","ref":"SPARK-9478-tree","sha":"48b12586d2c24fd9852f9130376acd72d6e64467","user":{"login":"sethah","id":7275795,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNzU3OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7275795?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah","html_url":"https://github.com/sethah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":38016887,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODAxNjg4Nw==","name":"spark","full_name":"sethah/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sethah","id":7275795,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNzU3OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7275795?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah","html_url":"https://github.com/sethah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sethah/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n- this is cause by changes in SPARK-18444, SPARK-18643 that we no longer install Spark when `master = \"\"` (default), but also related to SPARK-18449 since the real `master` value is not known at the time the R code in `sparkR.session` is run. (`master` cannot default to \"local\" since it could be overridden by spark-submit commandline or spark config)\r\n- as a result, while running SparkR as a package in IDE is working fine, CRAN check is not as it is launching it via non-interactive script\r\n- fix is to add check to the beginning of each test and vignettes; the same would also work by changing `sparkR.session()` to `sparkR.session(master = \"local\")` in tests, but I think being more explicit is better.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTested this by reverting version to 2.1, since it needs to download the release jar with matching version. But since there are changes in 2.2 (specifically around SparkR ML) that are incompatible with 2.1, some tests are failing in this config. Will need to port this to branch-2.1 and retest with 2.1 release jar.\r\n\r\nmanually as:\r\n```\r\n# modify DESCRIPTION to revert version to 2.1.0\r\nSPARK_HOME=/usr/spark R CMD build pkg\r\n# run

Since every sub page (e.g. application UIs in the history\r\nserver) is a separate servlet context, this meant that everything\r\nbut the root was accessible via HTTP still.\r\n\r\nThe change adds separate names to each connector, and binds contexts\r\nto specific connectors so that content is only served through the\r\nHTTPS connector when it's enabled. In that case, the only thing that\r\nbinds to the HTTP connector is the redirect handler.\r\n\r\nTested with new unit tests and by checking a live history server.\r\n\r\n(cherry picked from commit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nStarting from Spark 2.0, task metrics are in the form of an accumulator. This is good but also causes excessive event logs because the metrics are logged twice (one under \"Accumulators\" and one under \"Task Metrics\"). For applications with lots of tasks, the size of event logs could be tens of GB and it is not feasible for Spark History Server to parse the logs and reconstruct the job UI. \r\n\r\nThis PR adds an option for EventLoggingListener not to log internal accumulators that are for task metrics. It also adds an option not to log \"Update Block Statuses\" metric that is quite verbose and might not be needed on some occasions. \r\n\r\nAfter updating to Spark 2.0, a size of the event log of some application with over 50k tasks jumped from ~ 1GB to over 40 GB. With this patch, the size of event logs became similar to the previous sizes with Spark 1.5.2.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests. Also run in

Since every sub page (e.g. application UIs in the history\r\nserver) is a separate servlet context, this meant that everything\r\nbut the root was accessible via HTTP still.\r\n\r\nThe change adds separate names to each connector, and binds contexts\r\nto specific connectors so that content is only served through the\r\nHTTPS connector when it's enabled. In that case, the only thing that\r\nbinds to the HTTP connector is the redirect handler.\r\n\r\nTested with new unit tests and by checking a live history server.\r\n\r\n(cherry picked from commit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn `ExpressionEncoder.toRow` and `fromRow`, we catch the exception and output `treeString` of serializer/deserializer expressions in the error message. However, encoder can be very complex and the serializer/deserializer expressions can be very large trees and blow up the log files(e.g. generate over 500mb logs for this single error message.) As a first attempt, this PR try to use `simpleString` instead.\r\n\r\n**BEFORE**\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nscala> :paste\r\n// Entering paste mode (ctrl-D to finish)\r\n\r\ncase class TestCaseClass(value:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nHive metastore is not case preserving and keep partition columns with lower case names. \r\n\r\nIf SparkSQL create a table with upper-case partion name use HiveExternalCatalog, when we rename partition, it first call the HiveClient to renamePartition, which will create a new lower case partition path, then SparkSql rename the lower case path to the upper-case.\r\n\r\nwhile if the renamed partition contains more than one depth partition ,e.g. A=1/B=2, hive renamePartition change to a=1/b=2, then SparkSql rename it to A=1/B=2, but the a=1 still exists in the filesystem, we should also delete it.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nunit test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd support for offset in GLM. This is useful for at least two reasons:\r\n\r\n1. Account for exposure: e.g., when modeling the number of accidents, we may need to use miles driven as an offset to access factors on frequency.    \r\n2. Test incremental effects of new variables: we can use predictions from the existing model as offset and run a much smaller model on only new variables. This avoids re-estimating the large model with all variables (old + new) and can be very important for efficient large-scaled analysis. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nNew test.\r\n\r\n@yanboliang @srowen @felixcheung @sethah

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nBefore this pr, LocalLimit/GlobalLimit/Sample propagates the same row count and column stats from its child, which is incorrect.\r\nWe can get the correct rowCount in Statistics for GlobalLimit/Sample whether cbo is enabled or not. \r\nWe don't know the rowCount for LocalLimit because we don't know the partition number at that time. Column stats should not be propagated because we don't know the distribution of columns after Limit or Sample.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to add the UPSERT feature support into SPARK through DataFrameWriter's JDBC data source options. \r\n\r\nFor example:\r\nIf the mytable2 in mysql database have unique constraints on column c1, and the user wants to save the dataframe into the mysql database, it will fail with violation of unique constraints.\r\n\r\n`val df = Seq((1,4)).toDF(\"c1\",\"c2\")`\r\n`val url = \"jdbc:mysql://9.30.167.220:3306/mydb\"`\r\n`df.write.mode(org.apache.spark.sql.SaveMode.Append)\r\n.option(\"user\",\"kevin\").option(\"password\",\"kevin\").jdbc(url,\"mytable2\",new java.util.Properties())`\r\n\r\nWith this feature, the user can use this UPSERT options to write the dataframe into the mysql database table.\r\n\r\n`df.write.mode(org.apache.spark.sql.SaveMode.Append)\r\n.option(“upsert”,true).option(“upsertUpdateColumn”,”c1”).option(\"user\",\"kevin\").option(\"password\",\"kevin\").jdbc(url,\"mytable2\",new

tested?\r\n\r\nLocal test: run the test case from spark-shell and connect to MySQL and Postgresql database\r\nTest case: add test cases in the existing test cases including docker integration suite\r\nPlease review http://spark.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull request.\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-24T11:58:35Z","updated_at":"2018-02-13T13:02:03Z","closed_at":"2017-06-27T12:17:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0cbb4603789822053147c97e00964e19e4a11da7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16692/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16692/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16692/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/25e5c83953abc9a02dfe3c9c1de3ac5515af5245","head":{"label":"kevinyu98:upsert2","ref":"upsert2","sha":"25e5c83953abc9a02dfe3c9c1de3ac5515af5245","user":{"login":"kevinyu98","id":7550280,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NTAyODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7550280?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinyu98","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":38393679,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODM5MzY3OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"kevinyu98/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kevinyu98","id":7550280,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NTAyODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7550280?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinyu98","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kevinyu98/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`ReceiverSupervisorImpl` on executor side reports block's meta back to `ReceiverTracker` on driver side. In current code, `askWithRetry` is used. However, for `AddBlock`, `ReceiverTracker` is not idempotent, which may result in messages are processed multiple times.\r\n\r\n**To reproduce**:\r\n\r\n1. Check if it is the first time receiving `AddBlock` in `ReceiverTracker`, if so sleep long enough(say 200 seconds), thus the first RPC call will be timeout in `askWithRetry`, then `AddBlock` will be resent.\r\n2. Rebuild Spark and run following job:\r\n```\r\n  def streamProcessing(): Unit = {\r\n    val conf = new SparkConf()\r\n      .setAppName(\"StreamingTest\")\r\n      .setMaster(masterUrl)\r\n    val ssc = new StreamingContext(conf, Seconds(200))\r\n    val stream = ssc.socketTextStream(\"localhost\", 1234)\r\n    stream.print()\r\n    ssc.start()\r\n    ssc.awaitTermination()\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n**To fix**:\r\n\r\nIt makes sense to provide a blocking version `ask` in RpcEndpointRef, as mentioned in SPARK-18113 (https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/16503#event-927953218). Because Netty RPC layer will not drop messages. `askWithRetry` is a leftover from akka days. It imposes restrictions on the caller(e.g. idempotency) and other things that people generally don't pay that much attention to when using it.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nTest manually. The scenario described above doesn't happen with this patch.","created_at":"2017-01-24T09:45:39Z","updated_at":"2017-02-17T02:18:18Z","closed_at":"2017-02-01T21:57:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"335efa23600651f7bcf6c06422675fdbe85786bd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16690/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16690/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16690/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/42eb540f8617ee3dc22c81014452896eedec97a3","head":{"label":"jinxing64:SPARK-19347","ref":"SPARK-19347","sha":"42eb540f8617ee3dc22c81014452896eedec97a3","user":{"login":"jinxing64","id":4058918,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNTg5MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4058918?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64","html_url":"https://github.com/jinxing64","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":78330400,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3ODMzMDQwMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"jinxing64/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jinxing64","id":4058918,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNTg5MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4058918?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64","html_url":"https://github.com/jinxing64","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jinxing64/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFix a bug in collect method for collecting timestamp column, the bug can be reproduced as shown in the following codes and outputs:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlibrary(SparkR)\r\nsparkR.session(master = \"local\")\r\ndf <- data.frame(col1 = c(0, 1, 2), \r\n                 col2 = c(as.POSIXct(\"2017-01-01 00:00:01\"), NA, as.POSIXct(\"2017-01-01 12:00:01\")))\r\n\r\nsdf1 <- createDataFrame(df)\r\nprint(dtypes(sdf1))\r\ndf1 <- collect(sdf1)\r\nprint(lapply(df1, class))\r\n\r\nsdf2 <- filter(sdf1, \"col1 > 0\")\r\nprint(dtypes(sdf2))\r\ndf2 <- collect(sdf2)\r\nprint(lapply(df2, class))\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs we can see from the printed output, the column type of col2 in df2 is converted to numeric unexpectedly, when NA exists at the top of the column. \r\n\r\nThis is caused by method `do.call(c, list)`, if we convert a list, i.e. `do.call(c, list(NA, as.POSIXct(\"2017-01-01 12:00:01\"))`, the class of the result is numeric instead of POSIXct. \r\n\r\nTherefore, we need to cast the data type of the vector explicitly. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe patch can be tested manually with the same code above.\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-24T06:50:24Z","updated_at":"2017-02-13T17:55:22Z","closed_at":"2017-02-12T18:44:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5ff2dce3942405bb64c93e63d979c19c0d481a22","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16689/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16689/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16689/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d6d454ec0a587c456d5e4a964784589643aa4730","head":{"label":"titicaca:sparkr-dev","ref":"sparkr-dev","sha":"d6d454ec0a587c456d5e4a964784589643aa4730","user":{"login":"titicaca","id":1780746,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODA3NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1780746?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/titicaca","html_url":"https://github.com/titicaca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titicaca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titicaca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titicaca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titicaca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titicaca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titicaca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titicaca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titicaca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titicaca/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":79772722,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3OTc3MjcyMg==","name":"spark","full_name":"titicaca/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"titicaca","id":1780746,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODA3NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1780746?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/titicaca","html_url":"https://github.com/titicaca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titicaca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titicaca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titicaca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titicaca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titicaca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titicaca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titicaca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titicaca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/titicaca/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/titicaca/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nToday, you can start a stream that reads from kafka. However, given kafka's configurable retention period, it seems like sometimes you might just want to read all of the data that is available now. As such we should add a version that works with spark.read as well.\r\nThe options should be the same as the streaming kafka source, with the following differences:\r\nstartingOffsets should default to earliest, and should not allow latest (which would always be empty).\r\nendingOffsets should also be allowed and should default to latest. the same assign json format as startingOffsets should also be accepted.\r\nIt would be really good, if things like .limit(n) were enough to prevent all the data from being read (this might just work).\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nKafkaRelationSuite was added for testing batch queries via KafkaUtils.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdds the ability to perform an insert, update, or update command to the JdbcUtils class which supports writing DataFrames to databases via JDBC\r\n\r\nThis functionality has not existed heretofore within Spark and doing an Upsert efficiently is generally difficult. The method presented here strikes a reasonable balance between simplicity and performance and has shown reasonably efficient scaling. The insert operation, while already existing, is implemented slightly differently in this approach to be consistent with how update is implemented. \r\n\r\nThis resolves https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-19335\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis functionality has been tested through extensive manual testing and tuning while developing this patch. If the committers believe that this is a valuable addition, I will be happy to add additional unit tests around this feature.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR refactors CSV schema inference path to be consistent with JSON data source and moves some filtering codes having the similar/same logics into `CSVUtils`.\r\n\r\n It makes the methods in classes have consistent arguments with JSON ones. (this PR renames `.../json/InferSchema.scala` → `.../json/JsonInferSchema.scala`)\r\n\r\n`CSVInferSchema` and `JsonInferSchema` \r\n    \r\n``` scala\r\nprivate[csv] object CSVInferSchema {\r\n  ...\r\n    \r\n  def infer(\r\n      csv: Dataset[String],\r\n      caseSensitive: Boolean,\r\n      options: CSVOptions): StructType = {\r\n  ...\r\n```\r\n    \r\n``` scala\r\nprivate[sql] object JsonInferSchema {\r\n  ...\r\n    \r\n  def infer(\r\n      json: RDD[String],\r\n      columnNameOfCorruptRecord: String,\r\n      configOptions: JSONOptions): StructType = {\r\n  ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese allow schema inference from `Dataset[String]` directly, meaning the similar functionalities that use `JacksonParser`/`JsonInferSchema` for JSON can be easily implemented by

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nHive will expand the view text, so it needs 2 fields: originalText and viewText. Since we don't expand the view text, but only add table properties, perhaps only a single field `viewText` is enough in CatalogTable.\r\n\r\nThis PR brought in the following changes:\r\n1. Remove the param `viewOriginalText` from `CatalogTable`;\r\n2. Update the output of command `DescribeTableCommand`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTested by exsiting test cases, also updated the failed test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR is to revert some changes made in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/15292\r\n\r\n> @darabos  reported Spark 2.1.0 issued the `No suitable driver` exception at the first time when reading a JDBC data source but simply re-executing the same command a second time \"fixes\" the `No suitable driver` error. This only happens when the Hive support is enabled. \r\n\r\nBased on my understanding, the problem is `java.sql.DriverManager` class that can't access drivers loaded by Spark ClassLoader. The changes made in this PR does not sound a solution for the reported issue. It could be caused by the other code changes in 2.1 that change the current ClassLoader \r\n\r\n@darabos Could you please help us try it in your local environment?

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nA logical `Limit` is performed physically by two operations `LocalLimit` and `GlobalLimit`.\r\n\r\nMost of time, we gather all data into a single partition in order to run `GlobalLimit`. If we use a very big limit number, shuffling data causes performance issue also reduces parallelism.\r\n\r\nWe can avoid shuffling into single partition if we don't care data ordering. This patch implements this idea by doing a map stage during global limit. It collects the info of row numbers at each partition. For each partition, we locally retrieves limited data without any shuffling to finish this global limit.\r\n\r\nFor example, we have three partitions with rows (100, 100, 50) respectively. In global limit of 100 rows, we may take (34, 33, 33) rows for each partition locally. After global limit we still have three partitions.\r\n\r\nIf the data partition has certain ordering, we can't distribute required rows evenly to each partitions because it could change data ordering. But we still can avoid shuffling.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nJenkins tests.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-23T08:54:28Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:21:53Z","closed_at":"2018-08-10T09:36:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"69ba0f5750f62f94dc98924d31b29fb3369707ed","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16677/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16677/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16677/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/69513d166ee56587d7b039b5d9645299785dcb77","head":{"label":"viirya:improve-global-limit-parallelism","ref":"improve-global-limit-parallelism","sha":"69513d166ee56587d7b039b5d9645299785dcb77","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis is a supplement to PR #16516 which did not make the value from `getFamily` case insensitive. Current tests of poisson/binomial glm with weight fail when specifying 'Poisson' or 'Binomial', because the calculation of `dispersion` and `pValue` checks the value of family retrieved from `getFamily`\r\n```\r\nmodel.getFamily == Binomial.name || model.getFamily == Poisson.name\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nUpdate existing tests for 'Poisson' and 'Binomial'.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nMove `SQLViewSuite` from `sql/hive` to `sql/core`, so we can test the view supports without hive metastore. Also moved the test cases that specified to hive to `HiveSQLViewSuite`.\r\n\r\nImprove the test coverage of SQLViewSuite, cover the following cases:\r\n1. view resolution(possibly a referenced table/view have changed after the view creation);\r\n2. handle a view with user specified column names;\r\n3. improve the test cases for a nested view.\r\n\r\nAlso added a test case for cyclic view

What changes were proposed in this pull request\r\n\r\nWhen Kmeans using initMode = \"random\" and some random seed, it is possible the actual cluster size doesn't equal to the configured `k`.\r\n\r\nIn this case, summary(model) returns error due to the number of cols of coefficient matrix doesn't equal to k.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n>  col1 <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 0)\r\n>   col2 <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 0)\r\n>   col3 <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 0)\r\n>   cols <- as.data.frame(cbind(col1, col2, col3))\r\n>   df <- createDataFrame(cols)\r\n> \r\n>   model2 <-

methods\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nQueryExecutionListener has two methods onSuccess() and onFailure() that takes a QueryExecution object as a parameter that gets called when a query is executed. It gets called for several of the DataSet methods like take, head, first, collect etc. but doesn't get called for any of the DataFrameWriter methods like saveAsTable, save etc. This commit fixes this issue and makes calls to these two methods from DataFrameWriter output methods.\r\nAlso, added a new property \"spark.sql.queryExecutionListeners\" that can be used to specify instances of QueryExecutionListeners that should be attached to the SparkSession when the spark application starts up.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n Testing was done using unit tests contained in two suites. The unit tests can be executed by :\r\ntest-only *SparkSQLQueryExecutionListenerSuite\r\ntest-only *DataFrameCallbackSuite\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-20T20:34:53Z","updated_at":"2017-02-17T05:11:41Z","closed_at":"2017-02-17T05:11:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1d7e4ac4d9a97dcd17b0a5f4bc80312f88d33a4a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16664/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16664/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16664/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a0c7c22e4097adbdf12e52db37c26a2246d4eddd","head":{"label":"salilsurendran:SPARK-18120","ref":"SPARK-18120","sha":"a0c7c22e4097adbdf12e52db37c26a2246d4eddd","user":{"login":"salilsurendran","id":3181295,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODEyOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3181295?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/salilsurendran","html_url":"https://github.com/salilsurendran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/salilsurendran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/salilsurendran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/salilsurendran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/salilsurendran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/salilsurendran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/salilsurendran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/salilsurendran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/salilsurendran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/salilsurendran/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":79495098,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3OTQ5NTA5OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"salilsurendran/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"salilsurendran","id":3181295,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODEyOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3181295?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/salilsurendran","html_url":"https://github.com/salilsurendran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/salilsurendran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/salilsurendran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/salilsurendran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/salilsurendran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/salilsurendran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/salilsurendran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/salilsurendran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/salilsurendran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/salilsurendran/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/salilsurendran/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe following test will fail on current master\r\n\r\n````scala\r\ntest(\"gmm fails on high dimensional data\") {\r\n    val ctx = spark.sqlContext\r\n    import ctx.implicits._\r\n    val df = Seq(\r\n      Vectors.sparse(GaussianMixture.MAX_NUM_FEATURES + 1, Array(0, 4), Array(3.0, 8.0)),\r\n

intercept[IllegalArgumentException] {\r\n      gm.fit(df)\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n````\r\n\r\nInstead, you'll get an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` or something similar for MLlib. That's because the covariance matrix allocates an array of `numFeatures * numFeatures`, and in this case we get integer overflow. While there is currently a warning that the algorithm does not perform well for high number of features, we should perform an appropriate check to communicate this limitation to users.\r\n\r\nThis patch adds a `require(numFeatures < GaussianMixture.MAX_NUM_FEATURES)` check to ML and MLlib algorithms. For the feature limitation, we can limit it such that we do not get numerical overflow to something like `math.sqrt(Integer.MaxValue).toInt` (about 46k) which eliminates the cryptic error. However in, for example WLS, we need to collect an array on the order of `numFeatures * numFeatures` to the driver and we therefore limit to 4096 features. We may want to keep that convention here for consistency.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests in ML and MLlib.\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-20T19:23:59Z","updated_at":"2017-01-25T15:14:55Z","closed_at":"2017-01-25T15:14:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b2e8c1ae4024c5dd8f444f913dabece851a70c47","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16661/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/16661/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/16661/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5672d1345f661665f521fd1dd4410313ef3ab554","head":{"label":"sethah:gmm_high_dim","ref":"gmm_high_dim","sha":"5672d1345f661665f521fd1dd4410313ef3ab554","user":{"login":"sethah","id":7275795,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNzU3OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7275795?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah","html_url":"https://github.com/sethah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":38016887,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODAxNjg4Nw==","name":"spark","full_name":"sethah/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sethah","id":7275795,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNzU3OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7275795?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah","html_url":"https://github.com/sethah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sethah/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAs I pointed out in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/15807#issuecomment-259143655 , the current subexpression elimination framework has a problem, it always evaluates all common subexpressions at the beginning, even they are inside conditional expressions and may not be accessed.\r\n\r\nIdeally we should implement it like scala lazy

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFor data source tables, we will always reorder the specified table schema, or the query in CTAS, to put partition columns at the end. e.g. `CREATE TABLE t(a int, b int, c int, d int) USING parquet PARTITIONED BY (d, b)` will create a table with schema `<a, c, d, b>`\r\n\r\nHive serde tables don't have this problem before, because its CREATE TABLE syntax specifies data schema and partition schema individually.\r\n\r\nHowever, after we unifed the CREATE TABLE syntax, Hive serde table also need to do the reorder. This PR puts the reorder logic in a analyzer rule,  which works with both data source tables and Hive serde tables.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nnew regression

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn SPARK-8425, we introduced a mechanism for blacklisting executors and nodes (hosts). After a certain number of failures, these resources would be \"blacklisted\" and no further work would be assigned to them for some period of time.\r\n\r\nIn some scenarios, it is better to fail fast, and to simply kill these unreliable resources. This changes proposes to do so by having the BlacklistTracker kill unreliable resources when they would otherwise be \"blacklisted\".\r\n\r\nIn order to be thread safe, this code depends on the CoarseGrainedSchedulerBackend sending a message to the driver backend in order to do the actual killing. This also helps to prevent a race which would permit work to begin on a resource (executor or node), between the time the resource is marked for killing and the time at which it is finally killed.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n./dev/run-tests\r\nRan https://github.com/jsoltren/jose-utils/blob/master/blacklist/test-blacklist.sh, and checked logs to see executors and nodes being killed.\r\n\r\nTesting can likely be improved here; suggestions

Code Generation: Constant Pool Limit\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSupports code generation for large structures that would previously trigger a Constant Pool limit exception, as noted in [SPARK-18016](SPARK-18016). In this fix, when the volume of generated code for the class would exceed 1600k bytes, a new private nested class is declared, and any new functions that would have been inlined to the outer class with an `addNewFunction` call are inlined to the new nested class instead. `addNewFunction` also would now return the name of the function registered (class-qualified, if it would be inlined to a nested class), so that the caller of the function can call it even if inlined to a different class. Additional nested classes are generated if the threshold is met subsequent times. These nested classes are instantiated and declared at the bottom of the generated outer class. \r\n\r\nBecause private nested classes have access to the outer class's global state, but their functions and local state do not count towards the outer class's Constant Pool, and that they can be instantiated in the same outer class without the need to declare additional classes and handle the dependency injection, they seem to be a good candidate to solve this particular issue.\r\n\r\nOne key quality of this patch is that the common path for code generation remains unaffected. The 1600k threshold necessary to split of a nested class should only be exceeded in scenarios where the schema is extremely large. Generated code for most use cases will still be inlined entirely to the single outer class.\r\n\r\nOne other feature of this patch is the compaction of primitive declarations and simply-assigned object declarations (objects initialized to null, or not initialized at all) into arrays. Code generation can sometimes produce an excess of global state, so we reduce the number of declarations that would count towards the Constant Limit by creating arrays such that for a given variable of common type and declaration, it can be mapped to a specific index of an array. Using arrays of mutable state, the number of variables in global state is less constrained by the constant pool limit, but by the maximum size of an array.\r\n\r\nThis patch splits code (only code registered through the `addNewFunction` call) among the outer class and nested classes, and creates arrays for compactable mutable state like below:\r\n\r\n```\r\n     /* 6 */ class SpecificUnsafeProjection extends org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.UnsafeProjection {\r\n     /* 7 */    // Global \"mutable\" state\r\n     /* 8 */    private Object[] references;\r\n     /* 9 */    private UnsafeRow result;\r\n    /* 10 */    private org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.codegen.BufferHolder holder;\r\n    /* 11 */    private org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.codegen.UnsafeRowWriter rowWriter;\r\n    /* 12 */    UTF8String[] mutableStateArray1 = new UTF8String[24003]; // compacted states\r\n    /* 13 */    java.lang.STring[] mutableStateArray = new java.lang.String[8001];\r\n    /* 14 */    int[] mutableStateArray3 = new int[8000];\r\n    /* 15 */    boolean[] mutableStateArray2 = new boolean[32004];\r\n    /* 16 */\r\n    /* 17 */    public SpecificUnsafeProjection(Object[] references) {\r\n    /* 18 */        this.references = references;\r\n    /* 19 */        result = new UnsafeRow(8001);\r\n    /* 20 */        holder = new org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.codegen.BuffereHolder(result, 256032);\r\n    /* 21 */        rowWriter = new org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.codegen.UnsafeRowWriter(holder, 8001);\r\n    /* 22 */        // array initializations for compacted states\r\n    /* 23 */        for (int i = 0; i < mutableStateArray1.length; i++) {\r\n    /* 24 */            mutableStateArray1[i] = null;\r\n    /* 25 */        }\r\n    /* 26 */\r\n    /* 27 */        for (int i = 0; i < mutableStateArray2.length; i++) {\r\n    /* 28 */            mutableStateArray2[i] = false;\r\n    /* 29 */        }\r\n    /* 30 */     }\r\n    /* 31 */     // method inlined to outer class\r\n    /* 32 */     private void evalIfCondExpr50(InternalRow i) {\r\n    /* 33 */         boolean isNull703 = i.isNullAt(0);\r\n    /* 34 */         org.apache.spark.sql.Row value703 = isNull703 ? null : \r\n    /* 35 */             ((org.apache.spark.sql.Row)i.get(0, null));\r\n    /* 36 */\r\n    /* 37 */         if (isNull703) {\r\n    /* 38 */             throw new NullPointerException(((java.lang.String) references[200]));\r\n    /* 39 */         }\r\n    /* 40 */         boolean isNull701 = true;\r\n    /* 41 */         boolean value701 = false;\r\n    /* 42 */         if (!false) {\r\n    /* 43 */\r\n    /* 44 */             mutableStateArray3[49] = 50;\r\n    /* 45 */\r\n    /* 46 */             isNull701 = false;\r\n    /* 47 */             if (!isNull701) {\r\n    /* 48 */                 value701 = value703.isNullAt(mutableStateArray3[49]);\r\n    /* 49 */             }\r\n    /* 50 */         }  // examples of mutableStateArray aliases for primitive global state\r\n    /* 51 */         mutableStateArray2[200] = isNull701;\r\n    /* 52 */         mutableStateArray2[201] = value701;\r\n    /* 53 */     }\r\n     ...              \r\n /* 70344 */     public UnsafeRow apply(InternalRow i) {\r\n /* 70345 */         nestedClassInstance5.apply589_0(i); // referencing a nested class method\r\n     ...\r\n /* 70398 */         return result;\r\n /* 70399 */     }\r\n /* 70400 */     // Instantiation of nested classes\r\n /* 70401 */     private NestedClass5 nestedClassInstance5 = new NestedClass();\r\n /* 70402 */     private NestedClass4 nestedClassInstance4 = new NestedClass();\r\n     ...\r\n /* 70406 */     private NestedClass nestedClassInstance = new NestedClass();\r\n /* 70407 */     // Declaration of a nested class\r\n /* 70408 */     private NestedClass5 {\r\n /* 70409 */         // Code inlined to a nested class\r\n /* 70410 */         private void apply519_0(InternalRow fieldName1105) {\r\n     ...\r\n/* 340829 */     } // end of last nested class\r\n/* 348030 */ } // end of the outer class\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded a new test to the DataframeComplexTypeSuite that tests converting a large structure to a dataset.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen we query a table with a filter on partitioned columns, we will push the partition filter to the metastore to get matched partitions directly.\r\n\r\nIn `HiveExternalCatalog.listPartitionsByFilter`, we assume the column names in partition filter are already normalized and we don't need to consider case sensitivity. However, `HiveTableScanExec` doesn't follow this assumption. This PR fixes it.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nnew regression

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nTo implement DDL commands, we added several analyzer rules in sql/hive module to analyze DDL related plans. However, our `Analyzer` currently only have one extending interface: `extendedResolutionRules`, which defines extra rules that will be run together with other rules in the resolution batch, and doesn't fit DDL rules well, because:\r\n\r\n1. DDL rules may do some checking and normalization, but we may do it many times as the resolution batch will run rules again and again, until fixed point, and it's hard to tell if a DDL rule has already done its checking and normalization. It's fine because DDL rules are idempotent, but it's bad for analysis performance\r\n2. some DDL rules may depend on others, and it's pretty hard to write `if` conditions to guarantee the dependencies. It will be good if we have a batch which run rules in one pass, so that we can guarantee the dependencies by rules order.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new extending interface in `Analyzer`: `postHocResolutionRules`, which defines rules that will be run only once in a batch runs right after the resolution batch.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nexisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFault-tolerance in spark requires special handling of shuffle fetch\r\nfailures.  The Executor would catch FetchFailedException and send a\r\nspecial msg back to the driver.\r\n\r\nHowever, intervening user code could intercept that exception, and wrap\r\nit with something else.  This even happens in SparkSQL.  So rather than\r\nchecking the thrown exception only, we'll store the fetch failure directly\r\nin the TaskContext, where users can't touch it.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded a test case which failed before the fix.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSo far, we allow users to create a table with an empty schema: `CREATE TABLE tab1`. This could break many code paths if we enable it. Thus, we should follow Hive to block it. \r\n\r\nFor Hive serde tables, some serde libraries require the specified schema and record it in the metastore. To get the list, we need to check `hive.serdes.using.metastore.for.schema,` which contains a list of serdes that require user-specified schema. The default values are\r\n\r\n- org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.orc.OrcSerde\r\n- org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.lazy.LazySimpleSerDe\r\n- org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.columnar.ColumnarSerDe\r\n-

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nA logical `Limit` is performed actually by two physical operations `LocalLimit` and `GlobalLimit`.\r\n\r\nIn most of time, before `GlobalLimit`, we will perform a shuffle exchange to shuffle data to single partition. When the limit number is not trivially small, this shuffling is costing.\r\n\r\nThis change tries to perform `GlobalLimit` without shuffling data to single partition. The approach is similar to `SparkPlan.executeTake`.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nChange non-cbo estimation behavior of aggregate:\r\n- If groupExpression is empty, we can know row count (=1) and the corresponding size;\r\n- otherwise, estimation falls back to UnaryNode's computeStats method, which should not propagate rowCount and attributeStats in Statistics because they are not estimated in that method.\r\n\r\n## How
