Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-10-17T09:24:24Z","updated_at":"2023-10-18T03:52:29Z","closed_at":"2023-10-18T03:52:28Z","merged_at":"2023-10-18T03:52:28Z","merge_commit_sha":"c5efc65a99cab6d558bcff704fd76ba0f008e353","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13220/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13220/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13220/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/cbdcd3f8d7afd41e1b0ec19caef4925b0f7c8025","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:1017-lock","ref":"1017-lock","sha":"cbdcd3f8d7afd41e1b0ec19caef4925b0f7c8025","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

What is the purpose of the change\r\nSimilarly, to #13153, I noticed that in both `testNonEcho` and `testEcho` test cases, there's repetitive creation of mock for `invocation` and `invoker`. To make the test code cleaner, more readable, and easier to maintain, I've taken this refactoring.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\nI introduced two methods: `createMockRpcInvocation` and `createMockInvoker`. In the two tests, I removed the redundant mock creation sections and instead call these methods to create the mocks.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-10-16T18:39:40Z","updated_at":"2023-10-17T08:55:42Z","closed_at":"2023-10-17T08:55:42Z","merged_at":"2023-10-17T08:55:42Z","merge_commit_sha":"78bb3dc0496fa149d0317f667c859a6f7e1448fd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13215/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13215/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13215/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/335a34c7e56dd4985ae62d2f1792bfe43c7a41c3","head":{"label":"gzhao9:refactor-EchoFilterTest","ref":"refactor-EchoFilterTest","sha":"335a34c7e56dd4985ae62d2f1792bfe43c7a41c3","user":{"login":"gzhao9","id":74684732,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0Njg0NzMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/74684732?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9","html_url":"https://github.com/gzhao9","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":700518906,"node_id":"R_kgDOKcER-g","name":"dubbo","full_name":"gzhao9/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gzhao9","id":74684732,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0Njg0NzMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/74684732?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9","html_url":"https://github.com/gzhao9","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gzhao9/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nSimilarly, to #13153, I noticed that in `RpcUtilsTest`, there is also a duplicate creation of the mock.\r\n\r\nThe `Invoker` was duplicated to create the mock object 10 times, in 10 test cases.\r\nI used a similar approach refactoring to increase code readability.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nI refactored the code to introduce two methods: `CreateMockInvoker(URL url)` and `CreateMockInvoker()`. I've used these methods in 10 test cases to reduce the repetitive creation of the `Invoker` mock.\r\n\r\n### Additional questions.\r\nI also noticed that this pattern appears in different test files for different packages, do you prefer to use shared utility classes or define these methods in each file?\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-10-16T17:41:56Z","updated_at":"2023-10-18T02:06:36Z","closed_at":"2023-10-18T02:06:35Z","merged_at":"2023-10-18T02:06:35Z","merge_commit_sha":"3f07e683a184670ebfc0ef48c268836931b39a75","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13214/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13214/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13214/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/adb38298ebeb027d1067f58d0a631bca8e0e2756","head":{"label":"gzhao9:refactor-RpcUtilsTest","ref":"refactor-RpcUtilsTest","sha":"adb38298ebeb027d1067f58d0a631bca8e0e2756","user":{"login":"gzhao9","id":74684732,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0Njg0NzMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/74684732?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9","html_url":"https://github.com/gzhao9","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":700518906,"node_id":"R_kgDOKcER-g","name":"dubbo","full_name":"gzhao9/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gzhao9","id":74684732,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0Njg0NzMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/74684732?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9","html_url":"https://github.com/gzhao9","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gzhao9/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-10-12T09:57:14Z","updated_at":"2024-05-15T04:25:56Z","closed_at":"2024-05-15T04:25:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ba23b29d6815cf331ad805cc47d3544ddd1030fa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13196/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13196/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13196/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/0f11ac1f7e23d4b25da56e8d59db3d00e9eaaece","head":{"label":"finefuture:3.2-Safe-SerializingExecutor","ref":"3.2-Safe-SerializingExecutor","sha":"0f11ac1f7e23d4b25da56e8d59db3d00e9eaaece","user":{"login":"finefuture","id":18413695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDEzNjk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18413695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture","html_url":"https://github.com/finefuture","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":627787338,"node_id":"R_kgDOJWtGSg","name":"dubbo","full_name":"finefuture/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"finefuture","id":18413695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDEzNjk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18413695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture","html_url":"https://github.com/finefuture","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finefuture/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/finefuture/dubbo","description":"Apache

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

This occurs in five test cases in `ManyToManyMethodHandlerTest.java`, `ManyToOneMethodHandlerTest.java` and `OneToManyMethodHandlerTest.java`, as highlighted in issue #13154.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nWe created a reusable class `creatObserverAdapter` to create the mock, avoiding duplicate creation of the mock in 5 test cases.\r\nSince in `ManyToOneMethodHandlerTest.java` and `OneToManyMethodHandlerTest.java`, the mock is both created duplicated in two test cases, we set this mock object as a class attribute and create it in `@BeforeEach`.\r\nAfter refactoring, we removed duplicate lines of code for the following five test cases and improved readability and maintainability: \r\n - ManyToManyMethodHandlerTest.java\r\n    - [testInvoke()](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/blob/3.2/dubbo-plugin/dubbo-reactive/src/test/java/org/apache/dubbo/reactive/ManyToManyMethodHandlerTest.java#L43-L52) Lines 43-52 \r\n  - ManyToOneMethodHandlerTest.java\r\n    - [testInvoke()](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/blob/3.2/dubbo-plugin/dubbo-reactive/src/test/java/org/apache/dubbo/reactive/ManyToOneMethodHandlerTest.java#L43-L52) Lines 43-52 \r\n    - [testError()](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/blob/3.2/dubbo-plugin/dubbo-reactive/src/test/java/org/apache/dubbo/reactive/ManyToOneMethodHandlerTest.java#L67-L77) Lines 68-77\r\n  - OneToManyMethodHandlerTest.java\r\n    - [testInvoke()](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/blob/3.2/dubbo-plugin/dubbo-reactive/src/test/java/org/apache/dubbo/reactive/OneToManyMethodHandlerTest.java#L43-L52) Lines 43-52 \r\n    - [testError()](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/blob/3.2/dubbo-plugin/dubbo-reactive/src/test/java/org/apache/dubbo/reactive/OneToManyMethodHandlerTest.java#L63-L74) Lines 65-74\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-10-09T15:53:00Z","updated_at":"2023-10-10T07:58:25Z","closed_at":"2023-10-10T07:52:47Z","merged_at":"2023-10-10T07:52:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"5d979c18f2cfaa1e0d8fb64a2cb06f4797a8e18c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13175/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13175/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13175/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/ee89392e0063755c0e17f6cbf963598adaf092a3","head":{"label":"gzhao9:Refactor-org.apache.dubbo.reactive","ref":"Refactor-org.apache.dubbo.reactive","sha":"ee89392e0063755c0e17f6cbf963598adaf092a3","user":{"login":"gzhao9","id":74684732,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0Njg0NzMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/74684732?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9","html_url":"https://github.com/gzhao9","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":700518906,"node_id":"R_kgDOKcER-g","name":"dubbo","full_name":"gzhao9/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gzhao9","id":74684732,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0Njg0NzMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/74684732?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9","html_url":"https://github.com/gzhao9","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gzhao9/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

Purpose of the Change\r\n\r\nThis PR is aimed at resolving the issue of duplicated creation of mock. This occurs in five test cases in `StubInvocationUtilTest.java`, as highlighted in issue #13153.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nWe created 5 reusable methods to create the mock, avoiding duplicate creation of the mock in 5 test cases.\r\nWe also set the five mock objects as class attributes and create them in `@BeforeEach`.\r\nAfter removing duplicate mocks for 5 test cases, our refactoring reduced the number of lines of code by 76 lines, improving readability and maintainability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-10-09T15:12:06Z","updated_at":"2023-10-10T03:08:58Z","closed_at":"2023-10-10T02:12:19Z","merged_at":"2023-10-10T02:12:19Z","merge_commit_sha":"49dd3d0236b66f6154c3698375d97391429a0225","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13174/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13174/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13174/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/969150046f64f117c40e33f259ce76dd21ec8931","head":{"label":"gzhao9:refactor-StubInvocationUtilTest","ref":"refactor-StubInvocationUtilTest","sha":"969150046f64f117c40e33f259ce76dd21ec8931","user":{"login":"gzhao9","id":74684732,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0Njg0NzMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/74684732?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9","html_url":"https://github.com/gzhao9","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":700518906,"node_id":"R_kgDOKcER-g","name":"dubbo","full_name":"gzhao9/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gzhao9","id":74684732,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0Njg0NzMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/74684732?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9","html_url":"https://github.com/gzhao9","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gzhao9/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gzhao9/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-10-08T03:02:28Z","updated_at":"2023-10-08T04:16:13Z","closed_at":"2023-10-08T04:16:10Z","merged_at":"2023-10-08T04:16:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"0dab17f11da8053b64f84ed98ae831c00aee346d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13157/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13157/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13157/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/4bac2a377275bbc76e025ad8335dbdee65daaac0","head":{"label":"CrazyHZM:fix/virtual_license","ref":"fix/virtual_license","sha":"4bac2a377275bbc76e025ad8335dbdee65daaac0","user":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":152715619,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTI3MTU2MTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"CrazyHZM/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM/dubbo","description":"Apache

change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-10-08T01:45:49Z","updated_at":"2023-11-06T11:43:31Z","closed_at":"2023-10-19T04:31:59Z","merged_at":"2023-10-19T04:31:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"416374cd78f87fc20d293e4f2af6e6ef452b198d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"icodening","id":42876375,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODc2Mzc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42876375?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening","html_url":"https://github.com/icodening","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icodening/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13155/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13155/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13155/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/bdf744848c77cce213dd337eff32fb8eb5014f5b","head":{"label":"SpringStudent:3.2","ref":"3.2","sha":"bdf744848c77cce213dd337eff32fb8eb5014f5b","user":{"login":"SpringStudent","id":14833956,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODMzOTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14833956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpringStudent","html_url":"https://github.com/SpringStudent","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpringStudent/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpringStudent/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpringStudent/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpringStudent/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpringStudent/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpringStudent/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpringStudent/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpringStudent/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpringStudent/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:3.2","ref":"3.2","sha":"fa11b68a16a550ed19bb263d2f3ecd6d20a5fb8d","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apach

[GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-10-07T07:55:11Z","updated_at":"2023-10-08T02:07:35Z","closed_at":"2023-10-08T02:07:35Z","merged_at":"2023-10-08T02:07:35Z","merge_commit_sha":"b2e081e5139b43eac48200ed44b3e3cc1236455a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13150/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13150/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13150/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/987bfd119a6a5a2cc918294c26f30605002fdb77","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:1007-zk","ref":"1007-zk","sha":"987bfd119a6a5a2cc918294c26f30605002fdb77","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to

this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-09-30T12:38:53Z","updated_at":"2023-10-19T04:32:39Z","closed_at":"2023-10-19T04:32:38Z","merged_at":"2023-10-19T04:32:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"d0c41f512e3478ad10ed37b5196bee38c60b578d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13145/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13145/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13145/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/3219783b5728b16ced58ae28c6f1ae3c08a0ecb6","head":{"label":"sadfera:feat_remove_jprotoc","ref":"feat_remove_jprotoc","sha":"3219783b5728b16ced58ae28c6f1ae3c08a0ecb6","user":{"login":"sadfera","id":134938705,"node_id":"U_kgDOCAsAUQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/134938705?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadfera","html_url":"https://github.com/sadfera","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadfera/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadfera/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadfera/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadfera/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadfera/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadfera/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadfera/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadfera/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadfera/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":698603519,"node_id":"R_kgDOKaPX_w","name":"dubbo","full_name":"sadfera/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sadfera","id":134938705,"node_id":"U_kgDOCAsAUQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/134938705?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadfera","html_url":"https://github.com/sadfera","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadfera/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadfera/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadfera/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadfera/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadfera/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadfera/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadfera/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadfera/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadfera/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sadfera/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-09-30T02:36:31Z","updated_at":"2023-09-30T03:28:30Z","closed_at":"2023-09-30T02:38:24Z","merged_at":"2023-09-30T02:38:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"8b0bd8a043d5b77a485a22e429b9fcb953d5e099","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13144/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13144/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13144/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/55ffdc212652aed046a9efb5edd10ee793a89333","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0930-metrics","ref":"0930-metrics","sha":"55ffdc212652aed046a9efb5edd10ee793a89333","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-09-27T03:21:19Z","updated_at":"2023-09-29T12:33:22Z","closed_at":"2023-09-29T12:33:22Z","merged_at":"2023-09-29T12:33:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"2bf662ce90c0aaac5d1d6c7eab2b9e420a69e315","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13138/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13138/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13138/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/a9cdd516bd77c02e9aed07668b577337891866ca","head":{"label":"liuzg-coder:3.3","ref":"3.3","sha":"a9cdd516bd77c02e9aed07668b577337891866ca","user":{"login":"liuzg-coder","id":65394407,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1Mzk0NDA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65394407?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder","html_url":"https://github.com/liuzg-coder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":691446148,"node_id":"R_kgDOKTahhA","name":"dubbo","full_name":"liuzg-coder/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"liuzg-coder","id":65394407,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1Mzk0NDA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65394407?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder","html_url":"https://github.com/liuzg-coder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/liuzg-coder/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-09-26T04:18:58Z","updated_at":"2023-09-26T06:01:43Z","closed_at":"2023-09-26T06:01:43Z","merged_at":"2023-09-26T06:01:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"c96a8f3719a6b295133a6bac02409459a0add3a1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13130/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13130/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13130/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/ba56e3dec5a92df19139f90acee6dd3f81dd6445","head":{"label":"CrazyHZM:fix/loom_module","ref":"fix/loom_module","sha":"ba56e3dec5a92df19139f90acee6dd3f81dd6445","user":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":152715619,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTI3MTU2MTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"CrazyHZM/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM/dubbo","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-09-26T03:02:57Z","updated_at":"2023-09-26T03:03:06Z","closed_at":"2023-09-26T03:03:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a5b148b7e4010179afe3c2e5f668fc6c34a2fbd3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13129/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13129/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13129/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/60980bc6dc29ee7d541604490504f3f713996684","head":{"label":"liuzg-coder:3.3","ref":"3.3","sha":"60980bc6dc29ee7d541604490504f3f713996684","user":{"login":"liuzg-coder","id":65394407,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1Mzk0NDA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65394407?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder","html_url":"https://github.com/liuzg-coder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":691446148,"node_id":"R_kgDOKTahhA","name":"dubbo","full_name":"liuzg-coder/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"liuzg-coder","id":65394407,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1Mzk0NDA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65394407?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder","html_url":"https://github.com/liuzg-coder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuzg-coder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/liuzg-coder/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-09-26T02:06:33Z","updated_at":"2023-09-26T03:25:58Z","closed_at":"2023-09-26T03:25:57Z","merged_at":"2023-09-26T03:25:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"66eaadd63c8b83d1a9d66bf79e682ae2a6ba648c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13126/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13126/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13126/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/41540503590614140569b1fc49939f2cba23ab2b","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0926-testcase","ref":"0926-testcase","sha":"41540503590614140569b1fc49939f2cba23ab2b","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-09-25T14:31:01Z","updated_at":"2024-05-17T14:09:45Z","closed_at":"2024-05-17T14:09:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a2c33e4f5bb093819020de46e505640277568362","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":699741981,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTk3NDE5ODE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/labels/status/don%E2%80%99t-merge","name":"status/don’t-merge","color":"D93F0B","default":false,"description":"No

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-09-25T04:13:22Z","updated_at":"2023-09-26T03:03:23Z","closed_at":"2023-09-26T03:03:23Z","merged_at":"2023-09-26T03:03:23Z","merge_commit_sha":"4f32e0aba363a413749fd90a34f3fc31a034be63","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13111/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13111/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13111/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/cd56b9a0d90bfad141fee84f1db851bbf07bbe19","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0925-loom-support","ref":"0925-loom-support","sha":"cd56b9a0d90bfad141fee84f1db851bbf07bbe19","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-09-24T15:07:46Z","updated_at":"2023-10-12T07:35:42Z","closed_at":"2023-10-12T07:35:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"59348b83c8f6bc60711de99deb47538a8585cf66","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13110/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13110/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13110/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/597d4a90bf8a27daedabf8aa414aa2caf2ffd5ea","head":{"label":"mr3:3.2","ref":"3.2","sha":"597d4a90bf8a27daedabf8aa414aa2caf2ffd5ea","user":{"login":"mr3","id":2427381,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjczODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2427381?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mr3","html_url":"https://github.com/mr3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mr3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mr3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mr3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mr3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mr3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mr3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mr3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mr3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mr3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":617801447,"node_id":"R_kgDOJNLm5w","name":"dubbo","full_name":"mr3/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mr3","id":2427381,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjczODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2427381?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mr3","html_url":"https://github.com/mr3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mr3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mr3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mr3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mr3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mr3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mr3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mr3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mr3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mr3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mr3/dubbo","description":"Apache

contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-09-22T13:58:27Z","updated_at":"2023-09-30T02:06:22Z","closed_at":"2023-09-30T02:06:22Z","merged_at":"2023-09-30T02:06:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"70600eb632776a72604a61aaa2d7a008a7f2c1bb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13104/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13104/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13104/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/10a8f93b6b2ee71ba4a46a667db319af456cdc6b","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0922-metrics","ref":"0922-metrics","sha":"10a8f93b6b2ee71ba4a46a667db319af456cdc6b","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-09-22T12:23:20Z","updated_at":"2023-09-25T01:40:19Z","closed_at":"2023-09-25T01:40:19Z","merged_at":"2023-09-25T01:40:19Z","merge_commit_sha":"da5c7ed33dd2ca53946b228f105453ccb0d80b93","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13103/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13103/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13103/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/53b494f07a3d3b7f8db99321d9d708d4d931e2d9","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0922-cache","ref":"0922-cache","sha":"53b494f07a3d3b7f8db99321d9d708d4d931e2d9","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-09-21T03:24:25Z","updated_at":"2023-09-21T06:07:15Z","closed_at":"2023-09-21T06:07:15Z","merged_at":"2023-09-21T06:07:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"705d96e9f6619689e4e1f135e6ecd9891c3f0159","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13090/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13090/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13090/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/6053a1a62ebe24e9cae5c1919393ff6e2a32be0b","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0921-uts","ref":"0921-uts","sha":"6053a1a62ebe24e9cae5c1919393ff6e2a32be0b","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

[GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-09-20T12:30:01Z","updated_at":"2023-09-21T01:36:00Z","closed_at":"2023-09-21T01:35:59Z","merged_at":"2023-09-21T01:35:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"9eb49e24c35dda02c180d1b78b480f411708d7c8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13087/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13087/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13087/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/184ba84f6eaa86f098c5c7290fbda7d7b5522b97","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0920-fix-ut","ref":"0920-fix-ut","sha":"184ba84f6eaa86f098c5c7290fbda7d7b5522b97","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2023-09-20T07:14:00Z","updated_at":"2023-09-20T12:29:24Z","closed_at":"2023-09-20T12:29:24Z","merged_at":"2023-09-20T12:29:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"7a660fafd1ea5537d7bf3edb1f89b2de06716403","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13083/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/13083/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/13083/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/deb53d73be46cb28ddfd2917df293ee90a246bda","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:jdk21","ref":"jdk21","sha":"deb53d73be46cb28ddfd2917df293ee90a246bda","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache
