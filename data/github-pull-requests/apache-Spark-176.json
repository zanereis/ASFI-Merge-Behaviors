What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR proposes to introduce a new JDBC option `refreshKrb5Config` which allows to reflect the change of `krb5.conf`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIn the current master, JDBC datasources can't accept `refreshKrb5Config` which is defined in `Krb5LoginModule`.\r\nSo even if we change the `krb5.conf` after establishing a connection, the change will not be reflected.\r\n\r\nThe similar issue happens when we run multiple `*KrbIntegrationSuites` at the same time.\r\n`MiniKDC` starts and stops every KerberosIntegrationSuite and different port number is recorded to `krb5.conf`.\r\nDue to `SecureConnectionProvider.JDBCConfiguration` doesn't take `refreshKrb5Config`, KerberosIntegrationSuites except the first running one see the wrong port so those suites fail.\r\nYou can easily confirm with the following command.\r\n```\r\nbuild/sbt -Phive Phive-thriftserver -Pdocker-integration-tests \"testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.jdbc.*KrbIntegrationSuite\"\r\n```\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. Users can set `refreshKrb5Config` to refresh krb5 relevant configuration.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

are three LocationStrategy: PreferBrokers, PreferConsistent, PreferFixed. I got a scenario that I need a random one. There are plenty of topic partitions that are varies from each other with different records inside. And I have a lot of executors. PreferBrokers does not help here. PreferConsistent will make things worse that some executor will always get heavy tasks. PreferFixed does not help too, because it is fixed, neither to say I have to create a mapping manually.\r\n\r\nthis is another PR for SPARK-35212 compare to #32326\r\n\r\nA random LocationStrategy should dispatch a topic partition to different executors in different window. This would balance the load among spark executors.\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nI added a PreferRandom case object, which will pass null to KafkaRDD constructor. And in KafkaRDD.getPreferredLocations method, if the parameter is null, it will randomly pick an executor for a partition.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nUser will have another option that may be helpful.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nI constructed PreferFixed with a faked RandomLocationStrategyMap inside which always return a random executor hostname, and verified with 1000+ topic partitions across against 2000+ executors. It worked.","created_at":"2021-04-26T02:42:55Z","updated_at":"2021-08-08T00:08:47Z","closed_at":"2021-08-08T00:08:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a1d0cf158e44d598ca1f465e29d5607f55e82901","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32341/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32341/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/32341/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5b3185f3cbe954facaa3ee939284383704b32fb9","head":{"label":"tiehexue:SPARK-35212","ref":"SPARK-35212","sha":"5b3185f3cbe954facaa3ee939284383704b32fb9","user":{"login":"tiehexue","id":953353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MzM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/953353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiehexue","html_url":"https://github.com/tiehexue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiehexue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiehexue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiehexue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiehexue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiehexue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiehexue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiehexue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiehexue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiehexue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":361209480,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNjEyMDk0ODA=","name":"spark","full_name":"tiehexue/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tiehexue","id":953353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MzM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/953353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiehexue","html_url":"https://github.com/tiehexue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiehexue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiehexue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiehexue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiehexue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiehexue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiehexue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiehexue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiehexue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiehexue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tiehexue/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nModifies the UpdateFields optimizer to fix correctness issues with certain nested and chained withField operations. Examples for recreating the issue are in the new unit tests as well as the JIRA issue.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCertain withField patterns can cause Exceptions or even incorrect results. It appears to be a result of the additional UpdateFields optimization added in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29812. It traverses fieldOps in reverse order to take the last one per field, but this can cause nested structs to change order which leads to mismatches between the schema and the actual data. This updates the optimization to maintain the initial ordering of nested structs to match the generated schema. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nIt fixes exceptions and incorrect results for valid uses in the latest Spark release.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn YARN mode, for better user experience, when Spark is started, not only the AppID is printed, but the Tracking URL is also printed to allow users to better track Spark Job\r\n\r\n![clipboard_image_1619343476789](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40849158/115990609-c1fc3000-a5f6-11eb-8ce5-2e3a66348c09.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn practice, the user needs to track the Spark task through the YARN Trackting URL. At the moment, it is just printing the appId, which is a bit of a nuisance for the user to use. You need to look up YARN and find the corresponding app. If the trackting URL information is available, the user can open the URL connection directly，This improves the user experience\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThis just prints the tracking URL, so they won't cause behaviour change.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch changes custom metric updating to update per certain rows (currently 100), instead of per row.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nBased on previous discussion https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/31451#discussion_r605413557, we should only update custom metrics per certain (e.g. 100) rows and also at the end of the task. Updating per row doesn't make too much benefit.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nExisting unit test.\r\n","created_at":"2021-04-25T06:47:57Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:25:08Z","closed_at":"2021-05-06T13:21:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9b00569477f15090819ac19f63c5b34af2563ef5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdd `ShuffledHashJoin` pattern check in `OptimizeSkewedJoin` so that we can optimize it.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently, we have already supported all type of join through hint that make it easy to choose the join implementation.\r\n\r\nWe would choose `ShuffledHashJoin` if one table is not big but over the broadcast threshold. It's better that we can support optimize it in `OptimizeSkewedJoin`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nProbably yes, the execute plan in AQE mode may be changed.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

are three LocationStrategy: PreferBrokers, PreferConsistent, PreferFixed. I got a scenario that I need a random one. There are plenty of topic partitions that are varies from each other with different records inside. And I have a lot of executors. PreferBrokers does not help here. PreferConsistent will make things worse that some executor will always get heavy tasks. PreferFixed does not help too, because it is fixed, neither to say I have to create a mapping manually.\r\n\r\nA random LocationStrategy should dispatch a topic partition to different executors in different window. This would balance the load among spark executors.\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nI added a new method getExecutorHosts in SparkContext which provides host name list. And a PreferRandom case object, which has a random method that returns a \"faked\" map. That map's get method randomly return a host name.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nUser will have another option that may be helpful.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nI constructed PreferFixed with RandomLocationStrategyMap inside, and verified with 1000+ topic partitions across against 2000+ executors. It

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR backports SPARK-35210 (#32318).\r\nThis PR proposes to upgrade Jetty to 9.4.40.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nSPARK-34988 (#32091) upgraded Jetty to 9.4.39 for CVE-2021-28165.\r\nBut after the upgrade, Jetty 9.4.40 was released to fix the ERR_CONNECTION_RESET issue (https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/issues/6152).\r\nThis issue seems to affect Jetty 9.4.39 when POST method is used with SSL.\r\nFor Spark, job submission using REST and ThriftServer with HTTPS protocol can be affected.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo. No released version uses Jetty 9.3.39.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nCI.","created_at":"2021-04-24T10:39:24Z","updated_at":"2021-04-24T16:40:13Z","closed_at":"2021-04-24T16:40:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d9b9e9b3e9a41f253ece5dba40d55bb56fc6dcf2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32324/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32324/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/32324/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d90b13e9323498b5ca3262da8bbe968e929f901e","head":{"label":"sarutak:backport-3.1-SPARK-35210","ref":"backport-3.1-SPARK-35210","sha":"d90b13e9323498b5ca3262da8bbe968e929f901e","user":{"login":"sarutak","id":4736016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak","html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19300892,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTMwMDg5Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"sarutak/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sarutak","id":4736016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak","html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR backports SPARK-35210 (#32318).\r\nThis PR proposes to upgrade Jetty to 9.4.40.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nSPARK-34988 (#32091) upgraded Jetty to 9.4.39 for CVE-2021-28165.\r\nBut after the upgrade, Jetty 9.4.40 was released to fix the ERR_CONNECTION_RESET issue (https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/issues/6152).\r\nThis issue seems to affect Jetty 9.4.39 when POST method is used with SSL.\r\nFor Spark, job submission using REST and ThriftServer with HTTPS protocol can be affected.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo. No released version uses Jetty 9.3.39.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nCI.","created_at":"2021-04-24T10:37:26Z","updated_at":"2021-04-24T22:11:18Z","closed_at":"2021-04-24T22:11:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"071cb9b2c42c12299ee4d8824e102ddd4235d771","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32323/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32323/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/32323/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/27570bc1b8da9881e63db125a818263e7c984a65","head":{"label":"sarutak:backport-3.0-SPARK-35210","ref":"backport-3.0-SPARK-35210","sha":"27570bc1b8da9881e63db125a818263e7c984a65","user":{"login":"sarutak","id":4736016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak","html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19300892,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTMwMDg5Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"sarutak/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sarutak","id":4736016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak","html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR backports SPARK-35210 (#32318).\r\nThis PR proposes to upgrade Jetty to 9.4.40.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nSPARK-34988 (#32091) upgraded Jetty to 9.4.39 for CVE-2021-28165.\r\nBut after the upgrade, Jetty 9.4.40 was released to fix the ERR_CONNECTION_RESET issue (https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/issues/6152).\r\nThis issue seems to affect Jetty 9.4.39 when POST method is used with SSL.\r\nFor Spark, job submission using REST and ThriftServer with HTTPS protocol can be affected.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo. No released version uses Jetty 9.3.39.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nCI.","created_at":"2021-04-24T10:30:48Z","updated_at":"2021-04-25T05:47:22Z","closed_at":"2021-04-25T05:47:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"11e910ec20de7bb88a8b57eff7bf9a97abc507fb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32322/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32322/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/32322/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/44957018e03c50aa9659ecef18f3694e4889858c","head":{"label":"sarutak:backport-SPARK-35210","ref":"backport-SPARK-35210","sha":"44957018e03c50aa9659ecef18f3694e4889858c","user":{"login":"sarutak","id":4736016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak","html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19300892,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTMwMDg5Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"sarutak/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sarutak","id":4736016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak","html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR proposes to upgrade Jetty to 9.4.40.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nSPARK-34988 (#32091) upgraded Jetty to 9.4.39 for CVE-2021-28165.\r\nBut after the upgrade, Jetty 9.4.40 was released to fix the ERR_CONNECTION_RESET issue (https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/issues/6152).\r\nThis issue seems to affect Jetty 9.4.39 when POST method is used with SSL.\r\nFor Spark, job submission using REST and ThriftServer with HTTPS protocol can be affected.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo. No released version uses Jetty 9.3.39.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is another attempt to fix the flaky test \"query without test harness\" on ContinuousSuite.\r\n\r\n`query without test harness` is flaky because it starts a continuous query with two partitions but assumes they will run at the same speed.\r\n\r\nIn this test, 0 and 2 will be written to partition 0, 1 and 3 will be written to partition 1. It assumes when we see 3, 2 should be written to the memory sink. But this is not guaranteed. We can add `if (currentValue == 2) Thread.sleep(5000)` at this line https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/b2a2b5d8206b7c09b180b8b6363f73c6c3fdb1d8/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/streaming/continuous/ContinuousRateStreamSource.scala#L135 to reproduce the failure: `Result set Set([0], [1], [3]) are not a superset of Set(0, 1, 2, 3)!`\r\n\r\nThe fix is changing `waitForRateSourceCommittedValue` to wait until all partitions reach the desired values before stopping the query.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFix a flaky test.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests. Manually verify the reproduction I mentioned above doesn't fail after this change.","created_at":"2021-04-23T23:55:19Z","updated_at":"2021-04-26T23:40:29Z","closed_at":"2021-04-26T23:07:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"81372a761cca66f3604b4199bf44206bdbb28f2e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdd a common functions `getWorkspaceFilePath` (which prefixed with spark home) to `SparkFunctionSuite`, and applies these the function to where they're extracted from.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nSpark sql has test suites to read resources when running tests. The way of getting the path of resources is commonly used in different suites. We can extract them into a function to ease the code maintenance.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

However, the current `CatalystTypeConverters` requires you to know the datetime data class statically, which makes it hard to use.\r\n\r\nThis PR improves the `CatalystTypeConverters` for date/timestamp, to support the old and new Java time classes at the same time.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nMake `CatalystTypeConverters` easier to use.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

changes were proposed in this pull request?**\r\nThe original Spark UI on SHS does not have a specific way to explore accumulators information, this data is scattered across stages which makes it difficult to access it.\r\n The accumulators information is located on the Stage Page, but this column is hard to read since it groups all the accumulators names and values for a specific task. This is one of the reasons why understanding the changes of counters from a job can become a difficult task.\r\nThe proposed change creates an explore page for Accumulators on the SparkUI. The information will be located under a new tab that has an overview page with links to check for more details about the accumulators information by a particular name or stage.\r\n[Community discussion on accumulators page](http://apache-spark-developers-list.1001551.n3.nabble.com/accumulators-td8814.html)\r\n\r\n**Why are the changes needed?**\r\nA page that allows users to explore accumulators information is a helpful feature for users because currently the information is scattered across stages and the display on the Stages Page is difficult to read. This page offers easy access to accumulators information in detail which translates into a better user experience and an increased velocity to solve problems and track accumulator changes.\r\n\r\n**Does this PR introduce user-facing change?**\r\nYes. A new tab will be added to the Spark UI and three new pages will dependent on it.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"889\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-04-09 at 3 05 39 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45573418/115795081-15b31300-a384-11eb-88c2-56d7454faee5.png\">\r\n\r\n **How was this patch tested?**\r\nThis patch was tested manually by using real spark event logs from a Spark History Server on a production cluster.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR adds support for lateral subqueries. A lateral subquery is a subquery preceded by the `LATERAL` keyword in the FROM clause of a query that can reference columns in the preceding FROM items. For example:\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT * FROM t1, LATERAL (SELECT * FROM t2 WHERE t1.a = t2.c)\r\n```\r\nA new subquery expression`LateralSubquery` is used to represent a lateral subquery. It is similar to `ScalarSubquery` but can return multiple rows and columns. A new logical unary node `LateralJoin` is used to represent a lateral join.\r\n\r\nHere is the analyzed plan for the above query:\r\n```scala\r\nProject [a, b, c, d]\r\n+- LateralJoin lateral-subquery [a], Inner\r\n   :  +- Project [c, d]\r\n   :     +- Filter (outer(a) = c)\r\n   :        +- Relation [c, d]\r\n   +- Relation [a, b]\r\n```\r\n\r\nSimilar to a correlated subquery, a lateral subquery can be viewed as a dependent (nested loop) join where the evaluation of the right subtree depends on the current value of the left subtree.  The same technique to decorrelate a subquery is used to decorrelate a lateral join:\r\n```scala\r\nProject [a, b, c, d]\r\n+- LateralJoin lateral-subquery [a && a = c], Inner  // pull up correlated predicates as join conditions\r\n   :  +- Project [c, d]\r\n   :     +- Relation [c, d]\r\n   +- Relation [a, b]\r\n```\r\nThen the lateral join can be rewritten into a normal join:\r\n```scala\r\nJoin Inner (a = c)\r\n:- Relation [a, b]\r\n+- Relation [c, d]\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Follow-ups:\r\n1. Similar to rewriting correlated scalar subqueries, rewriting lateral joins is also subject to the COUNT bug (See SPARK-15370 for more details). This is **not** handled in the current PR as it requires a sizeable amount of refactoring. It will be addressed in a subsequent PR (SPARK-35551).\r\n2. Currently Spark does use outer query references to resolve star expressions in subqueries. This is not lateral subquery specific and can be handled in a separate PR (SPARK-35618)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo support an ANSI SQL feature.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. It allows users to use lateral subqueries in the FROM clause of a query.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Parser test: `PlanParserSuite.scala`\r\n- Analyzer test: `ResolveSubquerySuite.scala`\r\n- Optimizer test: `PullupCorrelatedPredicatesSuite.scala`\r\n- SQL test: `join-lateral.sql`,

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nMove the following classes:\r\n- `InMemoryAtomicPartitionTable`\r\n- `InMemoryPartitionTable`\r\n- `InMemoryPartitionTableCatalog`\r\n- `InMemoryTable`\r\n- `InMemoryTableCatalog`\r\n- `StagingInMemoryTableCatalog`\r\n\r\nfrom `org.apache.spark.sql.connector` to `org.apache.spark.sql.connector.catalog`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThese classes implement catalog related interfaces but reside in `org.apache.spark.sql.connector`. A more suitable place should be `org.apache.spark.sql.connector.catalog`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

PR provides an overloaded version of `JacksonGenerator` constructor that accepts a custom `JsonGenerator` instead of `java.io.Writer`. This would enable the use of `JacksonGenerator` with any [Jackson binary dataformat](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-binary).\r\nThose Jackson implementations mostly do not have support for `com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonFactory#createGenerator(java.io.Writer)`, but only for `com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonFactory#createGenerator(java.io.OutputStream)`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis would be beneficial for datasources implementations, which need to convert data to any Jackson binary dataformat, since they could reuse `JacksonGenerator` type mappings.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nI added a positive unit

It is a variant of [q9.sql](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/test/resources/tpcds/q9.sql) using CTE.\r\nThe performance improvement in case of `q9` comes from merging 15 subqueries into 5 and in case of `q9b` it comes from merging 5 subqueries into 1.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo. But this optimization can be disabled with `spark.sql.optimizer.excludedRules` config.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting and new UTs.\r\n","created_at":"2021-04-22T14:08:16Z","updated_at":"2022-04-26T13:15:45Z","closed_at":"2022-04-20T13:37:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8deb6f8d195bf14d15026817a135787204d5e5e9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32298/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32298/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/32298/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2590edf74f78096249b31dffae6ff94f293fc78d","head":{"label":"peter-toth:SPARK-34079-multi-column-scalar-subquery","ref":"SPARK-34079-multi-column-scalar-subquery","sha":"2590edf74f78096249b31dffae6ff94f293fc78d","user":{"login":"peter-toth","id":7253827,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNTM4Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7253827?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth","html_url":"https://github.com/peter-toth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":130546049,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzA1NDYwNDk=","name":"spark","full_name":"peter-toth/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"peter-toth","id":7253827,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNTM4Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7253827?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth","html_url":"https://github.com/peter-toth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/peter-toth/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIn Spark 3.2, `String_Column - Date_Column` will cause an analysis exception instead of implicitly converting the first column as Date Type. This is to make it consistent with the behavior of `String_Column - Timestamp_Column`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently, `String_Column - Timestamp_Column` throws an analysis exception, while `String_Column - Date_Column` converts the `String_Column` to Date type. \r\nWe need to make them consistent.\r\nVerified on PostgreSQL and Oracle, such conversion is not supported either. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, `String_Column - Date_Column` will raise an error. Users need to add an explicit conversion to make it work.\r\nBefore the code changes the subtractions are inconsistent:\r\n```\r\n> create table foo(s string);\r\n> select s - Date'2021-01-01' from foo;\r\n1\r\n> select s - Timestamp'2021-01-01 00:00:00' from foo;\r\nError in query: argument 1 requires timestamp type\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter the code changes:\r\n```\r\n> create table foo(s string);\r\n> select s - Date'2021-01-01' from foo;\r\nError in query: argument 1 requires date type\r\n> select s - Timestamp'2021-01-01 00:00:00' from foo;\r\nError in query: argument 1 requires timestamp type\r\n```\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdd New SQL functions: \r\n* TRY_ADD\r\n* TRY_DIVIDE\r\n\r\nThese expressions are identical to the following expression under ANSI mode except that it returns null if error occurs:\r\n* ADD\r\n* DIVIDE\r\n\r\nNote: it is easy to add other expressions like `TRY_SUBTRACT`/`TRY_MULTIPLY` but let's control the number of these new expressions and just add `TRY_ADD` and `TRY_DIVIDE` for now.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n1. Users can manage to finish queries without interruptions in ANSI mode.\r\n2. Users can get NULLs instead of unreasonable results if overflow occurs when ANSI mode is off.\r\nFor example, the behavior of the following SQL operations is unreasonable:\r\n```\r\n2147483647 + 2 => -2147483647\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith the new safe version SQL functions:\r\n```\r\nTRY_ADD(2147483647, 2) => null\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: **We should only add new expressions to important operators, instead of adding new safe expressions for all the expressions that can throw errors.** \r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, new SQL functions: TRY_ADD/TRY_DIVIDE\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR improves `Distinct` statistics estimation by rewrite it to `Aggregate`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n1. The current implementation will lack column statistics.\r\n2. Some rules before the `ReplaceDistinctWithAggregate` may use it. For example: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/31113/files#diff-11264d807efa58054cca2d220aae8fba644ee0f0f2a4722c46d52828394846efR1808\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing

hongdd <hongdongdong@cmss.chinamobile.com>\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSupporting SparkAppHandle object to be able to manage a running Spark application on Kubernetes. It can be used to monitor the application changes and to stop the application by pod deletion.\r\n\r\nThis Pull Request has been raised due to a inactivity of a previous one - #30520\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThere is an inconsistency in the Spark application managing with SparkAppHandle object between Kubernetes and other resource managers such as Yarn/Mesos.\r\n\r\nCurrently, this feature is not properly implemented on Kubernetes which may cause some issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, it changes the behavior of `SparkAppHandle` object which the user may use to communicate with the launched Spark application.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to support driver-owned on-demand PVC(Persistent Volume Claim)s. It means dynamically-created PVCs will have the `ownerReference` to `driver` pod instead of `executor` pod.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis allows K8s backend scheduler can reuse this later.\r\n\r\n**BEFORE**\r\n```\r\n$ k get pvc tpcds-pvc-exec-1-pvc-0 -oyaml\r\napiVersion: v1\r\nkind: PersistentVolumeClaim\r\nmetadata:\r\n...\r\n  ownerReferences:\r\n  - apiVersion: v1\r\n

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes a workaround to address the Netty OOM issue (SPARK-24989, SPARK-27991):\r\n\r\nBasically, `ShuffleBlockFetcherIterator` would catch the `OutOfDirectMemoryError` from Netty and then set a global flag for the shuffle module. Any pending fetch requests would be deferred if there're in-flight requests until the flag is unset. And the flag will be unset when there's a fetch request succeed.\r\n\r\nNote that catching the Netty OOM rather than abort the application is feasible because Netty manage its own memory region (offheap by default) separately. So Netty OOM doesn't mean the memory shortage of Spark.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe Netty OOM issue is a very corner case. It usually happens in the large-scale cluster, where a reduce task could fetch shuffle blocks from hundreds of nodes concurrently in a short time. Internally, we found a cluster that has created 260+ clients within 6s before throwing Netty OOM. \r\n\r\nAlthough Spark has configurations, e.g., `spark.reducer.maxReqsInFlight` to tune the number of concurrent requests, it's usually not a easy decision for the user to set a reasonable value regarding the workloads, machine resources, etc. But with this fix, Spark would heal the Netty memory issue itself without any specific configurations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded unit tests.\r\n","created_at":"2021-04-22T05:48:56Z","updated_at":"2023-05-30T11:18:37Z","closed_at":"2021-05-20T04:27:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0acdf9bd7ddb6838dbd2251f7f2ebb87b9628f8c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32287/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32287/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/32287/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4af6ee73221a55e3cd7239f151ec33d5e802cbe4","head":{"label":"Ngone51:SPARK-27991","ref":"SPARK-27991","sha":"4af6ee73221a55e3cd7239f151ec33d5e802cbe4","user":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":114185286,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTQxODUyODY=","name":"spark","full_name":"Ngone51/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to use `zstd` as `spark.io.compression.codec` instead of `lz4` in order to reduce the disk IOs and traffic during shuffle processing and  worker decommission storage migration (between executors and to external storage).\r\n\r\n- Since SPARK-29434 and SPARK-29576, Apache Spark 3.0+ uses ZSTD `spark.shuffle.mapStatus.compression.codec` by default instead of `GZIP`.\r\n- Since SPARK-34503, Apache Spark 3.2 uses ZSTD for `spark.eventLog.compression.codec` by default instead of `LZ4`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo reduce the disk footprint. For TPCDS 3TB case, `zstd` has 44% less shuffle write size and 43% less shuffle read size\r\nFor some cases, the query execution with `zstd` io is 20% faster than `lz4` io.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs.","created_at":"2021-04-22T05:26:14Z","updated_at":"2021-10-13T00:09:55Z","closed_at":"2021-10-13T00:09:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"650bb84c8ed00807e01ba8e8c3692e9d50ee5963","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32286/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32286/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/32286/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/15c5818eb102fd2567d65d1cae6ea7417a6d3921","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-35181","ref":"SPARK-35181","sha":"15c5818eb102fd2567d65d1cae6ea7417a6d3921","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"95d94948c58593c72bf4add58624b0e8b305953a","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nClose SparkContext after the Main method has finished, to allow SparkApplication on K8S to complete.\r\nThis is fixed version of [merged and reverted PR](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/32081).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nif I don't call the method sparkContext.stop() explicitly, then a Spark driver process doesn't terminate even after its Main method has been completed. This behaviour is different from spark on yarn, where the manual sparkContext stopping is not required. It looks like, the problem is in using non-daemon threads, which prevent the driver jvm process from terminating.\r\nSo I have inserted code that closes sparkContext automatically.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManually on the production AWS EKS environment in my company.\r\n","created_at":"2021-04-22T02:16:20Z","updated_at":"2023-01-27T21:41:37Z","closed_at":"2021-04-22T05:54:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0a71dd5a3da0a9ae3d42b28b1e824777fd037dde","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32283/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32283/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/32283/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/814e391a0f7df53c7a1ad96c895c80f5745e591e","head":{"label":"kotlovs:close-spark-context-on-exit-2","ref":"close-spark-context-on-exit-2","sha":"814e391a0f7df53c7a1ad96c895c80f5745e591e","user":{"login":"kotlovs","id":47977899,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3OTc3ODk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47977899?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kotlovs","html_url":"https://github.com/kotlovs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kotlovs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kotlovs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kotlovs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kotlovs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kotlovs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kotlovs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kotlovs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kotlovs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kotlovs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355531719,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1MzE3MTk=","name":"spark","full_name":"kotlovs/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kotlovs","id":47977899,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3OTc3ODk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47977899?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kotlovs","html_url":"https://github.com/kotlovs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kotlovs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kotlovs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kotlovs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kotlovs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kotlovs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kotlovs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kotlovs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kotlovs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kotlovs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kotlovs/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe test added by #31797 has the [failure](https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/SparkPullRequestBuilder/137741/testReport/org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.optimizer/ReplaceNullWithFalseInPredicateSuite/SPARK_34692__Support_Not_Int__and_Not_InSet__propagate_null/). This is a followup to fix it.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nDue to #32157, the rule `ReplaceNullWithFalseInPredicate` will check tree pattern before actually doing transformation. As `null` in `INSET` is not `NULL_LITERAL` pattern, we miss it and fail the newly added `not inset ...` check in `replaceNullWithFalse`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nExisting unit tests.","created_at":"2021-04-21T23:30:32Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:24:59Z","closed_at":"2021-04-22T02:06:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"529a5e0bd95dc8d2015dc61f8415953566d24d66","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32278/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32278/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/32278/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f707ec1790b631563b313bcc33758fed1116a177","head":{"label":"viirya:SPARK-34692-followup","ref":"SPARK-34692-followup","sha":"f707ec1790b631563b313bcc33758fed1116a177","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR added the multiple columns adding support for PySpark.dataframe.withColumn.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nNow, the spark private method `withColumns` can add columns at one pass [1]:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/b5241c97b17a1139a4ff719bfce7f68aef094d95/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/Dataset.scala#L2402\r\nbut the PySpark user can only use `withColumn` to add one column or replacing the existing one column that has the same name. \r\n\r\nFor example, if the PySpark user want to add multiple columns, they should call `withColumn` again and again like:\r\n```Python\r\nself.df.withColumn(\"key1\", col(\"key1\")).withColumn(\"key2\", col(\"key2\")).withColumn(\"key3\", col(\"key3\"))\r\n```\r\nAfter this patch, the user can use the `withColumn` with columns list args complete columns adding at one pass:\r\n```Python\r\nself.df.withColumn([\"key1\", \"key2\", \"key3\"], [col(\"key1\"), col(\"key2\"), col(\"key3\")])\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR proposes to add linter for JavaScript source files.\r\n[ESLint](https://eslint.org/) seems to be a popular linter for JavaScript so I choose it.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nLinter enables us to check style and keeps code clean.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nManually run `dev/lint-js` (Node.js and npm are required).\r\n\r\nIn this PR, mainly indentation style is also fixed an linter passes.","created_at":"2021-04-21T12:52:39Z","updated_at":"2021-05-07T14:30:14Z","closed_at":"2021-05-07T12:55:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ddb94f03d3340b18bfd312f0d6779d31cabb991c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605079,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDc5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/WEB%20UI","name":"WEB

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nInitial implementation of RocksDBCheckpointMetadata. It persists the metadata for RocksDBFileManager.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe RocksDBCheckpointMetadata persists the metadata for each committed batch in JSON format. The object contains all RocksDB file names and the number of total keys.\r\nThe metadata binds closely with the directory structure of RocksDBFileManager, as described in the design doc - [Directory Structure and Format for Files stored in DFS](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10wVGaUorgPt4iVe4phunAcjU924fa3-_Kf29-2nxH6Y/edit#heading=h.zgvw85ijoz2).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to override the `sql` and `toString` methods of the expressions that implement operators over ANSI intervals (`YearMonthIntervalType`/`DayTimeIntervalType`), and replace internal expression class names by operators like `*`, `/` and `-`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nProposed methods should make the textual representation of such operators more readable, and potentially parsable by Spark SQL parser. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. This can influence on column names.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running existing test suites for interval and datetime expressions, and re-generating the `*.sql` tests:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/testOnly *SQLQueryTestSuite -- -z interval.sql\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/testOnly *SQLQueryTestSuite -- -z datetime.sql\"\r\n```","created_at":"2021-04-20T15:55:43Z","updated_at":"2021-04-21T08:32:45Z","closed_at":"2021-04-20T20:14:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4f51148adec6314ee711aa7a2e69e9fb50b9049e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32262/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32262/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/32262/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9bdfe66b61b74f4d5c83984eef1b07c6dd665628","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:interval-operator-sql","ref":"interval-operator-sql","sha":"9bdfe66b61b74f4d5c83984eef1b07c6dd665628","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

With this PR, I integrate work done in the [`dev.ludovic.netlib`](https://github.com/luhenry/netlib/) Maven package.\r\n\r\nThe `dev.ludovic.netlib` library wraps the original `com.github.fommil.netlib` library and focus on accelerating the linear algebra routines in use in Spark. When running the `org.apache.spark.ml.linalg.BLASBenchmark` benchmarking suite, I get the results at [1] on an Intel machine. Moreover, this library is thoroughly tested to return the exact same results as the reference implementation.\r\n\r\nUnder the hood, it reimplements the necessary algorithms in pure autovectorization-friendly Java 8, as well as takes advantage of the Vector API and Foreign Linker API introduced in JDK 16 when available.\r\n\r\nA table summarising which version gets loaded in which case:\r\n\r\n```\r\n|                       | BLAS.nativeBLAS                                    | BLAS.javaBLAS                                      |\r\n| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |\r\n| with -Pnetlib-lgpl    | 1. dev.ludovic.netlib.blas.NetlibNativeBLAS, a     | 1. dev.ludovic.netlib.blas.VectorizedBLAS          |\r\n|                       |     wrapper for com.github.fommil:all              |    (JDK16+, relies on the Vector API, requires     |\r\n|                       | 2. dev.ludovic.netlib.blas.ForeignBLAS (JDK16+,    |     `--add-modules=jdk.incubator.vector` on JDK16) |\r\n|                       |    relies on the Foreign Linker API, requires      | 2. dev.ludovic.netlib.blas.Java11BLAS (JDK11+)     |\r\n|                       |    `--add-modules=jdk.incubator.foreign            | 3. dev.ludovic.netlib.blas.JavaBLAS                |\r\n|                       |     -Dforeign.restricted=warn`)                    | 4. dev.ludovic.netlib.blas.NetlibF2jBLAS, a        |\r\n|                       | 3. fails to load, falls back to BLAS.javaBLAS in   |     wrapper for com.github.fommil:core             |\r\n|                       |     org.apache.spark.ml.linalg.BLAS                |                                                    |\r\n| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |\r\n| without -Pnetlib-lgpl | 1. dev.ludovic.netlib.blas.ForeignBLAS (JDK16+,    | 1. dev.ludovic.netlib.blas.VectorizedBLAS          |\r\n|                       |    relies on the Foreign Linker API, requires      |    (JDK16+, relies on the Vector API, requires     |\r\n|                       |    `--add-modules=jdk.incubator.foreign            |     `--add-modules=jdk.incubator.vector` on JDK16) |\r\n|                       |     -Dforeign.restricted=warn`)                    | 2. dev.ludovic.netlib.blas.Java11BLAS (JDK11+)     |\r\n|                       | 2. fails to load, falls back to BLAS.javaBLAS in   | 3. dev.ludovic.netlib.blas.JavaBLAS                |\r\n|                       |     org.apache.spark.ml.linalg.BLAS                | 4. dev.ludovic.netlib.blas.NetlibF2jBLAS, a        |\r\n|                       |                                                    |     wrapper for com.github.fommil:core             |\r\n| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n`CurrentOrigin` is a thread-local variable to track the original SQL line position in plan/expression. Usually, we set `CurrentOrigin`, create `TreeNode` instances, and reset `CurrentOrigin`.\r\n\r\nThis PR updates the last step to set `CurrentOrigin` to its previous value, instead of resetting it. This is necessary when we invoke `CurrentOrigin` in a nested way, like with subqueries.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo keep the original SQL line position in the error message in more cases.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo, only minor error message changes.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdded the following TreePattern enums:\r\n- DYNAMIC_PRUNING_SUBQUERY\r\n- EXISTS_SUBQUERY\r\n- IN_SUBQUERY\r\n- LIST_SUBQUERY\r\n- PLAN_EXPRESSION\r\n- SCALAR_SUBQUERY\r\n- FILTER\r\n\r\nUsed them in the following rules:\r\n- ResolveSubquery\r\n- UpdateOuterReferences\r\n- OptimizeSubqueries\r\n- RewritePredicateSubquery\r\n- PullupCorrelatedPredicates\r\n- RewriteCorrelatedScalarSubquery (not the rule itself but an internal transform call, the full support is in SPARK-35148)\r\n- InsertAdaptiveSparkPlan\r\n- PlanAdaptiveSubqueries\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nReduce the number of tree traversals and hence improve the query compilation latency.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-04-20T06:10:06Z","updated_at":"2021-04-23T04:43:18Z","closed_at":"2021-04-23T04:43:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"356229e7e82d0775040d78ac7cbaa3b615114c38","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32247/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32247/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/32247/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/41270b60f210e392eb90984a000a66d9fe9e5b2a","head":{"label":"sigmod:subquery","ref":"subquery","sha":"41270b60f210e392eb90984a000a66d9fe9e5b2a","user":{"login":"sigmod","id":384788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDc4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/384788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmod","html_url":"https://github.com/sigmod","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmod/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmod/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmod/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmod/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmod/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmod/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmod/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmod/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmod/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355067050,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTUwNjcwNTA=","name":"spark","full_name":"sigmod/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sigmod","id":384788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDc4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/384788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmod","html_url":"https://github.com/sigmod","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmod/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmod/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmod/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmod/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmod/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmod/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmod/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmod/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmod/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sigmod/spark","description":"Apache
