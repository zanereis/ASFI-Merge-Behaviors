What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\n`CreateHiveTableAsSelectLogicalPlan` is a Hive-specific logical node. This is not a good design. We need to consolidate it with `CreateTableUsingAsSelect` to build a unified logical node `CreateTableAsSelect`.\n\nThe first step is to make more general the signature of `CreateTableUsingAsSelect` by using `CatalogTable` as the input of Table metadata. The logical node is renamed to `CreateTableAsSelect`. The new interface will be like\n\n``` Scala\ncase class CreateTableAsSelect(\n    tableDesc: CatalogTable,\n    provider: String,\n    mode: SaveMode,\n    child: LogicalPlan) extends logical.UnaryNode \n```\n\nThe second step is to convert `CreateHiveTableAsSelectLogicalPlan` into `CreateTableAsSelect`.  \n\nThis PR is based on the compare of the two interfaces. The details are described below.\n\nCurrently, the SQL interface is the only only entrance to `CreateHiveTableAsSelectLogicalPlan`. Below describes the correspondence between the SQL interface and `CreateHiveTableAsSelectLogicalPlan`\n\n``` Scala\ncase class CreateHiveTableAsSelectLogicalPlan(\n    tableDesc: CatalogTable,\n    child: LogicalPlan,\n    allowExisting: Boolean)\n    extends UnaryNode with Command \n```\n\n``` Scala\nSQL:\n\nWhen conf.convertCTAS == false || either [ROW FORMAT row_format] or [STORED AS file_format] is specified\n\n  CREATE [EXTERNAL] [TEMPORARY] TABLE [IF NOT EXISTS] [db_name.]table_name\n  [(col1[:] data_type [COMMENT col_comment], ...)]\n  [COMMENT table_comment]\n  [PARTITIONED BY (col2[:] data_type [COMMENT col_comment], ...)]\n  [ROW FORMAT row_format]\n  [STORED AS file_format]\n  [LOCATION path]\n  [TBLPROPERTIES (property_name=property_value, ...)]\n  [AS select_statement];\n\n  -->\n\n  [TEMPORARY] is not allowed.\n\n  allowExisting: Boolean = [IF NOT EXISTS]\n  child: LogicalPlan = select_statement\n  tableDesc: CatalogTable = CatalogTable(\n    identifier = [db_name.]table_name,\n    tableType = [EXTERNAL],\n    storage = [ROW FORMAT row_format +\n              [STORED AS file_format] +\n              [LOCATION path],\n    schema = Seq.empty,\n    partitionColumnNames = Seq.empty,\n    properties = [TBLPROPERTIES (property_name=property_value, ...)],\n    comment = [COMMENT table_comment])\n```\n\n`CreateTableUsingAsSelect` has three entrances. Below is the the correspondence:\n\n``` Scala\ncase class CreateTableUsingAsSelect(\n    tableIdent: TableIdentifier,\n    provider: String,\n    partitionColumns: Array[String],\n    bucketSpec: Option[BucketSpec],\n    mode: SaveMode,\n    options: Map[String, String],\n    child: LogicalPlan) extends logical.UnaryNode \n```\n\n``` Scala\nSQL Interface I:\n\nWhen conf.convertCTAS == true && [ROW FORMAT row_format] and [STORED AS file_format] are not specified\n\n  CREATE [EXTERNAL] [TEMPORARY] TABLE [IF NOT EXISTS] [db_name.]table_name\n  [(col1[:] data_type [COMMENT col_comment], ...)]\n  [COMMENT table_comment]\n  [PARTITIONED BY (col2[:] data_type [COMMENT col_comment], ...)]\n  [ROW FORMAT row_format]\n  [STORED AS file_format]\n  [LOCATION path]\n  [TBLPROPERTIES (property_name=property_value, ...)]\n  [AS select_statement];\n\n  --> \n\n  tableIdent: TableIdentifier = [db_name.]table_name,\n  provider: String = conf.defaultDataSourceName,\n  partitionColumns: Array[String] = Seq.empty,\n  bucketSpec: Option[BucketSpec] = None,\n  mode: SaveMode = [IF NOT EXISTS],\n  options: Map[String, String] = [LOCATION path],\n  child: LogicalPlan = [AS select_statement]\n```\n\n``` Scala\nSQL Interface II:\n\n  CREATE [EXTERNAL] [TEMPORARY] TABLE [IF NOT EXISTS] [db_name.]table_name\n  [(col1[:] data_type [COMMENT col_comment], ...)]\n  USING qualifiedName\n  [OPTIONS tablePropertyList)]\n  [PARTITIONED BY (col2[:] data_type [COMMENT col_comment], ...)]\n  [CLUSTERED BY (col3, ...) (SORTED BY orderedIdentifierList)? INTO INTEGER_VALUE BUCKETS]\n  [AS select_statement];\n\n  -->\n\n  [EXTERNAL] is not allowed.\n  [TEMPORARY] is not allowed.\n\n  tableIdent: TableIdentifier = [db_name.]table_name,\n  provider: String = USING qualifiedName,\n  partitionColumns: Array[String] = [PARTITIONED BY (col2[:] data_type [COMMENT col_comment], ...)],\n  bucketSpec: Option[BucketSpec] = [CLUSTERED BY (col3, ...) (SORTED BY orderedIdentifierList)? INTO INTEGER_VALUE BUCKETS],\n  mode: SaveMode = [IF NOT EXISTS],\n  options: Map[String, String] = [OPTIONS tablePropertyList)],\n  child: LogicalPlan = [AS select_statement]\n```\n\n``` Scala\nDataFrameWriter Interface:\n\n  tableIdent: TableIdentifier = tableIdent (from saveAsTable API),\n  provider: String = source (from format API),\n  partitionColumns: Array[String] = partitioningColumns (from partitionBy API),\n  bucketSpec: Option[BucketSpec] = getBucketSpec function (from bucketBy API and sortBy API),\n  mode: SaveMode = mode (from mode API),\n  options: Map[String, String] = extraOptions (from option and options API),\n  child: LogicalPlan = df.logicalPlan (from DataFrameWriter)\n```\n#### How was this patch tested?\n\nThe existing test cases cover the code refactoring\n","created_at":"2016-07-10T07:42:25Z","updated_at":"2016-08-04T19:30:59Z","closed_at":"2016-08-04T19:30:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6d2ac6af1aedf539459af8808901460659dfb6a4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14123/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14123/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14123/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/082040f64130795593d551647f4d451a0b6a9a7e","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:removeHiveCTASLogicalNode","ref":"removeHiveCTASLogicalNode","sha":"082040f64130795593d551647f4d451a0b6a9a7e","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWhen doing a CTAS with a Partition By clause, we got a wrong error message.\n\nFor example,\n\n``` SQL\nCREATE TABLE gen__tmp\nPARTITIONED BY (key string)\nAS SELECT key, value FROM mytable1\n```\n\nThe error message we get now is like\n\n```\nOperation not allowed: Schema may not be specified in a Create Table As Select (CTAS) statement(line 2, pos 0)\n```\n\nHowever, based on the code, the message we should get is like\n\n```\nOperation not allowed: A Create Table As Select (CTAS) statement is not allowed to create a partitioned table using Hive's file formats. Please use the syntax of \"CREATE TABLE tableName USING dataSource OPTIONS (...)

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIn our case, we are implementing a new mechanism which will let driver survive when cluster is temporarily down and restarting. So when the service provided by cluster is not available, scheduler should stop scheduling new tasks. I added a hook inside CoarseGrainedSchedulerBackend class, in order to avoid new task scheduling when it's necessary.\n\nJIRA link:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nSimilar to `LogisticAggregator`, `LeastSquaresAggregator` used for linear regression ends up serializing the coefficients and the features standard deviations, which is not necessary and can cause performance issues for high dimensional data. This patch removes this serialization.\n\nIn https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/13729 the approach was to pass these values directly to the add method. The approach used here, initially, is to mark these fields as transient instead which gives the benefit of keeping the signature of the add method simple and interpretable. The downside is that it requires the use of `@transient lazy val`s which are difficult to reason about if one is not quite familiar with serialization in Scala/Spark. \n## How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently, `JacksonParser.parse` is doing type-based dispatch for each row to convert the tokens to appropriate values for Spark.\nIt might not have to be done like this because the schema is already kept.\n\nSo, appropriate converters can be created first according to the schema once, and then apply them to each row. \n\nThis PR corrects `JacksonParser` so that it creates all converters for the schema once and then applies them to each row rather than type dispatching for every row.\n\nBenchmark was proceeded with the codes

Summary\n\nAdd a new transformation method `transformInstance` that operates on single instances. This method can reduce the latency of predictions by 200x for typical ML tasks which facilitates serving models in production. See the [JIRA ticket](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-16431) for details.\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrent feature transformers in spark.ml can only operate on DataFrames and don't have a method that accepts single instances. A typical transformer has a User-Defined Function (udf) in its `transform` method which includes a set of operations on the features of a single instance:\n\n```\nval column_operation = udf {operations on single instance}\n```\n\nAdding a new method called `transformInstance` that operates directly on single instances and using it in the udf instead can be useful:\n\n```\ndef transformInstance(features: featuresType): OutputType = {operations on single instance}\n\nval column_operation = udf {transformInstance}\n```\n\nPredictors also don't have a public method that does predictions on single instances. `transformInstance` can be easily added to predictors by acting as a wrapper for the internal method predict (which takes features as input).\n\nThe proposed method in this change is added to all predictors and feature transformers except OnehotEncoder, VectorSlicer, and Word2Vec, which might require bigger changes due to dependencies on the dataset's schema (they can be fixed using simple hacks but this needs to be discussed)\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nThe current tests for transformers and predictors, which invoke `transformInstance` internally, passed.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nAn option that limits the file stream source to read 1 file at a time enables rate limiting.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis uses the try/finally pattern to ensure streams are closed after use. `UnsafeShuffleWriter` wasn't closing compression streams, causing them to leak resources until garbage collected. This was causing a problem with codecs that use off-heap memory.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nCurrent tests are sufficient. This should not change behavior.\n","created_at":"2016-07-07T16:38:48Z","updated_at":"2016-07-08T19:39:20Z","closed_at":"2016-07-08T19:39:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"22a33121567065ab4a166a90162db6a0d07658ee","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14093/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14093/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14093/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/661539f82ef924cfa4fe8a43f570c1a93dac816f","head":{"label":"rdblue:SPARK-16420-unsafe-shuffle-writer-leak","ref":"SPARK-16420-unsafe-shuffle-writer-leak","sha":"661539f82ef924cfa4fe8a43f570c1a93dac816f","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":26284539,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjI4NDUzOQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"rdblue/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nEnsureRequirements compares the required and given sort ordering, but uses Scala equals instead of a semantic equals, so column capitalization isn't considered, and also fails for a cached table. This results in a SortMergeJoin of a cached already-sorted table to add an extra sort.\n\nUsing semanticEquals to do the compare instead of scala equals on the two `Seq[SortOrder]`\n## How was this

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWaiting #11956 to be merged.\n\nThis PR generates Java code to directly get an array of each column from `CachedBatch` when `DataFrame.cache()` is called. This is done in whole stage code generation.\n\nWhen DataFrame.cache()`is called, data is stored as column-oriented storage (columnar cache) in`CachedBatch`. This PR avoid conversion from column-oriented storage to row-oriented storage. This PR handles an array type that is stored into a column. \n\nThis PR generates code both for row-oriented storage and column-oriented storage only if\n- `InMemoryColumnarTableScan` exists in a plan sub-tree. A decision is performed by checking an given iterator is `ColumnaIterator` at runtime\n- Sort or join does not exist in a plan sub-tree. \n\nThis PR generates Java code for columnar cache only if types in all columns, which are accessed in operations, are primitive or an array\n\nI will add benchmark suites into  [here](https://github.com/kiszk/spark/blob/SPARK-14098/sql/core/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/DataFrameCacheBenchmark.scala)\n\nMotivating example\n\n``` java\nval df =

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIn #13537 we truncate `simpleString` if it is a long `StructType`. But sometimes we need `catalogString` to reconstruct `TypeInfo`, for example in description of [SPARK-16415 ](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-16415). So we need to keep the implementation of `catalogString` not affected by our truncate.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nadded a test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR adds a boolean option, `truncate`, for `SaveMode.Overwrite` of JDBC DataFrameWriter. If this option is `true`, it try to take advantage of `TRUNCATE TABLE` instead of `DROP TABLE`. This is a trivial option, but will provide great **convenience** for BI tool users based on RDBMS tables generated by Spark.\n\n**Goal**\n- Without `CREATE/DROP` privilege, we can save dataframe to database. Sometime these are not allowed for security.\n- It will preserve the existing table information, so users can add and keep some additional `INDEX` and `CONSTRAINT`s for the table.\n- Sometime, `TRUNCATE` is faster than the combination of `DROP/CREATE`.\n\n**Supported DBMS**\nThe following is `truncate`-option support table. Due to the different behavior of `TRUNCATE TABLE` among DBMSs, it's not always safe to use `TRUNCATE TABLE`. Spark will ignore the `truncate` option for **unknown** and **some** DBMS with **default CASCADING** behavior. Newly added JDBCDialect should implement corresponding function to support `truncate` option additionally.\n\n| Spark Dialects | `truncate` OPTION SUPPORT |\n| --- | --- |\n| MySQLDialect | O |\n| PostgresDialect | X |\n| DB2Dialect | O |\n| MsSqlServerDialect | O |\n| DerbyDialect | O |\n| OracleDialect | O |\n\n**Before (TABLE with INDEX case)**: SparkShell & MySQL CLI are interleaved intentionally.\n\n``` scala\nscala> val (url, prop)=(\"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/temp?useSSL=false\", new java.util.Properties)\nscala> prop.setProperty(\"user\",\"root\")\nscala> df.write.mode(\"overwrite\").jdbc(url, \"table_with_index\", prop)\nscala> spark.range(10).write.mode(\"overwrite\").jdbc(url, \"table_with_index\", prop)\nmysql> DESC table_with_index;\n+-------+------------+------+-----+---------+-------+\n| Field | Type       | Null | Key | Default | Extra |\n+-------+------------+------+-----+---------+-------+\n| id    | bigint(20) | NO   |     | NULL    |       |\n+-------+------------+------+-----+---------+-------+\nmysql> CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_id ON table_with_index(id);\nmysql> DESC table_with_index;\n+-------+------------+------+-----+---------+-------+\n| Field | Type       | Null | Key | Default | Extra |\n+-------+------------+------+-----+---------+-------+\n| id    | bigint(20) | NO   | PRI | NULL    |       |\n+-------+------------+------+-----+---------+-------+\nscala> spark.range(10).write.mode(\"overwrite\").jdbc(url, \"table_with_index\", prop)\nmysql> DESC table_with_index;\n+-------+------------+------+-----+---------+-------+\n| Field | Type       | Null | Key | Default | Extra |\n+-------+------------+------+-----+---------+-------+\n| id    | bigint(20) | NO   |     | NULL    |       |\n+-------+------------+------+-----+---------+-------+\n```\n\n**After (TABLE with INDEX case)**\n\n``` scala\nscala> spark.range(10).write.mode(\"overwrite\").option(\"truncate\", true).jdbc(url, \"table_with_index\", prop)\nmysql> DESC table_with_index;\n+-------+------------+------+-----+---------+-------+\n| Field | Type       | Null | Key | Default | Extra |\n+-------+------------+------+-----+---------+-------+\n| id    | bigint(20) | NO   | PRI | NULL    |       |\n+-------+------------+------+-----+---------+-------+\n```\n\n**Error Handling**\n- In case of exceptions, Spark will not retry. Users should turn off the `truncate` option.\n- In case of schema change:\n  - If one of the column names changes, this will raise exceptions intuitively.\n  - If there exists only type difference, this will work like Append mode.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nPass the Jenkins tests with a updated

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis builds upon the blacklisting introduced in SPARK-17675 to add blacklisting of executors and nodes for an entire Spark application.  Resources are blacklisted based on tasks that fail, in tasksets that eventually complete successfully; they are automatically returned to the pool of active resources based on a timeout.  Full details are available in a design doc attached to the jira. \n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded unit tests, ran them via Jenkins, also ran a handful of them in a loop to check for flakiness.\n\nThe added tests include:\n- verifying BlacklistTracker works correctly\n- verifying TaskSchedulerImpl interacts with BlacklistTracker correctly (via a mock BlacklistTracker)\n- an integration test for the entire scheduler with blacklisting in a few different scenarios\n","created_at":"2016-07-06T22:26:00Z","updated_at":"2016-12-15T22:55:38Z","closed_at":"2016-12-15T18:12:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"34c90d88d15a92d6a27c3a34ccf4d055f32dc829","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14079/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14079/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14079/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f249b00e3eb64bf35ab836fa4b89eb961a9511a5","head":{"label":"squito:blacklist-SPARK-8425","ref":"blacklist-SPARK-8425","sha":"f249b00e3eb64bf35ab836fa4b89eb961a9511a5","user":{"login":"squito","id":71240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito","html_url":"https://github.com/squito","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":29212749,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTIxMjc0OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"squito/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"squito","id":71240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito","html_url":"https://github.com/squito","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/squito/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nBefore this PR, we are unable to call the `save` API of `DataFrameWriter` when the source is JDBC. For example, \n\n``` Scala\ndf.write\n  .format(\"jdbc\")\n  .option(\"url\", url1)\n  .option(\"dbtable\", \"TEST.TRUNCATETEST\")\n  .option(\"user\", \"testUser\")\n  .option(\"password\", \"testPass\")\n  .save() \n```\n\nThe error message users will get is like\n\n```\norg.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.jdbc.JdbcRelationProvider does not allow create table as select.\njava.lang.RuntimeException: org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.jdbc.JdbcRelationProvider does not allow create table as select.\n```\n\nAt the same time, users can do it for the other data sources, like `parquet`\n\nThis PR is to implement `createRelation` of `CreatableRelationProvider`. After the changes, we can use `save` API of `DataFrameWriter`. \n\nCloses #12601\n#### How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded test cases\n","created_at":"2016-07-06T21:28:30Z","updated_at":"2016-09-08T06:14:46Z","closed_at":"2016-09-08T06:14:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"478ba32247c9ad41a02f54ba77036e925b054af7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14077/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14077/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14077/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/07e316823ed17e89c3df0aaccf3fbb958afcfe3a","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:jdbcSave","ref":"jdbcSave","sha":"07e316823ed17e89c3df0aaccf3fbb958afcfe3a","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWhen users try to implement a data source API with extending only `RelationProvider` and `CreatableRelationProvider`, they will hit an error when resolving the relation.\n\n``` Scala\nspark.read\n.format(\"org.apache.spark.sql.test.DefaultSourceWithoutUserSpecifiedSchema\")\n  .load()\n  .write.\nformat(\"org.apache.spark.sql.test.DefaultSourceWithoutUserSpecifiedSchema\")\n  .save()\n```\n\nThe error they hit is like\n\n```\norg.apache.spark.sql.test.DefaultSourceWithoutUserSpecifiedSchema does not allow user-specified schemas.;\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: org.apache.spark.sql.test.DefaultSourceWithoutUserSpecifiedSchema does not allow user-specified schemas.;\n    at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.DataSource.resolveRelation(DataSource.scala:319)\n    at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.DataSource.write(DataSource.scala:494)\n    at org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrameWriter.save(DataFrameWriter.scala:211)\n```\n\nActually, the bug fix is simple. [`DataSource.createRelation(sparkSession.sqlContext, mode, options, data)`](https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark/blob/dd644f8117e889cebd6caca58702a7c7e3d88bef/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/datasources/DataSource.scala#L429) already returns a BaseRelation. We should not assign schema to `userSpecifiedSchema`. That schema assignment only makes sense for the data sources that extend `FileFormat`.\n#### How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded a test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\n`CatalogTable` is an internal interface to represent table metadata in Spark SQL, and should be able to express both hive serde table and data source table. Due to some hive hacks, data source table only use table properties to store its information, and the `CatalogStorageFormat` is very hive specific as it's only used by hive serde table currently.\n\nHowever this is not a good design, the `CatalogTable` is not general enough to express data source table if we remove hive hacks in the future.\n\nThis PR is trying to make `CatalogStorageFormat` general enough to handle all types of tables in Spark SQL.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nexisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThe commit https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/044971eca0ff3c2ce62afa665dbd3072d52cbbec introduced a lazy val to simplify code in Logging. Simple enough, though one side effect is that accessing log now means grabbing the instance's lock. This in turn turned up a form of deadlock in the Mesos code. It was arguably a bit of a problem in how this code is structured, but, in any event the safest thing to do seems to be to revert the commit, and that's 90% of the change here; it's just not worth the risk of similar more subtle issues.\n\nWhat I didn't revert here was the removal of this odd override of log in the Mesos code. In retrospect it might have been put in place at some stage as a defense against this type of problem. After all the Logging code still involved a lock at initialization before the change in question.\n\nEven after the revert, it doesn't seem like it does anything, given how Logging works now, so I left it removed. However, I also removed the particular log message that ended up playing a part in this problem anyway, maybe being paranoid, to make sure this type of problem can't happen even with how the current locking works in logging initialization.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nJenkins tests\n","created_at":"2016-07-06T10:53:47Z","updated_at":"2016-07-07T10:27:44Z","closed_at":"2016-07-06T20:37:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"27665dc097992446294161813750c2b7e67260ff","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14069/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14069/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14069/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8701b6c61233a89b1eb507154823a2e48ded0428","head":{"label":"srowen:SPARK-16379","ref":"SPARK-16379","sha":"8701b6c61233a89b1eb507154823a2e48ded0428","user":{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17241201,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzI0MTIwMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"srowen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/srowen/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWe have a use case of multiplying very big sparse matrices. we have about 1000x1000 distributed block matrices multiplication and the simulate multiply goes like O(n^4) (n being 1000). it takes about 1.5 hours. We modified it slightly with classical hashmap and now run in about 30 seconds O(n^2).\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nWe have added a performance test and verified the reduced time.\n","created_at":"2016-07-06T10:39:23Z","updated_at":"2016-07-26T20:47:29Z","closed_at":"2016-07-13T13:49:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9fe0f8571b0e2dd84a425892352f44bfb56c382d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14068/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14068/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14068/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3ae9ac74418b149d4dd82bf9c08199064874c807","head":{"label":"uzadude:master","ref":"master","sha":"3ae9ac74418b149d4dd82bf9c08199064874c807","user":{"login":"uzadude","id":15645757,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NjQ1NzU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15645757?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uzadude","html_url":"https://github.com/uzadude","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uzadude/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uzadude/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uzadude/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uzadude/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uzadude/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uzadude/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uzadude/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uzadude/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uzadude/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":62064979,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MjA2NDk3OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"uzadude/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"uzadude","id":15645757,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NjQ1NzU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15645757?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uzadude","html_url":"https://github.com/uzadude","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uzadude/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uzadude/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uzadude/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uzadude/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uzadude/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uzadude/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uzadude/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uzadude/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uzadude/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/uzadude/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently, if there is a schema as below:\n\n```\nroot\n  |-- _1: struct (nullable = true)\n  |    |-- _1: integer (nullable = true)\n```\n\nand if we execute the codes below:\n\n``` scala\ndf.filter(\"_1 IS NOT NULL\").count()\n```\n\nThis pushes down a filter although this filter is being applied to `StructType`.(If my understanding is correct, Spark does not pushes down filters for those).\n\nThe reason is, `ParquetFilters.getFieldMap` produces results below:\n\n```\n(_1,StructType(StructField(_1,IntegerType,true)))\n(_1,IntegerType)\n```\n\nand then it becomes a `Map`\n\n```\n(_1,IntegerType)\n```\n\nNow, because of `....lift(dataTypeOf(name)).map(_(name, value))`, this pushes down filters for `_1` which Parquet thinks is `IntegerType`. However, it is actually `StructType`.\n\nSo, Parquet filter2 produces incorrect results, for example, the codes below:\n\n```\ndf.filter(\"_1 IS NOT NULL\").count()\n```\n\nproduces always 0.\n\nThis PR prevents this by not finding nested fields.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit test in `ParquetFilterSuite`.\n","created_at":"2016-07-06T10:13:24Z","updated_at":"2018-01-02T03:40:08Z","closed_at":"2016-07-06T19:44:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"34f53ff6f48367a28e2d04579b325b706f1a209d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14067/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14067/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14067/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1300042fc266843b966923201f52e193e490ddaf","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-16371","ref":"SPARK-16371","sha":"1300042fc266843b966923201f52e193e490ddaf","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nAdd a configurable token manager for Spark on running on yarn.\n### Current Problems\n1. Supported token provider is hard-coded, currently only hdfs, hbase and hive are supported and it is impossible for user to add new token provider without code changes.\n2. Also this problem exits in timely token renewer and updater.\n### Changes In This Proposal\n\nIn this proposal, to address the problems mentioned above and make the current code more cleaner and easier to understand, mainly has 3 changes:\n1. Abstract a `ServiceTokenProvider` as well as `ServiceTokenRenewable` interface for token provider. Each service wants to communicate with Spark through token way needs to implement this interface. \n2. Provide a `ConfigurableTokenManager` to manage all the register token providers, also token renewer and updater. Also this class offers the API for other modules to obtain tokens, get renewal interval and so on.\n3. Implement 3 built-in token providers `HDFSTokenProvider`, `HiveTokenProvider` and `HBaseTokenProvider` to keep the same semantics as supported today. Whether to load in these built-in token providers is controlled by configuration \"spark.yarn.security.tokens.${service}.enabled\", by default for all the built-in token providers are loaded.\n### Behavior Changes\n\nFor the end user there's no behavior change, we still use the same configuration `spark.yarn.security.tokens.${service}.enabled` to decide which token provider is enabled (hbase or hive).\n\nFor user implemented token provider (assume the name of token provider is \"test\") needs to add into this class should have two configurations:\n1. `spark.yarn.security.tokens.test.enabled` to true\n2. `spark.yarn.security.tokens.test.class` to the full qualified class name.\n\nSo we still keep the same semantics as current code while add one new configuration.\n### Current Status\n- [x] token provider interface and management framework.\n- [x] implement built-in token providers (hdfs, hbase, hive).\n- [x] Coverage of unit test.\n- [x] Integrated test with security cluster.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit test and integrated test.\n\nPlease suggest and review, any comment is greatly

PR backports your fix (https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/13818) to branch 2.0.\n\nThis PR addresses [SPARK-15968](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-15968).\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThe `getCached` method of [HiveMetastoreCatalog](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/hive/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/hive/HiveMetastoreCatalog.scala) computes `pathsInMetastore` from the metastore relation's catalog table. This only returns the table base path, which is incomplete/inaccurate for a nonempty partitioned table. As a result, cached lookups on nonempty partitioned tables always miss.\n\nRather than get `pathsInMetastore` from\n\n```\nmetastoreRelation.catalogTable.storage.locationUri.toSeq\n```\n\nI modified the `getCached` method to take a `pathsInMetastore` argument. Calls to this method pass in the paths computed from calls to the Hive metastore. This is how `getCached` was implemented in Spark 1.5:\n\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/e0c3212a9b42e3e704b070da4ac25b68c584427f/sql/hive/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/hive/HiveMetastoreCatalog.scala#L444.\n\nI also added a call in `InsertIntoHiveTable.scala` to invalidate the table from the SQL session catalog.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nI've added a new unit test to `parquetSuites.scala`:\n\n```\nSPARK-15968: nonempty partitioned metastore Parquet table lookup should use cached relation\n```\n\nNote that the only difference between this new test and the one above it in the file is that the new test populates its partitioned table with a single value, while the existing test leaves the table empty. This reveals a subtle, unexpected hole in test coverage present before this patch.\n\nNote I also modified a different but related unit test in `parquetSuites.scala`:\n\n```\nSPARK-15248: explicitly added partitions should be readable\n```\n\nThis unit test asserts that Spark SQL should return data from a table partition which has been placed there outside a metastore query immediately after it is added. I changed the test so that, instead of adding the data as a parquet file saved in the partition's location, the data is added through a SQL `INSERT` query. I made this change because I could find no way to efficiently support partitioned table caching without failing that test.\n\nIn addition to my primary motivation, I can offer a few reasons I believe this is an acceptable weakening of that test. First, it still validates a fix for [SPARK-15248](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-15248), the issue for which it was written. Second, the assertion made is stronger than that required for non-partitioned tables. If you write data to the storage location of a non-partitioned metastore table without using a proper SQL DML query, a subsequent call to show that data will not return it. I believe this is an intentional limitation put in place to make table caching feasible, but I'm only speculating.\n\nBuilding a large `HadoopFsRelation` requires `stat`-ing all of its data files. In our environment, where we have tables with 10's of thousands of partitions, the difference between using a cached relation versus a new one is a matter of seconds versus minutes. Caching partitioned table metadata vastly improves the usability of Spark SQL for these

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR makes spark-sql (backed by SparkSQLCLIDriver) respects confs set by hiveconf, which is what we do in previous versions. The change is that when we start SparkSQLCLIDriver, we explicitly set confs set through --hiveconf to SQLContext's conf (basically treating those confs as a SparkSQL conf).\n## How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nDifferent from the other leaf nodes, `MetastoreRelation` and `SimpleCatalogRelation` have a pre-defined `alias`, which is used to change the qualifier of the node. However, based on the existing alias handling, alias should be put in `SubqueryAlias`. \n\nThis PR is to separate alias handling from `MetastoreRelation` and `SimpleCatalogRelation` to make it consistent with the other nodes. It simplifies the signature and conversion to a `BaseRelation`.\n\nFor example, below is an example query for `MetastoreRelation`,  which is converted to a `LogicalRelation`:\n\n``` SQL\nSELECT tmp.a + 1 FROM test_parquet_ctas tmp WHERE tmp.a > 2\n```\n\nBefore changes, the analyzed plan is\n\n```\n== Analyzed Logical Plan ==\n(a + 1): int\nProject [(a#951 + 1) AS (a + 1)#952]\n+- Filter (a#951 > 2)\n   +- SubqueryAlias tmp\n      +- Relation[a#951] parquet\n```\n\nAfter changes, the analyzed plan becomes\n\n```\n== Analyzed Logical Plan ==\n(a + 1): int\nProject [(a#951 + 1) AS (a + 1)#952]\n+- Filter (a#951 > 2)\n   +- SubqueryAlias tmp\n      +- SubqueryAlias test_parquet_ctas\n         +- Relation[a#951] parquet\n```\n\n**Note: the optimized plans are the same.**\n\nFor `SimpleCatalogRelation`, the existing code always generates two Subqueries. Thus, no change is needed.\n#### How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded test cases.\n","created_at":"2016-07-05T07:21:37Z","updated_at":"2016-07-07T04:09:12Z","closed_at":"2016-07-07T04:09:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a8301d3b149ab4117aae7f9eff73232e07ca626e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14053/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14053/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14053/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d54b605bc7ef6ba4d1ed14bfcc65fef075bb5e63","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:removeAliasFromMetastoreRelation","ref":"removeAliasFromMetastoreRelation","sha":"d54b605bc7ef6ba4d1ed14bfcc65fef075bb5e63","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR replaced #13218.\nCSRF prevention for REST APIs can be provided through a common servlet filter. This filter would check for the existence of an custom HTTP header - such as `X-XSRF-Header`.\nThe fact that CSRF attacks are entirely browser based means that the above approach can ensure that requests are coming from either: applications served by the same origin as the REST API or that there is explicit policy configuration that allows the setting of a header on XmlHttpRequest from another origin.\nWe have done similar work for Hadoop (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-12691) and other components.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit test.\n","created_at":"2016-07-05T05:17:31Z","updated_at":"2016-07-12T03:44:32Z","closed_at":"2016-07-12T03:44:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"927340ec39b0f5a5dc5ffa02cc95377819f3abad","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14052/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14052/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14052/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/fb610efc79352ca9b4501f40df629e6d127170d4","head":{"label":"yanboliang:csrf-rest","ref":"csrf-rest","sha":"fb610efc79352ca9b4501f40df629e6d127170d4","user":{"login":"yanboliang","id":1962026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjIwMjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1962026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang","html_url":"https://github.com/yanboliang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21890948,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTg5MDk0OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"yanboliang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yanboliang","id":1962026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjIwMjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1962026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang","html_url":"https://github.com/yanboliang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yanboliang/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nAn example that explains the usage of window functions. \nIt shows the difference between no/unbounded/bounded window frames and how they are resolved.\nThe example also embraces 2 ways to define window frames: based on physical (rowsBetween) and logical (rangeBetween) offsets.\n\nThe example should be useful for people who do not have much experience with window functions since it explains how Spark internally deals with window frames.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nThe existing tests were run, no failures. No additional test cases are needed.\n","created_at":"2016-07-04T22:34:39Z","updated_at":"2016-10-22T08:40:31Z","closed_at":"2016-10-22T08:40:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"359fc134389e84374e414ad1cd1455cb50df58d1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14050/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14050/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14050/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/fed17613e23c1634ae47542a00960dac77bc95fc","head":{"label":"aokolnychyi:window_function_examples","ref":"window_function_examples","sha":"fed17613e23c1634ae47542a00960dac77bc95fc","user":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":61945043,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MTk0NTA0Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"aokolnychyi/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently, Spark eagerly executes some queries with side effects like `Command`, `InsertIntoTable`, and `CreateTableUsingAsSelect`. However, it matches `UNION` queries **mistakenly** and executes **inconsistently**. This PR prevents **`UNION`** query eager execution to prevent inconsistency.\n\n``` scala\nscala> spark.emptyDataFrame.createOrReplaceTempView(\"empty\")\n\nscala> sql(\"CREATE TABLE tbl(i INT) USING

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWhen creating a view, a common user error is the number of columns produced by the `SELECT` clause does not match the number of column names specified by `CREATE VIEW`.\n\nFor example, given Table `t1` only has 3 columns\n\n``` SQL\ncreate view v1(col2, col4, col3, col5) as select * from t1\n```\n\nCurrently, Spark SQL reports the following error:\n\n```\nrequirement failed\njava.lang.IllegalArgumentException: requirement failed\n    at scala.Predef$.require(Predef.scala:212)\n    at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.command.CreateViewCommand.run(views.scala:90)\n```\n\nThis error message is very confusing. This PR is to detect the error and issue a meaningful error message.\n#### How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nVectorization parquet reader now doesn't support complex types such as ArrayType, MapType and StructType. We should support it to extend the coverage of performance improvement introduced by vectorization parquet reader. This patch is to add ArrayType and StructType first.\n### Main changes\n- Obtain repetition and definition level values during converting Parquet schema\n  \n  We convert Parquet schema to Catalyst DataType in `ParquetSchemaConverter`. Because we need repetition and definition level information during constructing complex types back from Parquet data, this PR obtains the repetition and definition levels for complex types and attaches them to Catalyst `ArrayType`, `MapType` and `StructType`. Accordingly, this PR adds a metadata to these Calalyst DataTypes as a new attribute. Although this PR tries to avoid modifying these Catalyst DataTypes, however, because the column vector in vectorization is corresponding to Catalyst DataType instead of Parquet schema, we can't access the repetition and definition levels for each column if we don't attach them to their assigned DataType.\n- Attach `VectorizedColumnReader`  to `ColumnVector`\n  \n  Because in flat schema each `ColumnVector` is actually a data column, previously the relation between `VectorizedColumnReader` and `ColumnVector` is one-by-one. Now only the `ColumnVector` representing a data column will have corresponding `VectorizedColumnReader`. Then when it is time to read batch, the `ColumnVector` with complex type will delegate to its child `ColumnVector`.\n- Implement constructing complex records in `VectorizedColumnReader`\n  \n  The `readBatch` in `VectorizedColumnReader` is the main method to read data into `ColumnVector`. Previously its behavior is simply to load required number of data according to the data type of the column vector. Now after the data is loaded into the column, we need to construct complex records in its parent column that could be an ArrayType, MapType or StructType. The way to restore the data as complex types is encoding in repetition and definition levels in Parquet. The new method `constructComplexRecords` in `VectorizedColumnReader` implements the logic to restore the complex data. Basically, what `constructComplexRecords` does is to count the continuous values and add array into the parent column if the repetition level value indicates a new record happens. Besides, `constructComplexRecords` also needs to consider the null values. Null values could mean a null record at root level, an empty array or struct. This method considers different cases and sets it correctly.\n### Benchmark\n\n```\nval N = 10000\nwithParquetTable((0 until N).map { i =>\n  ((i to i + 1000).toList, (i to i +

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently, there are a few reports about Spark 2.0 query performance regression for large queries.\n\nThis PR speeds up SQL query processing performance by removing redundant **consecutive `executePlan`** call in `Dataset.ofRows` function and `Dataset` instantiation. Specifically, this PR aims to reduce the overhead of SQL query execution plan generation, not real query execution. So, we can not see the result in the Spark Web UI. Please use the following query script. The result is **25.78 sec** -> **12.36 sec** as expected.\n\n**Sample Query**\n\n``` scala\nval n = 4000\nval values = (1 to n).map(_.toString).mkString(\", \")\nval columns = (1 to n).map(\"column\" + _).mkString(\", \")\nval query =\n  s\"\"\"\n     |SELECT $columns\n     |FROM VALUES ($values) T($columns)\n     |WHERE 1=2 AND 1 IN ($columns)\n     |GROUP BY $columns\n     |ORDER BY $columns\n     |\"\"\".stripMargin\n\ndef time[R](block: => R): R = {\n  val t0 = System.nanoTime()\n  val result = block\n  println(\"Elapsed time: \" + ((System.nanoTime - t0) / 1e9) + \"s\")\n  result\n}\n```\n\n**Before**\n\n``` scala\nscala> time(sql(query))\nElapsed time: 30.138142577s  // First query has a little overhead of initialization.\nres0: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [column1: int, column2: int ... 3998 more fields]\nscala> time(sql(query))\nElapsed time: 25.787751452s  // Let's compare this one.\nres1: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [column1: int, column2: int ... 3998 more fields]\n```\n\n**After**\n\n``` scala\nscala> time(sql(query))\nElapsed time: 17.500279659s  // First query has a little overhead of initialization.\nres0: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [column1: int, column2: int ... 3998 more fields]\nscala> time(sql(query))\nElapsed time: 12.364812255s  // This shows the real difference. The speed up is about 2 times.\nres1: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [column1: int, column2: int ... 3998 more fields]\n```\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nManual by the above

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nStar expansion over a table containing zero column does not work since 1.6. However, it works in Spark 1.5.1. This PR is to fix the issue in the master branch.\n\nFor example, \n\n``` scala\nval rddNoCols = sqlContext.sparkContext.parallelize(1 to 10).map(_ => Row.empty)\nval dfNoCols = sqlContext.createDataFrame(rddNoCols, StructType(Seq.empty))\ndfNoCols.registerTempTable(\"temp_table_no_cols\")\nsqlContext.sql(\"select * from temp_table_no_cols\").show\n```\n\nWithout the fix, users will get the following the exception:\n\n```\njava.lang.IllegalArgumentException: requirement failed\n        at scala.Predef$.require(Predef.scala:221)\n        at

`testImplicits` to `MLlibTestSparkContext` so that some implicits such as `toDF()` can be sued across ml tests.\n\nThis PR also changes all the usages of `spark.createDataFrame( ... )` to `toDF()`

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\n**Issue 1:** When a query containing LIMIT/TABLESAMPLE 0, the statistics could be zero. Results are correct but it could cause a huge performance regression. For example,\n\n``` Scala\nSeq((\"one\", 1), (\"two\", 2), (\"three\", 3), (\"four\", 4)).toDF(\"k\", \"v\")\n  .createOrReplaceTempView(\"test\")\nval df1 = spark.table(\"test\")\nval df2 = spark.table(\"test\").limit(0)\nval df = df1.join(df2, Seq(\"k\"), \"left\")\n```\n\nThe statistics of both `df` and `df2` are zero. The statistics values should never be zero; otherwise `sizeInBytes` of `BinaryNode` will also be zero (product of children). This PR is to increase it to `1` when the num of rows is equal to 0.\n\n**Issue 2:** When a query containing negative LIMIT/TABLESAMPLE, we should issue exceptions. Negative values could break the implementation assumption of multiple parts. For example, statistics calculation.  Below is the example query.\n\n``` SQL\nSELECT * FROM testData TABLESAMPLE (-1 rows)\nSELECT * FROM testData LIMIT -1\n```\n\nThis PR is to issue an appropriate exception in this case.\n\n**Issue 3:** Spark SQL follows the restriction of LIMIT clause in Hive. The argument to the LIMIT clause must evaluate to a constant value. It can be a numeric literal, or another kind of numeric expression involving operators, casts, and function return values. You cannot refer to a column or use a subquery. Currently, we do not detect whether the expression in LIMIT clause is foldable or not. If non-foldable, we might issue a strange error message. For example, \n\n``` SQL\nSELECT * FROM testData LIMIT rand() > 0.2\n```\n\nThen, a misleading error message is issued, like\n\n```\nassertion failed: No plan for GlobalLimit (_nondeterministic#203 > 0.2)\n+- Project [key#11, value#12, rand(-1441968339187861415) AS _nondeterministic#203]\n   +- LocalLimit (_nondeterministic#202 > 0.2)\n      +- Project [key#11, value#12, rand(-1308350387169017676) AS _nondeterministic#202]\n         +- LogicalRDD [key#11, value#12]\n\njava.lang.AssertionError: assertion failed: No plan for GlobalLimit (_nondeterministic#203 > 0.2)\n+- Project [key#11, value#12, rand(-1441968339187861415) AS _nondeterministic#203]\n   +- LocalLimit (_nondeterministic#202 > 0.2)\n      +- Project [key#11, value#12, rand(-1308350387169017676) AS _nondeterministic#202]\n         +- LogicalRDD [key#11, value#12]\n```\n\nThis PR detects it and then issues a meaningful error message. \n#### How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded test cases.\n","created_at":"2016-07-03T06:05:19Z","updated_at":"2016-07-11T08:25:22Z","closed_at":"2016-07-11T08:24:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3c6eeb49a1ebaa06e431b4b7359456c723d007a1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14034/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14034/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14034/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d66870bb274a206f16d33f56214246b17953a90e","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:limit","ref":"limit","sha":"d66870bb274a206f16d33f56214246b17953a90e","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThere are cases where `complete` output mode does not output updated aggregated value; for details please refer to [SPARK-16350](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-16350).\n\nThe cause is that, as we do `data.as[T].foreachPartition { iter => ... }` in `ForeachSink.addBatch()`, `foreachPartition()` does not support incremental planning for now.\n\nThis patches makes `foreachPartition()` support incremental planning in `ForeachSink`, by making a special version of `Dataset` with its `rdd()` method supporting incremental planning.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded a unit test which failed before the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently, `JacksonGenerator.apply` is doing type-based dispatch for each row to write appropriate values.\nIt might not have to be done like this because the schema is already kept.\n\nSo, appropriate writers can be created first according to the schema once, and then apply them to each row. This approach is similar with `CatalystWriteSupport`.\n\nThis PR corrects `JacksonGenerator` so that it creates all writers for the schema once and then applies them to each row rather than type dispatching for every row.\n\nBenchmark was proceeded with the codes below:\n\n``` scala\ntest(\"Benchmark for JSON writer\") {\n  val N = 500 << 8\n  val row =\n    \"\"\"{\"struct\":{\"field1\": true, \"field2\": 92233720368547758070},\n      \"structWithArrayFields\":{\"field1\":[4, 5, 6], \"field2\":[\"str1\", \"str2\"]},\n      \"arrayOfString\":[\"str1\", \"str2\"],\n

produced the results below\n- **Before**\n\n```\nJSON writer:                             Best/Avg Time(ms)    Rate(M/s)   Per Row(ns)
