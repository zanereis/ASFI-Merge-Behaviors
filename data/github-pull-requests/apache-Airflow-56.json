PR is a proposal to fix/resolve the request for feature as described in #37810 as a thin approach.\r\n\r\nIdea for this solution:\r\n\r\n- Allow using task result as dynamic `extra`\r\n  - If dataset

CI scripts change we want to run full set of tests to make sure that the new scripts are working fine. But we do not necessarily want to run all matrix combos of Python/Kubernetes and DB tests - it's enough to run ALL tests but with default versions.\r\n\r\nThis PR implements that. It separates \"full tests needed\" output from \"all versions\" output. The first one set to \"true\" will make the CI run all kinds of tests but only the presences of \"all versions\" = \"true\" will run all combinations of versions to be used, otherwise just \"default\" versions will be used.\r\n\r\nThe \"all version\" output will be automatically triggered when:\r\n\r\n* direct push (AKA \"canary\") or \"schedule\" build is run in the airflow repo\r\n* \"all versions\" label is set on the PR\r\n* build dependencies changed in the build in pyproject.toml\r\n* project dependencies changed in the build in pyproject.toml or when generated_provider_dependencies.json changed.\r\n\r\nThose conditions are important enought to trigger a build with all versions changed. We still have the \"canary\" build always running all version checks - so that it will catch any potential issues that regular PRs to \"scripts\"/\"workflows\" might cause and the contributor might still add \"all versions\" label in the PR if unsure.\r\n\r\nContributor might also add \"default versions only\" label on a PR to force the build to only use default versions even if dependencies change in the PR.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

This PR:\n- Removes the AutoML operators (+related tests/docs)\n- Removes the dependency 'google-cloud-automl'\n- Deprecates `CloudAutoMLHook`\n- Deprecates AutoML links.\n\nThe hook and the links haven't been formally deprecated in Airflow, so it might be better to take a bit more cautious approach before removing both, as theoretically someone could import them into their codebase without knowing that they are deprecated.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

order to reduce code duplication and high complexity of the implementation, GKE hooks were refactored in this PR:\r\n1. Existing `GKEHook` and `GKEAsyncHook` provide interface to GKE API remain unchanged.\r\n2. The new `GKEKubernetesHook(GoogleBaseHook, KubernetesHook)` was introduced as a replacement for redundant hooks that used to contain duplicated methods that now are simply inherited from `GoogleBaseHook` and `KubernetesHook`:\r\n- GKEDeploymentHook (deprecated)\r\n- GKECustomResourceHook (deprecated)\r\n- GKEPodHook (deprecated)\r\n- GKEJobHook (deprecated)\r\n3. By following the same pattern, the new `GKEKubernetesAsyncHook(GoogleBaseAsyncHook, AsyncKubernetesHook)` was introduced as a replacement for redundant hooks that used to contain duplicated methods that now are simply inherited from `GoogleBaseAsyncHook` and `AsyncKubernetesHook`:\r\n- GKEPodAsyncHook (deprecated)\r\n4. New hooks (GKEKubernetesHook, GKEKubernetesAsyncHook) provide access to the standard Kubernetes API with a GKE authentication.\r\n5. Slightly adjusted system tests (they are all green now).\r\n![system tests](https://github.com/VladaZakharova/airflow/assets/42827971/bf8807a8-43f5-4792-b8bd-8050df722984)\r\n6. Except tiny changes, unit tests remain the same in order to prove stability of the code after refactoring. In the following PR we will disconnect GKE operators from the deprecated hooks, so it will be easy to remove them in the future.","created_at":"2024-03-22T11:52:12Z","updated_at":"2024-03-25T10:19:23Z","closed_at":"2024-03-25T10:19:23Z","merged_at":"2024-03-25T10:19:23Z","merge_commit_sha":"32ed83bd0ef4694668bf74f3afbfaa0f5afa2768","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"jedcunningham","id":66968678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2OTY4Njc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66968678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham","html_url":"https://github.com/jedcunningham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"hussein-awala","id":21311487,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzExNDg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21311487?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala","html_url":"https://github.com/hussein-awala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1463392518,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDYzMzkyNTE4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:google","name":"provider:google","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"Google

order to reduce code duplication and high complexity of the implementation, GKE hooks were refactored in this PR:\r\n1. Existing `GKEHook` and `GKEAsyncHook` provide interface to GKE API remain unchanged.\r\n2. The new `GKEKubernetesHook(GoogleBaseHook, KubernetesHook)` was introduced as a replacement for redundant hooks that used to contain duplicated methods that now are simply inherited from `GoogleBaseHook` and `KubernetesHook`:\r\n- GKEDeploymentHook (deprecated)\r\n- GKECustomResourceHook (deprecated)\r\n- GKEPodHook (deprecated)\r\n- GKEJobHook (deprecated)\r\n3. By following the same pattern, the new `GKEKubernetesAsyncHook(GoogleBaseAsyncHook, AsyncKubernetesHook)` was introduced as a replacement for redundant hooks that used to contain duplicated methods that now are simply inherited from `GoogleBaseAsyncHook` and `AsyncKubernetesHook`:\r\n- GKEPodAsyncHook (deprecated)\r\n4. New hooks (GKEKubernetesHook, GKEKubernetesAsyncHook) provide access to the standard Kubernetes API with a GKE authentication.\r\n5. Slightly adjusted system tests (they are all green now).\r\n![system tests](https://github.com/VladaZakharova/airflow/assets/42827971/bf8807a8-43f5-4792-b8bd-8050df722984)\r\n6. Except tiny changes, unit tests remain the same in order to prove stability of the code after refactoring. In the following PR we will disconnect GKE operators from the deprecated hooks, so it will be easy to remove them in the

#31168.\r\n\r\nPR to update the azure-service version to 7.12.1. The new version is using an all python based AMQP stack, which means uamqp is no longer required and opens up the library overall to be run in a wide variety of architectures, OSes etc. There are some performance improvements when receiving messages from queues & topics. It also includes important bug fixes, including for correct behavior on connection drops, more accurate logging, to address misc. errors/warnings, large message sending/settling.\r\n\r\nWe saw that you hadn't updated the version in a while and this version will help with an old issue that was seen here, so wanted to bump!\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nRead the **[Pull

This feature aids in understanding which DAGs are producing or consuming a specific dataset.\r\n\r\n**Changes:**\r\n- Implemented `GET /dataset_dags/{dataset_id}` in the webserver.\r\n- Added tests covering different scenarios for the endpoint.\r\n\r\n**Example API Response:**\r\n```json\r\n[\r\n  {\r\n    \"dag_id\": \"conditional_dataset_and_time_based_timetable\",\r\n    \"is_paused\": false\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    \"dag_id\": \"consume_1_and_2_with_dataset_expressions\",\r\n    \"is_paused\": false\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    \"dag_id\": \"consume_1_or_2_with_dataset_expressions\",\r\n

This might help to detect some minor/major incompatabilities\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

you rmeove a dependency from pyproject.toml, until your PR gets merged, it is still present in the main branch of Airflow and this is where we do a \"warm\" cache install of dependencies when we build the CI image. So the dependency is stil there when your PR is running tests. In order to remove the dependency for the time of PR, we need to remove it manually in the script that installs dependencies from branch tip (and also changing this script will trigger Docker cache invalidation of the branch tip installation step).\r\n\r\nThis PR adds ability to specify the package you remove to also be removed after \"branch tip\" installation. After merging your PR, it should be fine to remove it again from the branch tip.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.
