Please make sure the target branch is right. In most case, the target branch should be `develop`. -->\r\n\r\n### Which Issue(s) This PR Fixes\r\n\r\nAdd cache for each client request broker end rebalancing in the pop consumption mode to avoid wasting computing resources of broker end due to repeated calculation of load balancing without changes. The effect is more obvious in theory when there are a large number of queues or consumers\r\n<!-- Please ensure that the related issue has already been created, and [link this pull request to that issue using keywords](<https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword>) to ensure automatic closure. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #9123\r\n\r\n### Brief Description\r\nTo add caching for broker-end rebalancing under the pop consumption model, use ReentrantLock to maintain consistency and efficiency. Before performing load balancing calculations, attempt to obtain cache entries when the client list and messagequeue list remain unchanged. Only if the cache is not hit will the calculation logic be executed, using minimal space to avoid wasting broker computing resources and ensuring efficient rebalancing requests\r\n\r\n<!-- Write a brief description for your pull request to help the maintainer understand the reasons behind your changes. -->\r\n\r\n### How Did You Test This Change?\r\n\r\nTen consumers were registered for the test consumer group, and mock 15 queues were set up to test the correctness and performance of the broker-end doLoadBalance method under the test pop consumption mode. All QueryAssignmentProcessorTest (including the original 5 methods) passed, and the performance is as follows (in the local environment)\r\n\r\n![32a8f585dfbee87e9d7e2cbdb32317a](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3feb92b-fc5e-4912-95d9-bdc3d0afa447)\r\n\r\n![d6e52c5a9e21da12f5038f1b1c14df1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c3e33f5-d637-4762-b434-ec20d7f015da)\r\n\r\n![c446c0d2f326bc8a11a36836447db2d](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/93dd78f8-a127-4bfb-ab49-d72a46a2f6e8)\r\n\r\n<!--

Which Issue(s) This PR Fixes\r\nfixes #9064 \r\n\r\n### Brief Description\r\n事务消息， 回查判断RMQ_SYS_TRANS_HALF_TOPIC消息是否在RMQ_SYS_TRANS_OP_HALF_TOPIC 中，优化判断方式。之前代码是先判断Map.containsKey，然后进行removeKey，新的方式是直接removeKey ！= null。之前如果Map.containsKey为真，还需要进行额外的一步removeKey操作，新的方式removeKey！= null，即判断了Map是否存在key，又移出了对应的key，提升了一点点性能。\r\n﻿\r\nTransactional messages: The process involves checking whether messages in RMQ_SYS_TRANS_HALF_TOPIC exist in RMQ_SYS_TRANS_OP_HALF_TOPIC, with an optimized approach for verification. Previously, the code first used Map.containsKey to check existence and then performed removeKey. The new approach directly uses removeKey != null.\r\n\r\nIn the previous method, if Map.containsKey returned true, an additional removeKey operation was required. In contrast, the new approach both checks if the key exists in the Map and removes the corresponding key in one step, offering a slight performance improvement.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Did You Test This Change?\r\n经过多轮测试，在Map.containsKey 为true为false概率各为50%的情况，第二种方案明显优于第一种方案。而实际生产环境中，事务回查状态为Unknown的场景应该小于50%，在高并发大数据量场景下，个人认为这个小改动对性能还是有一些提升。\r\n\r\nAfter multiple rounds of testing, when the probabilities of Map.containsKey being true or false are both 50%, the second approach consistently outperforms the first. In actual production environments, the probability of transactional checks being in an “Unknown” state should be less than 50%. Therefore, I believe this small adjustment provides a minor but meaningful performance improvement.\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/28deccb5-c0da-4814-89fc-59a0afcf9657)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-12-18T04:34:55Z","updated_at":"2025-01-08T09:25:05Z","closed_at":"2025-01-08T09:25:05Z","merged_at":"2025-01-08T09:25:05Z","merge_commit_sha":"a343021229673bdb4935442e23664b99306a874d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/9062/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/9062/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/9062/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/statuses/f13c93e8dae7605c056d4dbaac3d0d605dfe0199","head":{"label":"LilMosey:tangjie/transmsg_optimize","ref":"tangjie/transmsg_optimize","sha":"f13c93e8dae7605c056d4dbaac3d0d605dfe0199","user":{"login":"LilMosey","id":51823604,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxODIzNjA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51823604?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LilMosey","html_url":"https://github.com/LilMosey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LilMosey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LilMosey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LilMosey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LilMosey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LilMosey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LilMosey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LilMosey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LilMosey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LilMosey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":905044237,"node_id":"R_kgDONfHhDQ","name":"rocketmq","full_name":"LilMosey/rocketmq","private":false,"owner":{"login":"LilMosey","id":51823604,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxODIzNjA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51823604?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LilMosey","html_url":"https://github.com/LilMosey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LilMosey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LilMosey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LilMosey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LilMosey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LilMosey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LilMosey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LilMosey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LilMosey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LilMosey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/LilMosey/rocketmq","description":"Apache

The `createTimerMessageStore` method's parameters were updated previously, but a later PR did not rebase to the latest code, leading to mismatched method calls.

These consumers each have their own independent thread pool, causing the JVM to create tens of thousands of threads, seriously affecting performance.\r\nTherefore, I have an idea. Can we allow different consumers to reuse the thread pool for this scenario, reduce system resource consumption and improve performance?\r\n\r\n### Brief Description\r\n\r\n<!-- Write a brief

To address this, #8856 @Lizhanhui developed v2 to enable storing lmq consumer offsets in RocksDB. However, upgrading from v1 to v2 with backward compatibility is not feasible. Therefore, it's crucial to introduce support for persisting lmq consumer offsets in v1.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Brief Description\r\n\r\n<!-- Write a brief description for your pull request to help the maintainer understand the reasons behind your changes. -->\r\n\r\nTo streamline the implementation, we will not use a separate class for lmq consumer offset storage. Instead, we will leverage the existing RocksDBConsumerOffsetManager. Under the v1 metadata configuration, this manager will handle both lmq and non-lmq consumer offsets collectively.\r\n\r\n### How Did You Test This Change?\r\n\r\n<!-- In order to ensure the code quality of Apache RocketMQ, we expect every pull request to have undergone thorough testing.
