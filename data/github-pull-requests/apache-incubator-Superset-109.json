SUMMARY\r\nUpdate Celery default configuration and docs to use the [new style configuration settings](https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/4.4.2/userguide/configuration.html#new-lowercase-settings).\r\n\r\nThis change is mainly to prepare for future Celery upgrades, as support for the old style config settings [will be removed in the next major version](https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/stable/userguide/configuration.html#new-lowercase-settings) (6.0).\r\n\r\nOther (potentially) functional changes:\r\n- Removing the long-deprecated `CELERYD_LOG_LEVEL` default setting. Logging should be configured using [these settings](https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/4.4.2/userguide/configuration.html#logging).\r\n- Remove `CELERY_TASK_PROTOCOL = 1` in the Docker config as the default protocol (2) has been the default since 4.0 and is supported by versions 3.1.24 and 4.x+.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nEnsure correct Celery operation using the new settings.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Requires DB Migration.\r\n- [ ] Confirm DB Migration upgrade and downgrade tested.\r\n- [ ] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or API\r\n","created_at":"2021-01-15T20:47:57Z","updated_at":"2022-06-16T11:53:05Z","closed_at":"2021-06-26T03:07:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c9ef4e5572e32a94b11ac6755dafdac8c785e292","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"craig-rueda","id":2595291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1OTUyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2595291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda","html_url":"https://github.com/craig-rueda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":238899554,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMzg4OTk1NTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/inactive","name":"inactive","color":"14351C","default":false,"description":"Inactive

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nResults with 50+ (`MAX_COLUMNS_FOR_TABLE`) columns in SQL Lab are currently broken. The `<FilterableTable>` component has two different render options, one for <50 columns and another for 50+. Recently (?), the component was styled, but the styling was applied only to the <50 columns render method.\r\n\r\nI fixed it by wrapping the grid element (`<SyncScroll>`) in `<StyledFilterableTable>` as well.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot_2021-01-15

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nFix two bugs in Box Plot Viz:\r\n\r\n1.  when select \"Series\" and \"Distributed by\", `SqalTable` generates invalid SQL queries\r\n

#12091 .\r\n\r\nAnyway, the related logics in the new chart data API were not robust enough. Both issues were actually fixed in #10270 as well, but I'm creating a separate PR here to fix BoxPlot first.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nSee summary for BEFORE.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\nManual verification.\r\n\r\n1. Go to Box Plot\r\n2. Select both \"Series\" and \"Distributed By\"\r\n3. To test Bug 2, make sure to use an adhoc metric\r\n\r\nThis is a hotfix. I'm going to create a separate task to add tests.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nBefore #12147 and #12091, FilterBox is considered a timeseries viz, and has a Time section where users can set time granularity and time filter. This adds it back so people can still use Time filter on FilterBox and the existing charts that do use it don't break.\r\n\r\nIn the future, we should probably bring the TimeFilter to regular AdhocFilter, as long as a column is temporal. This way we convert FilterBox into a non-timeseries viz. But since we are investing in native filters, this is probably not necessary anyway.\r\n\r\n(cc @zhaoyongjie @junlincc )\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n####

SUMMARY\r\nFixing the bug that time granularity doesn't work for WEEKS/MONTHS/QUARTERS/YEARS.\r\nPinot internally has two time converter functions: timeConverter and dateTrunc.\r\nPinot `timeConverter` has better performance comparing to `dateTrunc` function when querying for granularity `DAYS`/`MINUTES`/`SECONDS`/... as it uses arithmetic ops for it, however, this function doesn't support conversion to `WEEKS`/`MONTHS`/`QUARTERS`/`YEARS`.\r\n\r\nSo we need to use `dateTrunc` for querying with those granularities.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore:

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nCurrently Time Table is broken because recent updates on the Time Column control  ( https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui/pull/869 ) didn't apply to the actual Time Table plugin code used in `superset-frontend`.\r\n\r\nThis is because Time Table vis hasn't been fully migrated to `superset-ui`. This PR ports the necessary change to the control panel to `superset-frontend`. Tried to do the full migration, but the viz is broken in a separate way. Obviously the migrated plugin `@superset-ui/legacy-plugin-chart-time-table` doesn't really work.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n####

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nFixes #12480 \r\n\r\n1. Always use datasource uid (or `parameter`, or `key`, whatever you call it) from the `slice.datasource_id` and `slice.datasource_type`, instead of the `datasource` field stored in `form_data` (`slice.params`), as they can be out of sync.\r\n2. Update the import scripts to account for this and update `datasource` in `slice.params` with real dataset id associated with uuid.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n####

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nIn order to fix the random scrollbars on dashboard charts, I added a flex layout to the `.chart-slice` div. This seems to remove some \"phantom\" spacing between the chart header and the chart body that was causing the overflow. From what I can tell this leaves scrollbars where we need them, e.g. the short filter box in the screenshot below.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not

Go to SQL Lab and run a query with results\r\n2. Switch to another tab\r\n3. Switch back\r\n4.

SUMMARY\r\nThe option `menuPortalTarget` of the react-select component was introduced in order for the dropdowns to show fully when overlaying certain container elements. However, setting the `menuPortalTarget` to `document.body` (as originally the multi-choice dropdown did and later the single-choice) comes with several issues, such as the click events being targeted outside of the container elements, that ultimately caused this issue #12388.\r\n\r\nThis PR removes the `menuPortalTarget` for both single-choice and multi-choice dropdowns. In addition to that, this introduces the optional ability to force the overflow visibility of the dropdowns for cases where setting the `overflow` `visible` isn't viable on the container element (see for instance issue #12004 )\r\n\r\nIt also adjusts some excessive z-index by setting it high enough to give it precedence over the Antd Popover and other components.\r\n\r\nCloses #12388 \r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60598000/104368923-06b6fc00-551d-11eb-935b-b6b7ba657dc3.mp4\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60598000/104368799-dc653e80-551c-11eb-9778-3fed7cede574.mp4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n1. Open the single and multi-choice dropdowns throughout the project\r\n2.

SUMMARY\r\nIn Explore view, right now we have chart section and data table. Chart and results table are from different API response, but they actually are generated from same query and same data frame.\r\n\r\nIn airbnb Presto resources are limited. If query engine detects a same user running the same query in the multiple requests, query engine will drop one of the duplicated queries. This rule might impact the explore view user: when chart is loading, if user open data table, Explore will send another request to query engine, which is actually the same query. As the result, one of query request will be dropped and error returned.\r\n\r\nThis PR will try to fix this issue by delaying the results table request:\r\n- When chart is still loading, if user clicks on data, Explore will show a spinner, but won't trigger new request\r\n- When chart is done loading and results panel is open, Explore will trigger 2nd request (with `results=true` parameter). At this moment, query's results data is cached, so the 2nd request won't reach query engine, and return cached results data to frontend. \r\n\r\nEven this issue probably only happens in airbnb not other companies, it is a good practice that should never send duplicated queries to engine. And since the deferred request always have cached results, it should only take ~1 second for roundtrip.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n**Before**: when user open results table while chart loading, Explore view sends 2 queries at the same time:\r\n![7Jek16ZC1K](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27990562/104144720-447b1f80-5379-11eb-845a-30ad6621b762.gif)\r\n\r\n**After**: when user open results table while chart loading, Explore view will show spinner but not sending another request. But once the chart request is completed, data request will be triggered:\r\n![dbxXDoH8Ox](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27990562/104149435-f707ae00-538a-11eb-8482-5dd41a110c33.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n1. open explore view with a slow query\r\n2. when chart is loading, open data table, just see results tab\r\n3. check browser console, check how many requests running at the same time\r\n\r\n\r\ncc @ktmud @zuzana-vej @junlincc
