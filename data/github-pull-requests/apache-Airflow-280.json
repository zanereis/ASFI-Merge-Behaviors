sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2973\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nI remember Fokko and Joy had tested Airflow on Python 3.6. Also, DigitalOcean has also been using Airflow with 3.6 as mentioned in the mailing list: https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/4b3ab976ad268f3da96c5317290d11120c26c7e0f92886eef5b8b50f@%3Cdev.airflow.apache.org%3E\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1998\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n  - Added a new Databrick's operator, DatabricksRunNowOperator, for the API's jobs/run-now functionality.\r\n  - After consulting Databricks on their preference, pulled shared code out of DatabricksSubmitRunOperator into module level functions that both the DatabricksSubmitRunOperator & DatabricksRunNowOperator call.\r\n  - Added required API call to databricks_hook.py\r\n  - Added/updated tests for both databricks_operators.py and the databricks_hook.py\r\n  - Fixed a connection state issue with tokens in the setUp part of the operator tests where conn.extras wasn't getting reset between test runs and maintaining its mock token.\r\n  - Fixed some existing indentation for flake8\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests:\r\n\r\n- I mirrored the same tests that the existing DatabricksSubmitRunOperator had for the new DatabricksRunNowOperator.\r\n\r\n  - **Added**:\r\ntests/contrib/operators/test_databricks_operator.py\r\n\t* DatabricksOperatorSharedFunctions\r\n\t\t* test_deep_string_coerce\r\n\t* DatabricksRunNowOperatorTest\r\n\t\t* test_init_with_named_parameters\r\n\t\t* test_init_with_json\r\n\t\t* test_init_with_merging\r\n\t\t* test_init_with_templating\r\n\t\t* test_init_with_bad_type\r\n\t\t* test_exec_success\r\n\t\t* test_exec_failure\r\n\t\t* test_on_kill\r\n  - **Updated**:\r\ntests/contrib/operators/test_databricks_operator.py\r\n\t* DatabricksSubmitRunOperatorTest\r\n\t\t* test_init_with_named_parameters\r\n\t\t* test_init_with_json\r\n\t\t* test_init_with_merging\r\n\t\t* test_init_with_templating\r\n\t\t* test_init_with_bad_type\r\n\t\t* test_exec_success\r\n\t\t* test_exec_failure\r\n\t\t* test_on_kill\r\n  - **Removed**:\r\ntests/contrib/operators/test_databricks_operator.py\r\n\t* DatabricksSubmitRunOperatorTest\r\n\t\t* test_deep_string_coerce (it was moved to its own external test class)\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

I am using zendesk_hook.py file in incubator-airflow/airflow/hooks, I am getting an error: \"KeyError: 'search'\" - the error is due to line 81 in the zendesk_hook file \"results ={key: results[key] for key in keys}\"\r\n\r\nI believe the line needs an extra tab at line 81, because this line is running regardless if sideloading is set to true. I believe it should only run when sideloading is set to true. \r\n\r\n**Tests:**\r\nMy code runs once the tab has been added.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2959\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThe `HTTPSensor` is supposed to sense if a resource/endpoint if available at a location specified by http connection. It will return `False` when the HTTP Status code is 404 or check function returns `False`.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, HTTP Error code OTHER THAN 404, or Connection Refused Error, would fail the sensor itself directly (**no more poking**) https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/blob/f6191fbd7a61766bd002873db371b74702b13ff3/airflow/sensors/http_sensor.py#L90\r\nThis is not clear enough in the doc. Users like myself may think these situations will also return False and try poking later, while it's not true.\r\n\r\nThis should be made clear in the documentation.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nOnly comment is changed. No change is made on the executable codes.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-26T08:45:37Z","updated_at":"2018-08-27T09:08:35Z","closed_at":"2018-08-27T09:04:36Z","merged_at":"2018-08-27T09:04:36Z","merge_commit_sha":"6afd38d79b2439ca5e3bb349c5d2007ad09aa27f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3809/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3809/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3809/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/d0f7fb6de8e5cc3325dca6d727c5ef4178c544f8","head":{"label":"XD-DENG:refine_httpsensor_doc","ref":"refine_httpsensor_doc","sha":"d0f7fb6de8e5cc3325dca6d727c5ef4178c544f8","user":{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":142260154,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDIyNjAxNTQ=","name":"airflow","full_name":"XD-DENG/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG/airflow","description":"Apache

Jira\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2062\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n   - For an in-depth explanation of these changes, please see this [design doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qaucGw52aoR96swHQqIYN9nQXn2QKSOWvw6-KyI6Wwc/edit?usp=sharing).\r\n   - Connections can now be encrypted using a local key that is encrypted using a KMS before being stored, instead of the global fernet key. Enabling this behavior requires creating a connection through the CLI (web UI in a coming PR) with the new KMS fields specified.\r\n   - `Connection` and `BaseHook` were also refactored to support loading connections from the `Connection` class (instead of `BaseHook`).\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests:\r\n   - `tests/contrib/hooks/test_gcp_kms_hook.py`\r\n      - `test_encrypt_conn`\r\n      - `test_encrypt_conn`\r\n   - `tests/models.py`\r\n      - `FernetTest`\r\n      - `test_connection_kms_encryption`\r\n      - `test_connection_from_uri_kms_encryption`\r\n      - `test_get_kms_hook_missing`\r\n      - `test_update_kms`\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1.

The `end_date` only exists when user try to mark a dag as success or failed from UI. This PR change the `DagRun.set_state()` function to set `end_date` when a `DagRun` state is changed and redirect existing dag_run state assignment to `set_state` function. It also fix UI to make sure a cleared dag will reset `end_date` to NULL.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\ntests/models.py:DagRunTest.test_dagrun_set_state_end_date\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\nDocumented in config code comments\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u --

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2948\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThere may be different combinations of arguments, and some processings are being done 'silently', while users may not be fully aware of them.\r\n\r\nFor example\r\n- User only needs to provide either `ssh_hook` or `ssh_conn_id`, while this is not clear in doc\r\n- if both provided, `ssh_conn_id` will be ignored.\r\n- if `remote_host` is provided, it will replace the `remote_host` which wasndefined in `ssh_hook` or predefined in the connection of `ssh_conn_id`\r\n\r\nThese should be documented clearly to ensure it's transparent to the users.\r\n\r\nlog.info() should also be used to remind users and provide clear logs.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-23T15:00:59Z","updated_at":"2018-08-29T23:47:22Z","closed_at":"2018-08-29T19:20:12Z","merged_at":"2018-08-29T19:20:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"0b0f4ac3caca72e67273f9e80221677d78ad5c0e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3793/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3793/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3793/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/8ec75b721c2851acd4d84d585e7ac03546b25b1e","head":{"label":"XD-DENG:check_arg_combination_for_ssh_operators","ref":"check_arg_combination_for_ssh_operators","sha":"8ec75b721c2851acd4d84d585e7ac03546b25b1e","user":{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":142260154,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDIyNjAxNTQ=","name":"airflow","full_name":"XD-DENG/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG/airflow","description":"Apache

issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2930\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n-Fixing issue caused by https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/3740\r\n\r\n-`execute_command.apply_async(args = command, queue = queue)` will pass a list of arguments rather than one to function `execute_command()` which is defined as taking only one argument. The test in `test_celery_executor.py` right now only have one item in the testing command list and can not cover this case.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests:\r\n>Update tests/executors/test_celery_executor.py to cover multiple parameters.\r\n>Update tests/executors/dask_executor.py to cover multiple parameters.\r\n>Update tests/executors/test_local_executor.py to cover multiple parameters.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n@bolkedebruin \r\n@feng-tao \r\n@yrqls21

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2921 https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2922\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n### `Potential bug-1`\r\nIf a task state becomes either `SUCCESS` or `FAILURE` or `REVOKED`, it will be removed from `self.tasks` and `self.last_state`. However, because line 108 is not indented properly, this task will be added back to `self.last_state` again.\r\n\r\nThis will not lead to any error. But may still be worth changing.\r\n\r\n**Solution**: indent line 108.\r\n\r\n### `Potential bug-2`\r\n\r\nCelery Task states normally change in ways like “PENDING -> STARTED -> SUCCESS/FAILURE” (http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/reference/celery.states.html).\r\n\r\nIn lines 107 and 108, it’s `task.state` rather than `state`, i.e. it will reflect the latest real-time state of the Celery task. \r\n\r\nLet’s imagine: task state becomes **STARTED** first (initial state is **PENDING**), then the `if-elif-else` block will be triggered (line 93). It’s possible the Celery task state becomes **SUCCESS** when whichever line between 94-105 is running. At line 108, the latest state of the task will be changed to **SUCCESS** rather than **STARTED** in `self.last_state` because it’s referring to the latest state `task.state` rather than variable `state`.\r\n\r\nThen this task will be dead-locked because the `if-elif-else block` will never be triggered for it again. It has no chance to be ended properly with methods `self.success()` or `self.fail()`. Although the chance that this happens is quite low (the time window is very short), the chance is not zero.\r\n\r\n**Solution**: change `task.state` to `state` in lines 107 and 108.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new

lot of small issues that I've fixed to enforce Flake8 globally instead of on the diffs.\r\n- Unused imports\r\n- Wrong import order\r\n- Small identation fixes\r\n- Remove one letter variables\r\n- Fix noqa annotations\r\n\r\nThere are still a lot of violations.

In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3281\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nCurrently the implementation of git-sync is broken because:\r\n- git-sync clones the repository in /tmp and not in airflow-dags volume\r\n- git-sync add a link to point to the revision required but it is not\r\ntaken into account in AIRFLOW__CORE__DAGS_FOLDER\r\n\r\nDags/logs hostPath volume has been added (needed if airflow run in\r\nkubernetes in local environment)\r\n\r\nIn this PR I also removed `worker_dags_folder` config because IMO is redundant. In fact is possible to define it in `dags_folder` using a specific `airflow-configmap` for the workers\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nTo avoid false positive in CI `load_examples` is set to `False`\r\notherwise DAGs from `airflow/example_dags` are always loaded. In this\r\nway is possible to test `import` in DAGs.\r\n\r\nTo do so `KubernetesExecutorTest` now uses a specific folder `airflowexample_dags_kubernetes` to run test instead of `airflow/example_dags` and the DAG `example_kubernetes_annotation` imports a an external module\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2916\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n### `Background`\r\nThe `AwsHook()` and `S3`-related operators/sensors are depending on package `boto3`.\r\n\r\nIn `boto3`, when we initiate a `client` or a `resource`, argument `verify` is provided (https://boto3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/core/session.html ).\r\n\r\n### `Why do we need this`\r\nIt is useful when\r\n- users want to use a different CA cert bundle than the one used by `botocore`.\r\n- users want to have **'--no-verify-ssl'** ([link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/)), otherwise error `[SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed` may appear. **This is especially useful when we're using on-premises S3 or other implementations of object storage, like IBM's Cloud Object Storage**.\r\n\r\n### `Backward Compatibility`\r\nThe default value here is always `None`, which is also the default value in `boto3`, so that backward compatibility is ensured too.\r\n\r\n### `Others`\r\nAnother SSL related argument in `boto3`, `use_ssl`, can be ignored here because it will be ignored by `boto3` if `endpoint_url` is provided (`endpoint_url` is always provided in `AwsHook()`).\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2913\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n1. in `S3KeySensor()`, when `bucket_name` is provided, and `bucket_key` is also provided as a full S3:// url, the `full_url` obtained eventually will be wrong. It will be like \"`s3://bucket_name/s3://bucket_name/object_key`\". This should be avoided by adding checking and raise exception in such case.\r\n\r\n2. Given the documentation is not clear enough, this issue may happen to new users of S3KeySensor(). I have improved the Documentation as well.\r\n\r\n3. Unit tests are added for the `bucket_key` and `bucket_name` combination checking as well.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new

In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

Root cause\r\n\r\nReturned the encoded `bytes` type\r\nhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/base64.html#base64.b64encode\r\n\r\nHowever `attachment.content` expects a string.\r\n\r\nProblem is in this line:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/blob/9d516c7134eb22a3c2fc63cf96626ef6e8b247f2/airflow/contrib/utils/sendgrid.py#L91\r\n\r\n```\r\nattachment.content = base64.b64encode(f.read())\r\n```\r\n\r\nh4. Solution via str()\r\n\r\nBy googling the found solution was:\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/47479205/e-mail-attachment-using-sendgird\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/44933816/encode-csv-file-for-sendgrids-email-api/44934090\r\n\r\n```\r\nattachment.content = str(base64.b64encode(f.read()), 'utf-8')\r\n```\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-16T13:55:27Z","updated_at":"2018-08-20T09:41:41Z","closed_at":"2018-08-20T09:41:28Z","merged_at":"2018-08-20T09:41:28Z","merge_commit_sha":"e3ca315430c3915c22ea799009480506174c8a96","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3757/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3757/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3757/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/04584065a9483b2e309fe115179f28809b94b3fc","head":{"label":"elgalu:patch-2","ref":"patch-2","sha":"04584065a9483b2e309fe115179f28809b94b3fc","user":{"login":"elgalu","id":111569,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTU2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/111569?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elgalu","html_url":"https://github.com/elgalu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elgalu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elgalu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elgalu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elgalu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elgalu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elgalu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elgalu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elgalu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elgalu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":138689045,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzg2ODkwNDU=","name":"apache-airflow","full_name":"elgalu/apache-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"elgalu","id":111569,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTU2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/111569?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elgalu","html_url":"https://github.com/elgalu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elgalu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elgalu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elgalu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elgalu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elgalu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elgalu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elgalu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elgalu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elgalu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/elgalu/apache-airflow","description":"Apache

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2899\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nCurrently, the sensitive variable is hidden from being exposed in the Web UI. However, if the UI is compromised, someone can export variables where all the sensitive variables are exported in plain text format.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8811558/44098679-bfbf885e-9fd8-11e8-9486-864a93f2ef61.png)\r\n\r\nThis will still allow an admin to export all the variables from the CLI. The main intention here would be incase of an exposed Web UI, the sensitive data should still be inaccessible.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-14T14:44:19Z","updated_at":"2019-08-30T20:39:33Z","closed_at":"2018-12-18T14:03:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fc4c105808b47fde97ce37168ed6775aab2d39c0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2896\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n1. Make documentation clearer (format for `ignored_ext` should be extensions like 'py' rather than '.py')\r\n2. Ensure upper/lower case would not affect the usage of `ignored_ext` feagure.\r\n3. Improve test coverage by adding tests for methods `filter_for_ignored_ext()` and `filter_for_filesize()`\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new

Tests have been updated and merged in (#3710). This pull request is to fix a bug where the time variable that gets checked to see if the Druid ingestion task has exceeded max ingestion time is incorrectly updated.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nTests were updated in (#3710)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2893\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nDepending on which version of dataflow SDK is used, the jobName supplied in the gcp_dataflow_hook may or may not be the one accepted by the cloud dataflow service. As a result, the dataflow job polling will run forever as it couldn't find a matched job_id for the gvien job_name.\r\n\r\nThis fix allows the job_id to be extracted from dataflow job submission logs and used for polling job completion status.\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nAdded four new tests with successful local test run:\r\n./run_unit_tests.sh tests.contrib.hooks.test_gcp_dataflow_hook\r\nRan 13 tests in 2.244s\r\n\r\nOK\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease take this PR into consideration. It adds the ability for containers created by the `DockerOperator` to be removed automatically after execution. \r\n\r\nMake sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1368\r\n\r\nOther issues which seem to be duplicate:\r\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-516\r\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-465\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR adds back the `auto_remove` option to the `DockerOperator`, which will automatically delete the Docker container once it exits. This was added before in PR #2411, but something went wrong there and it somehow got lost.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nI have changed one of the unit tests to work with the change, ran the test cases for the docker_operator, and testing airflow locally to check the docker container gets removed if `auto_remove=True` and not removed if `auto_remove=False`.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\nI updated the doc comment.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [AIRFLOW-2868](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2868) issue and references it in the PR title. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] I extended the mesos_executor to be able to execute different tasks with different CPU and Memory requirements, as well as different docker images. By providing an executor_config dictionary, users can specify these tasks in their operators. This builds off of the executor config created for the kubernetes_executor.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR added to tests/contrib/executors/test_mesos_executor.py\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it. \r\nPlease see comment below.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2886\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nIn my earlier PRs, https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/3651 and https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/3729 , I proposed to generate random `SECRET_KEY` for the `webserver` (Flask App).\r\n\r\nHowever, I realise that we may encounter CSRF error `The CSRF session token is missing` when we have multiple workers for the Flask webserver, since the secret_key is not consistent among workers.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it's still very important to have as random SECRET_KEY as possible for security reasons. We can deal with it like how we dealt with `FERNET_KEY` (i.e. generate a random value when the airflow.cfg file is initiated).\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2885\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n`get_params(page=0, search=\"abc\",showPaused=False)` returns `search=abc&showPaused=False`, while it's supposed to return `page=0&search=abc&showPaused=False` (`page` is 0-indexed).\r\n\r\nThis issue arose since `0` is considered as `False` by Python in conditional statement. `elif v` will not continue when `v` is `0` here, while it's supposed to continue.\r\n\r\nA test is added as well. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [✓] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2882\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [✓] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nCurrently, the pool only support set and get by one elements,\r\n`airflow pool [-h] [-s NAME SLOT_COUNT POOL_DESCRIPTION] [-g NAME] [-x NAME]`\r\nWith this changes, user can perform import & export similar as Variables so cli use JSON file to perform import & export operations. This will make deployment easier by setting up the pools via CICD pipeline as well. \r\nFor example, the import json file`{\"s3_pool\": {\"slots\":5, \"description\":\"This is my test s3_pool\"}}`\r\n--for import `airflow pool -i pools.json`\r\n--for export `airflow pool -e pools_e.json`\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [✓] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nUsing `{\r\n    \"s3_pool\": {\"slots\":5, \"description\":\"This is my test s3_pool\"},\r\n    \"s3_pool2\": {\"slots\":5, \"description\":\"This is my test s3_pool\"}\r\n}`\r\n\r\n- Tested `airflow pool -i pools.json` and use `airflow pool --get s3_pool` ╒═════════╤═════════╤═════════════════════════╕\r\n│ Pool    │   Slots │ Description             │\r\n╞═════════╪═════════╪═════════════════════════╡\r\n│ s3_pool │       5 │ This is my test s3_pool │\r\n╘═════════╧═════════╧═════════════════════════╛\r\n\r\n- Tested `airflow pool -e pools_e.json` and got \r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"s3_pool\": {\r\n        \"description\": \"This is my test s3_pool\",\r\n        \"slots\": 5\r\n    },\r\n    \"s3_pool2\": {\r\n        \"description\": \"This is my test s3_pool\",\r\n        \"slots\": 5\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [✓ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [✓] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  Added named arguments:\r\n`airflow pool -help`\r\n```\r\n  -i FILEPATH, --import FILEPATH\r\n                        Import pool from JSON file\r\n  -e FILEPATH, --export FILEPATH\r\n                        Export pool to JSON file\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [✓] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2883\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nIf the owners field are missing for a dag in airflow metadata db table(DAG),  we will encounter \"NoneType\" object has no attribute 'lower' when we do a search in UI. We should skip that dags in this case.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nno test. Trivial fix.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-09T18:34:07Z","updated_at":"2019-02-08T21:46:28Z","closed_at":"2018-12-24T19:06:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0833c5b45cf76a246f814cd1a7cc4d0bfa3b4824","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-2875\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2875\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-2875\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nWhen writing tmp config files, escapes the env variables, since they are read by `ConfigParser` when the tmp config file is loaded when the task is being run.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow 2874](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2874) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nIn an effort to make Apache Airflow a white label application, we should enable the FAB's theme support. Users can then easily change the theme according to their needs. There already exists a configuration to set the Navbar Color, that can be used in conjunction with the theme option, or can simply be unset to fully utilize the theme. List of available themes are available here: https://github.com/dpgaspar/Flask-AppBuilder-Skeleton/blob/master/config.py#L88\r\n_Note: Some of the dark themes might not work properly because of the charts that we are using at the moment._\r\nHere are some of the screenshots from different themes:\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2018-08-08 at 11 41 17 am](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25360476/43831843-bb6705d4-9b05-11e8-85cc-a818fb48c77a.png)\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2018-08-08 at 11 42 05 am](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25360476/43831844-bb812356-9b05-11e8-8429-3b06c8cf1a7a.png)\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2018-08-08 at 11 42 48 am](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25360476/43831846-bb9b7ada-9b05-11e8-9396-b8c9a67d84fa.png)\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2018-08-08 at 11 43 20 am](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25360476/43831847-bbb150da-9b05-11e8-98e3-29f32d0b71e1.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2872\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nTo implement the **Ad Hoc Query** view for RBAC under `/www_rbac`. It's mainly based on the current implementation in `/www`.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the implementation of `QueryView()` class is refined as listed below:\r\n\r\n- 1. The `.csv` button in `Ad Hoc Query` actually downloads a plain text file, while it should be a CSV file. Plain text file works too after changing extension to '.csv', but it would be nicer to directly respond with a CSV file.\r\nThis is addressed by changing `mimetype` to `text/csv`.\r\n\r\n- 2. Argument `has_data` which is passed to the template is not used at all in the template `airflow/query.html` (https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/blob/master/airflow/www/templates/airflow/query.html). It can be removed in the `self.render()`.\r\n\r\n- 3. We should respond with a CSV file only when user opts in for '.csv' AND the data is available ('df' is generated).  Otherwise we will encounter error below:  `UnboundLocalError: local variable 'df' referenced before assignment`.\r\n\r\n- 4. `result = df.to_html(...)` should only be invoked when user does NOT choose '.csv'. Otherwise it's a waste of resource to invoke `df.to_html()` since the result it returns will not be used at all if user asks for CSV downloading instead of a html page.\r\n\r\n- 5. remove a commented line.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new
