What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n#2218 \r\n\r\nfix bugs for issue 2218\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

doExport(), and we put appendProperties(this) in front of doExport().\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

file\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-14T03:23:14Z","updated_at":"2018-08-15T05:56:51Z","closed_at":"2018-08-15T05:56:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8109f68d0e90dea9d243fd3c8a1126a8ae224bce","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2281/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2281/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2281/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/dc96ad38e1e5b8df8461475eb4f0d53062a9dea6","head":{"label":"BlueMonds:master","ref":"master","sha":"dc96ad38e1e5b8df8461475eb4f0d53062a9dea6","user":{"login":"BlueMonds","id":20499864,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDk5ODY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20499864?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlueMonds","html_url":"https://github.com/BlueMonds","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlueMonds/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlueMonds/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlueMonds/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlueMonds/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlueMonds/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlueMonds/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlueMonds/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlueMonds/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlueMonds/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":144605312,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDQ2MDUzMTI=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"BlueMonds/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"BlueMonds","id":20499864,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDk5ODY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20499864?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlueMonds","html_url":"https://github.com/BlueMonds","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlueMonds/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlueMonds/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlueMonds/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlueMonds/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlueMonds/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlueMonds/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlueMonds/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlueMonds/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlueMonds/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/BlueMonds/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-14T03:00:12Z","updated_at":"2018-08-15T03:10:32Z","closed_at":"2018-08-15T03:10:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ee25fb6c408e83725ef35e82674825dc89b48608","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2275/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2275/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2275/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/ec863c1413f175bd3a5d69a41f7722e36845bd58","head":{"label":"Ziyang-Wu:team_5_unitTest","ref":"team_5_unitTest","sha":"ec863c1413f175bd3a5d69a41f7722e36845bd58","user":{"login":"Ziyang-Wu","id":33643149,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNjQzMTQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33643149?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ziyang-Wu","html_url":"https://github.com/Ziyang-Wu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ziyang-Wu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ziyang-Wu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ziyang-Wu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ziyang-Wu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ziyang-Wu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ziyang-Wu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ziyang-Wu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ziyang-Wu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ziyang-Wu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":144576000,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDQ1NzYwMDA=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"Ziyang-Wu/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Ziyang-Wu","id":33643149,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNjQzMTQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33643149?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ziyang-Wu","html_url":"https://github.com/Ziyang-Wu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ziyang-Wu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ziyang-Wu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ziyang-Wu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ziyang-Wu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ziyang-Wu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ziyang-Wu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ziyang-Wu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ziyang-Wu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ziyang-Wu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Ziyang-Wu/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

before judge delay\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n\r\n# issue3\r\n\r\n- bug复现\r\n\r\n  搜索export服务发布接口，设置断点进行问题复现 ------dubbo.properties中的delay配置不生效

 可以看到这里对延时进行了读取，所以问题找到了。就是在 if (delay != null && delay > 0)判断时 还没有读取properties中的参数设置。 解决就是在判断前进行读取appendProperties(this);\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n

method export() and doExport(), add method publish() in ServiceConfig.java, \r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThe issue is due to bug in the class ServiceConfig.\r\n\r\nWhen dubbo exports a service, there is a bean of ServiceConfig create by spring and the method export() is invoked. The bean of ServiceConfig is initialized by the configuration <dubbo:service /> in .xml. So in the method export(), the variable delay is initialized by <dubbo:service delay=\"5000\"/> and the system property does not work. \r\n\r\nTo fix this issue, I judge the variable delay in the method doExport() and the judgement is after the method appendProperties() which can check the overrides of the priorities and set the variables correct values.\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-14T02:48:21Z","updated_at":"2018-08-21T03:03:18Z","closed_at":"2018-08-21T03:03:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"92fb9a20d630e579bf462b44867e462a5bd1452c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":699742270,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTk3NDIyNzA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/labels/type/need-triage","name":"type/need-triage","color":"C5DEF5","default":false,"description":"Need

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix issue #1713 , by BaiJi the 269th team3\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\ncurrently supported logging framework: slf4j   jcl   log4j   jdk\r\nNow ,I add the log4j2 support\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-14T02:40:00Z","updated_at":"2018-08-15T05:56:51Z","closed_at":"2018-08-15T05:56:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"47d38daf36df6df78e4fab88de083604cbc92d8c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2266/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2266/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2266/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/a08313bdc0b925e2ed5111d18a5e091127760e7a","head":{"label":"hexiloveecho:issue4","ref":"issue4","sha":"a08313bdc0b925e2ed5111d18a5e091127760e7a","user":{"login":"hexiloveecho","id":19635308,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjM1MzA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19635308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hexiloveecho","html_url":"https://github.com/hexiloveecho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hexiloveecho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hexiloveecho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hexiloveecho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hexiloveecho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hexiloveecho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hexiloveecho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hexiloveecho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hexiloveecho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hexiloveecho/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":144554705,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDQ1NTQ3MDU=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"hexiloveecho/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hexiloveecho","id":19635308,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjM1MzA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19635308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hexiloveecho","html_url":"https://github.com/hexiloveecho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hexiloveecho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hexiloveecho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hexiloveecho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hexiloveecho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hexiloveecho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hexiloveecho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hexiloveecho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hexiloveecho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hexiloveecho/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hexiloveecho/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nbugfix to 1343\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nThe BUG has a port that already has the listen service in the map structure due to concurrency. Because the concurrency is too fast, the system thinks that there is no listener and continues to bind the service, so the same port listens to multiple processes.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-14T02:37:29Z","updated_at":"2018-08-15T03:19:09Z","closed_at":"2018-08-15T03:19:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6c04e279f6609618ca5919feddd8271864ada788","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2265/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2265/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2265/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/4ce9873e003aa72ef8d8b9f04dc95da9dc8052c7","head":{"label":"Leon1Zhu:master","ref":"master","sha":"4ce9873e003aa72ef8d8b9f04dc95da9dc8052c7","user":{"login":"Leon1Zhu","id":16640084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NjQwMDg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16640084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leon1Zhu","html_url":"https://github.com/Leon1Zhu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leon1Zhu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leon1Zhu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leon1Zhu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leon1Zhu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leon1Zhu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leon1Zhu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leon1Zhu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leon1Zhu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leon1Zhu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":144548297,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDQ1NDgyOTc=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"Leon1Zhu/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Leon1Zhu","id":16640084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NjQwMDg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16640084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leon1Zhu","html_url":"https://github.com/Leon1Zhu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leon1Zhu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leon1Zhu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leon1Zhu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leon1Zhu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leon1Zhu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leon1Zhu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leon1Zhu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leon1Zhu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leon1Zhu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Leon1Zhu/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nfix issue #2177  Team 9\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-14T02:28:21Z","updated_at":"2018-08-15T02:39:03Z","closed_at":"2018-08-15T02:39:03Z","merged_at":"2018-08-15T02:39:03Z","merge_commit_sha":"92c566a381f44c685139a399aad21981bea71ea9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2261/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2261/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2261/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/26929a99b54986caeac4b31715bf7c8ce6f67a6f","head":{"label":"zhinieing:baiji9","ref":"baiji9","sha":"26929a99b54986caeac4b31715bf7c8ce6f67a6f","user":{"login":"zhinieing","id":18330439,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzMwNDM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18330439?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhinieing","html_url":"https://github.com/zhinieing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhinieing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhinieing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhinieing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhinieing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhinieing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhinieing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhinieing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhinieing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhinieing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":144554663,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDQ1NTQ2NjM=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"zhinieing/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zhinieing","id":18330439,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzMwNDM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18330439?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhinieing","html_url":"https://github.com/zhinieing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhinieing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhinieing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhinieing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhinieing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhinieing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhinieing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhinieing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhinieing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhinieing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zhinieing/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix issue #2177 By BaiJi  the 269th team 3\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nThe following branches have been Unit Tested:\r\n    org.apache.dubbo.registry.support.AbstractRegistry#register\r\n    org.apache.dubbo.registry.support.AbstractRegistry#unregister\r\n    org.apache.dubbo.registry.support.AbstractRegistry#subscribe\r\n

[x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-14T02:26:59Z","updated_at":"2018-08-15T03:07:51Z","closed_at":"2018-08-15T03:07:51Z","merged_at":"2018-08-15T03:07:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"f364a44fa21c90120749de4335ce1cee4215536d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2260/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2260/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2260/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/faeec6810383b3ef71ba60673bd514b4bfc5d4a3","head":{"label":"lhjlhj13141314:master","ref":"master","sha":"faeec6810383b3ef71ba60673bd514b4bfc5d4a3","user":{"login":"lhjlhj13141314","id":39083015,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MDgzMDE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39083015?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhjlhj13141314","html_url":"https://github.com/lhjlhj13141314","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhjlhj13141314/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhjlhj13141314/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhjlhj13141314/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhjlhj13141314/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhjlhj13141314/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhjlhj13141314/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhjlhj13141314/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhjlhj13141314/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhjlhj13141314/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":144587392,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDQ1ODczOTI=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"lhjlhj13141314/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lhjlhj13141314","id":39083015,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MDgzMDE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39083015?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhjlhj13141314","html_url":"https://github.com/lhjlhj13141314","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhjlhj13141314/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhjlhj13141314/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhjlhj13141314/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhjlhj13141314/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhjlhj13141314/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhjlhj13141314/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhjlhj13141314/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhjlhj13141314/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lhjlhj13141314/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lhjlhj13141314/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nSolve the issues2218\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nAdded judgment that the parameter is empty.\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-14T02:26:37Z","updated_at":"2018-08-15T05:46:51Z","closed_at":"2018-08-15T05:46:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8d1c30ed726d0d71665f3c8fe27de9dc64b454ff","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2259/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2259/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2259/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/11bca248532293b12b401cac635e3744fd9834e5","head":{"label":"xujunjie97:fix_issues2218_team_10","ref":"fix_issues2218_team_10","sha":"11bca248532293b12b401cac635e3744fd9834e5","user":{"login":"xujunjie97","id":20533603,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTMzNjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20533603?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xujunjie97","html_url":"https://github.com/xujunjie97","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xujunjie97/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xujunjie97/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xujunjie97/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xujunjie97/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xujunjie97/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xujunjie97/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xujunjie97/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xujunjie97/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xujunjie97/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":144651934,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDQ2NTE5MzQ=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"xujunjie97/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xujunjie97","id":20533603,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTMzNjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20533603?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xujunjie97","html_url":"https://github.com/xujunjie97","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xujunjie97/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xujunjie97/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xujunjie97/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xujunjie97/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xujunjie97/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xujunjie97/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xujunjie97/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xujunjie97/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xujunjie97/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xujunjie97/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

1343， by BaiJi the 269th team3\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\nA port conflict problem of dubbo provider when multiple services start concurrently.\r\n\r\nIf you use a dynamic port, Dubbo will detect it first, then listen. If multiple processes start concurrently, it will cause the same port to be used occasionally.\r\n\r\nIf the dubbo port configuration of both threads is -1, if two ports occupy a conflict, one of the processes will retry.\r\n\r\nIf the dubbo port configuration of one thread is -1, and another is set to be fixed (such as 20880), if the process whose port is configured as -1 preempts port 20880, the process with the port number of 20880 will be retried three time. If retries still fail after three times, just try out new ports incrementally.\r\n\r\nIf the dubbo port configuration of both threads is a fixed port (such as 20880), then when one process occupies 20880 ports, another process will retry three times and will be assigned an available port(not 20880). .\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nThe simple fix is ​​to re-probe the dynamic port if it fails.\r\n\r\nIf the number of retries for a port is more than three, then the port of the dubbo service is set to -1, and the available port will be dynamically obtained.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-14T02:20:56Z","updated_at":"2018-08-15T03:19:47Z","closed_at":"2018-08-15T03:19:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7ad6709126a5b2b061e0aa62021443d3e2e95051","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2258/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2258/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2258/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/297c557fa5d6b3091ad51c6385539dcebcd1cc92","head":{"label":"YangAidi:issue2","ref":"issue2","sha":"297c557fa5d6b3091ad51c6385539dcebcd1cc92","user":{"login":"YangAidi","id":27003719,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDAzNzE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27003719?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/YangAidi","html_url":"https://github.com/YangAidi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YangAidi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YangAidi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YangAidi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YangAidi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YangAidi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YangAidi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YangAidi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YangAidi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YangAidi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"1c16f78036b96582166c194d6142436399a1ce5a","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

[GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn

Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix Issue #1728\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\nFile Changed:\r\ndubbo-config/dubbo-config-api/src/main/java/org/apache/dubbo/config/ServiceConfig.java\r\n\r\nMain Change:\r\nMove the invoke of Method appendProperties(this) before the null test of 'delay' parameter\r\n\r\nAim:\r\n1 Ensure the order of the properties mapping，JVM's > XML's > Properties File's.\r\n2 Do the \"delay\"'s null test after JVM parameters' loading.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nChanges have been tested with different cases:\r\n1 The order of properties loading\r\n2 The override of different mapping methods\r\n3 The correctness of properties loading\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

highest.\r\n\r\nBaiJi training camp 269 Team No.6, Alibaba-Inc.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix issue #1728， by BaiJi the 269th team3\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nMake the priority of the delay arg in JVM args the highest, which can override the delay arg set in .xml and .properties files.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nfix the issue in #1343 port conflict\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nAfter the process fail to bind the port, retry to get a new port and try again. \r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nWhen one process export its service in one random port, this port was choose as another thread's port. When it fails one time, then give the process a random port.\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nadd some unit test for cache, notifying and destroying\r\nreply for #2177  Team 4\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).","created_at":"2018-08-13T13:51:41Z","updated_at":"2018-08-15T03:10:21Z","closed_at":"2018-08-15T03:10:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a8f3c146cd8992fb1691d26001fbc5bf4abedb37","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2239/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2239/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2239/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/ef1c9f8fd1727bdf45169e3dc387fb15014f3098","head":{"label":"ywtdzh:unit-test-AbstractRegistry","ref":"unit-test-AbstractRegistry","sha":"ef1c9f8fd1727bdf45169e3dc387fb15014f3098","user":{"login":"ywtdzh","id":16068706,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDY4NzA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16068706?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywtdzh","html_url":"https://github.com/ywtdzh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywtdzh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywtdzh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywtdzh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywtdzh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywtdzh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywtdzh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywtdzh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywtdzh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywtdzh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":144549855,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDQ1NDk4NTU=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"ywtdzh/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ywtdzh","id":16068706,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDY4NzA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16068706?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywtdzh","html_url":"https://github.com/ywtdzh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywtdzh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywtdzh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywtdzh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywtdzh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywtdzh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywtdzh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywtdzh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywtdzh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ywtdzh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ywtdzh/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn

Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-13T10:46:51Z","updated_at":"2018-08-15T06:02:06Z","closed_at":"2018-08-15T06:02:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"21a7494db325353db4e4e7dc7700f50c8d0ba668","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2236/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2236/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2236/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/da9dc8d535a7d0c6eb336ad712154d8c355649c2","head":{"label":"zhuguorong11:master","ref":"master","sha":"da9dc8d535a7d0c6eb336ad712154d8c355649c2","user":{"login":"zhuguorong11","id":20261584,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMjYxNTg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20261584?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuguorong11","html_url":"https://github.com/zhuguorong11","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuguorong11/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuguorong11/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuguorong11/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuguorong11/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuguorong11/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuguorong11/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuguorong11/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuguorong11/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuguorong11/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":144556981,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDQ1NTY5ODE=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"zhuguorong11/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zhuguorong11","id":20261584,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMjYxNTg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20261584?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuguorong11","html_url":"https://github.com/zhuguorong11","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuguorong11/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuguorong11/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuguorong11/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuguorong11/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuguorong11/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuguorong11/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuguorong11/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuguorong11/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhuguorong11/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zhuguorong11/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

[x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-13T03:25:51Z","updated_at":"2018-08-16T09:58:27Z","closed_at":"2018-08-16T09:58:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e2b791875507f8b2fc55240b10461de0b8c07205","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2231/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2231/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2231/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/bb58889063e412eb8773f649d1ab84f3588ccbf2","head":{"label":"elvis9xu163:master","ref":"master","sha":"bb58889063e412eb8773f649d1ab84f3588ccbf2","user":{"login":"elvis9xu163","id":31066340,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMDY2MzQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31066340?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elvis9xu163","html_url":"https://github.com/elvis9xu163","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elvis9xu163/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elvis9xu163/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elvis9xu163/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elvis9xu163/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elvis9xu163/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elvis9xu163/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elvis9xu163/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elvis9xu163/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elvis9xu163/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":144136500,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDQxMzY1MDA=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"elvis9xu163/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"elvis9xu163","id":31066340,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMDY2MzQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31066340?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elvis9xu163","html_url":"https://github.com/elvis9xu163","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elvis9xu163/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elvis9xu163/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elvis9xu163/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elvis9xu163/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elvis9xu163/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elvis9xu163/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elvis9xu163/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elvis9xu163/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elvis9xu163/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/elvis9xu163/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\noptimize the way of parsing url(string)\r\n\r\nit's a trivial change for learnig how to contribute dubbo,\r\nif there's any problem,please tell me and i will fix it.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nadd a nested class\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-13T01:27:52Z","updated_at":"2018-08-13T02:39:52Z","closed_at":"2018-08-13T02:39:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6c0a6a77fb0167c657fbef0efc7721e345134da4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2230/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2230/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2230/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/3548e57ecddc319ce05c9160af1e424ac30cfa71","head":{"label":"lllichen:fixCode","ref":"fixCode","sha":"3548e57ecddc319ce05c9160af1e424ac30cfa71","user":{"login":"lllichen","id":11263332,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjYzMzMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11263332?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lllichen","html_url":"https://github.com/lllichen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lllichen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lllichen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lllichen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lllichen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lllichen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lllichen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lllichen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lllichen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lllichen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"e35084015b6af5b39fe8dca279202e81d59ce082","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

fact2: some applications didn't change ,but deploy repeatedly，like D,E.\r\n- fact3: if a new feature need to be tested, all 5 application need to be deployed.\r\n- fact4: isolation by feature  is not friendly to parallel development.\r\n\r\n### use tag\r\n\r\n![isolation by tag](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11485990/43990957-8b0508f4-9d95-11e8-8373-e522df81a227.png)\r\n\r\n- fact:

TagRouter,TagRouterFactory.\r\n- add SPI statement for adding TagRouter automatically.\r\n- fix a small bug(may be not) in `org.apache.dubbo.registry.integration.RegistryDirectory#route`，exclude runtime routers, avoid to filter some runtime invokers.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nHere is more detail about Unit Test:\r\n`org.apache.dubbo.rpc.cluster.router.tag.TagRouterTest`\r\nI have verified that the unit test has been correct and passed.\r\n\r\nHere is more detail about a Integration Test:\r\nclone the repository `https://github.com/lexburner/Dubbo-Sample-TagRouter.git`,can see the route tag feature.\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-11T08:56:26Z","updated_at":"2020-07-20T07:45:30Z","closed_at":"2018-08-22T08:17:44Z","merged_at":"2018-08-22T08:17:44Z","merge_commit_sha":"fcd1af81fd2fd6ad55c78f281d7b29feb10a006a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":699741254,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTk3NDEyNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/labels/status/waiting-for-feedback","name":"status/waiting-for-feedback","color":"C2E0C6","default":false,"description":"Need

[GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-10T05:53:18Z","updated_at":"2018-08-13T03:29:51Z","closed_at":"2018-08-13T03:28:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2225/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2225/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2225/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/57b0efd176ec16acc5edc8d2e254bedf0d033082","head":{"label":"elvis9xu163:issuefix_2218","ref":"issuefix_2218","sha":"57b0efd176ec16acc5edc8d2e254bedf0d033082","user":{"login":"elvis9xu163","id":31066340,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMDY2MzQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31066340?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elvis9xu163","html_url":"https://github.com/elvis9xu163","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elvis9xu163/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elvis9xu163/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elvis9xu163/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elvis9xu163/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elvis9xu163/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elvis9xu163/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elvis9xu163/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elvis9xu163/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elvis9xu163/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":144136500,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDQxMzY1MDA=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"elvis9xu163/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"elvis9xu163","id":31066340,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMDY2MzQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31066340?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elvis9xu163","html_url":"https://github.com/elvis9xu163","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elvis9xu163/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elvis9xu163/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elvis9xu163/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elvis9xu163/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elvis9xu163/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elvis9xu163/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elvis9xu163/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elvis9xu163/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elvis9xu163/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/elvis9xu163/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-09T08:18:53Z","updated_at":"2018-08-13T02:48:41Z","closed_at":"2018-08-13T02:48:41Z","merged_at":"2018-08-13T02:48:41Z","merge_commit_sha":"8beeb649f2941b6b5941895ebc3ef8ab260c1f9e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2220/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2220/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2220/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/c4b920e2b700ac62f0e6e1d66b91b69f17bd49df","head":{"label":"chickenlj:kryo-java8-datetime","ref":"kryo-java8-datetime","sha":"c4b920e2b700ac62f0e6e1d66b91b69f17bd49df","user":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":133750259,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzM3NTAyNTk=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"chickenlj/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

intergration-test passed\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-07T03:55:30Z","updated_at":"2018-08-13T07:44:35Z","closed_at":"2018-08-13T07:44:35Z","merged_at":"2018-08-13T07:44:35Z","merge_commit_sha":"1c16f78036b96582166c194d6142436399a1ce5a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":699741254,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTk3NDEyNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/labels/status/waiting-for-feedback","name":"status/waiting-for-feedback","color":"C2E0C6","default":false,"description":"Need

easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

change\r\n\r\nwrite an unit-test and passed\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-07T03:47:17Z","updated_at":"2018-08-13T06:46:21Z","closed_at":"2018-08-13T06:43:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"15309954cc549797a90fac96c4a4ceafbe4a7ee0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":699741254,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTk3NDEyNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/labels/status/waiting-for-feedback","name":"status/waiting-for-feedback","color":"C2E0C6","default":false,"description":"Need

What is the purpose of the change\r\n修复 #2178 对于空构造函数的 kryo 序列化问题\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n写了一个 kryo 的拓展类，增强 kryo 序列化能力\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n包含单元测试，测试全部通过\r\n\r\n## Way\r\n由于 kryo 工具在作对象序列化的时候会调用到对象的默认构造方法，但是对于 LocalDateTime 这一类的类没有默认构造方法导致序列化失败。\r\n对 kryo 的序列化类进行拓展，对于这一些特殊类，在它无法找到对应的序列化器，可以使用反射工厂生成对应的默认构造函数。\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-07T03:47:12Z","updated_at":"2018-08-09T08:41:17Z","closed_at":"2018-08-09T08:41:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a21094936fcaa89a57dcf23a69ef0afab38b103d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":699742270,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTk3NDIyNzA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/labels/type/need-triage","name":"type/need-triage","color":"C5DEF5","default":false,"description":"Need

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nSolve Issue #655, update jetty version to 9 and improve test case\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n- Modified dependencies-bom/pom.xml file,dubbo-test/pom.xml\r\n- add test function in org.apache.dubbo.remoting.http.jetty.JettyHttpBinderTest\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- `org.apache.dubbo.remoting.http.jetty.JettyHttpBinderTest` test passed\r\n- Exsiting unit-test and intergration-test passed\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

intergration-test passed\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

[issue2136](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues/2136)\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

change\r\nall test passed\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nUse CompletableFuture to rewrite the embedded ListenableFuture.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n- Remove embedded listenableFuture and listenableFutureTask\r\n- Packaging the CompletableFuture to CompletableFutureTask.\r\n- Remove the original listenableFutureTask unit test and added the new completableFuture Task.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- [issue#2187](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues/2187)\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

[GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-07T03:10:58Z","updated_at":"2018-08-09T03:00:40Z","closed_at":"2018-08-09T03:00:40Z","merged_at":"2018-08-09T03:00:40Z","merge_commit_sha":"518c5961e69ac6f1a5e48b193dc52b55d208f5d7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/18","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/18","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/18/labels","id":3481802,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMzQ4MTgwMg==","number":18,"title":"2.7.0","description":"An

us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

[GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

change\r\n\r\nunit test pass\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

Verifying this change\r\n\r\nmvn test pass\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-06T04:03:36Z","updated_at":"2018-08-06T06:19:58Z","closed_at":"2018-08-06T06:19:58Z","merged_at":"2018-08-06T06:19:58Z","merge_commit_sha":"940e3553b0b94c1df23b79a2f523293251b20d6f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2189/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/2189/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/2189/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/da975ed24e73040eb6748729c717e62845819db2","head":{"label":"lllichen:fixCode","ref":"fixCode","sha":"da975ed24e73040eb6748729c717e62845819db2","user":{"login":"lllichen","id":11263332,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjYzMzMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11263332?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lllichen","html_url":"https://github.com/lllichen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lllichen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lllichen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lllichen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lllichen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lllichen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lllichen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lllichen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lllichen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lllichen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"5de6c76f063195dabd037601c158c533d0356582","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nrelated to #2174 \r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nsame fix on monitor in 2.7.x\r\n\r\nbecause there is bug which willl block shutdown progress in 2.5.x and it was fixed in 2.6.3.\r\n\r\nrelated: #2110\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAn effort for metadata refactor, #2030 .\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n* New module: dubbo-config-dynamic\r\n* RegistryProtocol\r\n* RegistryDirectory\r\n\r\nOther works to do:\r\n* Rerefer and Reexport process\r\n* Redesign of Configuration format and granularity\r\n* Subscription and unsubscription\r\n* Dynamic config HA\r\n* Refining the URL to the registry\r\n* Some configuration items are in ApplicationConfig now: dynamic configuration type, address.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n1. Configuration format (ZK by default):\r\n* ZK path, `/dubbo/config/demo-provider/org.apache.dubbo.demo.DemoService.CONFIGURATORS`\r\n* Content\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n\t\"service\": \"org.apache.dubbo.demo.DemoService\",\r\n\t\"items\": [{\r\n\t\t\"addresses\": [\"0.0.0.0\"],\r\n\t\t\"rules\": [{\r\n\t\t\t\"key\": \"weight\",\r\n\t\t\t\"value\": 500\r\n\t\t}],\r\n\t\t\"app\": \"demo-provider\",\r\n\t\t\"side\": \"provider\"\r\n\t}]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation
