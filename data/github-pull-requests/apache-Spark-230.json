If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently, in the following scenario, bucket join is not utilized:\r\n```scala\r\nval df = (0 until 20).map(i => (i, i)).toDF(\"i\", \"j\").as(\"df\")\r\ndf.write.format(\"parquet\").bucketBy(8, \"i\").saveAsTable(\"t\")\r\nsql(\"CREATE VIEW v AS SELECT * FROM t\")\r\nsql(\"SELECT * FROM t a JOIN v b ON a.i = b.i\").explain\r\n```\r\n```\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\n*(4) SortMergeJoin [i#13], [i#15], Inner\r\n:- *(1) Sort [i#13 ASC NULLS FIRST], false, 0\r\n:  +- *(1) Project [i#13, j#14]\r\n:     +- *(1) Filter isnotnull(i#13)\r\n:        +- *(1) ColumnarToRow\r\n:           +- FileScan parquet default.t[i#13,j#14] Batched: true, DataFilters: [isnotnull(i#13)], Format: Parquet, Location: InMemoryFileIndex[file:..., PartitionFilters: [], PushedFilters: [IsNotNull(i)], ReadSchema: struct<i:int,j:int>, SelectedBucketsCount: 8 out of 8\r\n+- *(3) Sort [i#15 ASC NULLS FIRST], false, 0\r\n   +- Exchange hashpartitioning(i#15, 8), true, [id=#64] <----- Exchange node introduced\r\n      +- *(2) Project [i#13 AS i#15, j#14 AS j#16]\r\n         +- *(2) Filter isnotnull(i#13)\r\n            +- *(2) ColumnarToRow\r\n               +- FileScan parquet default.t[i#13,j#14] Batched: true, DataFilters: [isnotnull(i#13)], Format: Parquet, Location: InMemoryFileIndex[file:..., PartitionFilters: [], PushedFilters: [IsNotNull(i)], ReadSchema: struct<i:int,j:int>, SelectedBucketsCount: 8 out of 8\r\n```\r\nNotice that `Exchange` is present. This is because `Project` introduces aliases and `outputPartitioning` and `requiredChildDistribution` do not consider aliases while considering bucket join in `EnsureRequirements`. This PR addresses to allow this scenario.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis allows bucket join to be utilized in the above example.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, now with the fix, the `explain` out is as follows:\r\n```\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\n*(3) SortMergeJoin [i#13], [i#15], Inner\r\n:- *(1) Sort [i#13 ASC NULLS FIRST], false, 0\r\n:  +- *(1) Project [i#13, j#14]\r\n:     +- *(1) Filter isnotnull(i#13)\r\n:        +- *(1) ColumnarToRow\r\n:           +- FileScan parquet default.t[i#13,j#14] Batched: true, DataFilters: [isnotnull(i#13)], Format: Parquet, Location: InMemoryFileIndex[file:.., PartitionFilters: [], PushedFilters: [IsNotNull(i)], ReadSchema: struct<i:int,j:int>, SelectedBucketsCount: 8 out of 8\r\n+- *(2) Sort [i#15 ASC NULLS FIRST], false, 0\r\n   +- *(2) Project [i#13 AS i#15, j#14 AS j#16]\r\n      +- *(2) Filter isnotnull(i#13)\r\n         +- *(2) ColumnarToRow\r\n            +- FileScan parquet default.t[i#13,j#14] Batched: true, DataFilters: [isnotnull(i#13)], Format: Parquet, Location: InMemoryFileIndex[file:.., PartitionFilters: [], PushedFilters: [IsNotNull(i)], ReadSchema: struct<i:int,j:int>, SelectedBucketsCount: 8 out of 8\r\n```\r\nNote that the `Exchange` is no longer present.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-19T06:06:39Z","updated_at":"2020-03-07T05:28:17Z","closed_at":"2020-01-23T23:23:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7d72b84ee214f90ec128219b9fbe5d2c2cc9d5a4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26943/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26943/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26943/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/fbafedf8793554366135b4d41189e06feb6f875e","head":{"label":"imback82:bucket_alias","ref":"bucket_alias","sha":"fbafedf8793554366135b4d41189e06feb6f875e","user":{"login":"imback82","id":12103644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTAzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12103644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82","html_url":"https://github.com/imback82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":190453549,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTA0NTM1NDk=","name":"spark-4","full_name":"imback82/spark-4","private":false,"owner":{"login":"imback82","id":12103644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTAzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12103644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82","html_url":"https://github.com/imback82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/imback82/spark-4","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/26548#pullrequestreview-334345333, some test cases in `RecordBinaryComparatorSuite` use a fixed arrayOffset when writing to long arrays, this  could lead to weird stuff including crashing with a SIGSEGV.\r\n\r\nThis PR fix the problem by computing the arrayOffset based on `Platform.LONG_ARRAY_OFFSET`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTested locally. Previously, when we try to add `System.gc()` between write into long array and compare by RecordBinaryComparator, there is a chance to hit JVM crash with SIGSEGV like:\r\n```\r\n#\r\n# A fatal error has been detected by the Java Runtime Environment:\r\n#\r\n#  SIGSEGV (0xb) at pc=0x00007efc66970bcb, pid=11831, tid=0x00007efc0f9f9700\r\n#\r\n# JRE version: OpenJDK Runtime Environment (8.0_222-b10) (build 1.8.0_222-8u222-b10-1ubuntu1~16.04.1-b10)\r\n# Java VM: OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (25.222-b10 mixed mode linux-amd64 compressed oops)\r\n# Problematic frame:\r\n# V  [libjvm.so+0x5fbbcb]\r\n#\r\n# Core dump written. Default location: /home/jenkins/workspace/sql/core/core or core.11831\r\n#\r\n# An error report file with more information is saved as:\r\n# /home/jenkins/workspace/sql/core/hs_err_pid11831.log\r\n#\r\n# If you would like to submit a bug report, please visit:\r\n#   http://bugreport.java.com/bugreport/crash.jsp\r\n#\r\n```\r\nAfter the fix those test cases didn't crash the JVM anymore.\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-19T00:45:07Z","updated_at":"2020-02-05T18:23:16Z","closed_at":"2019-12-19T09:02:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3aa522908c4595d7220c5daa19538095d17c4d31","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26939/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26939/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26939/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/dc8f01766ff0b838bc5f750bfb2921af64eb5a01","head":{"label":"jiangxb1987:rbc","ref":"rbc","sha":"dc8f01766ff0b838bc5f750bfb2921af64eb5a01","user":{"login":"jiangxb1987","id":4784782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4784782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35214686,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTIxNDY4Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"jiangxb1987/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jiangxb1987","id":4784782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4784782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987/spark","description":"Mirror

**What changes were proposed in this pull request?**\r\n\r\n**Backgroud**\r\nThe driver can't sense this executor was lost through the network connection disconnection If an executor was lost in the network and it have not responsed rst and close packet to driver, so driver can only sense this executor dead through heartbeat expired.\r\n\r\n**Problems**\r\nHeartbeat expiration processing flow as follows:\r\n1. Executor heartbeat expired as above.\r\n2. HeartbeatReceiver will call scheduler executor lost to rescheduler the tasks on this executor.\r\n3. HeartbeatReceiver kill the executor.\r\n\r\nThe tasks on the dead executor have a chance to rescheduled on this dead executor again if the task rescheduler before the executor has't remove from executorBackend, it will send launch task to this executor again, the executor will not response and the driver can't sense through heartbeat beause the executor has lost in network. This cause those tasks rescheduled on this lost executor can't finish forever, and the app will hung up here forever.\r\nThis patch fix this problem, it remove the executor before rescheduler.\r\n\r\n### **Why are the changes needed?**\r\nThis will cause app hung up.\r\n\r\n### **Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?**\r\nNO\r\n\r\n### **How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdds a `diff` transformation to `Dataset` that computes the differences between the two datasets, i.e. which rows of `this` dataset to _add_, _delete_ or _change_ to get to the given dataset.\r\n\r\nWith\r\n```\r\nval left = Seq((1, \"one\"), (2, \"two\"), (3, \"three\")).toDF(\"id\", \"value\")\r\nval right = Seq((1, \"one\"), (2, \"Two\"), (4, \"four\")).toDF(\"id\", \"value\")\r\n```\r\nDiffing becomes as easy as:\r\n```\r\nleft.diff(right).show()\r\n```\r\n|diff| id|value|\r\n|----|---|-----|\r\n|   N|  1|  one|\r\n|   D|  2|  two|\r\n|   I|  2|  Two|\r\n|   D|  3|three|\r\n|   I|  4| four|\r\n\r\nWith columns that provide unique identifiers per row (here `id`), the diff looks like:\r\n```\r\nleft.diff(right, \"id\").show()\r\n```\r\n|diff| id|left_value|right_value|\r\n|----|---|----------|-----------|\r\n|   N|  1|       one|        one|\r\n|   C|  2|       two|        Two|\r\n|   D|  3|     three|       null|\r\n|   I|  4|      null|       four|\r\n\r\n\r\nEquivalent alternative is this hand-crafted transformation\r\n```\r\nleft.withColumn(\"exists\", lit(1)).as(\"l\")\r\n  .join(right.withColumn(\"exists\", lit(1)).as(\"r\"),\r\n    $\"l.id\" <=> $\"r.id\",\r\n    \"fullouter\")\r\n  .withColumn(\"diff\",\r\n    when($\"l.exists\".isNull, \"I\").\r\n      when($\"r.exists\".isNull, \"D\").\r\n      when(!($\"l.value\" <=> $\"r.value\"), \"C\").\r\n      otherwise(\"N\"))\r\n  .show()\r\n```\r\n\r\nStatistics on the differences can be obtained by\r\n```\r\nleft.diff(right, \"id\").groupBy(\"diff\").count().show()\r\n```\r\n\r\n|diff|count|\r\n|----|-----|\r\n|   N|    1|\r\n|   I|    1|\r\n|   D|    1|\r\n|   C|    1|\r\n\r\nThis `diff` provides the following features:\r\n* id columns are optional\r\n* provides typed `diffAs` transformations\r\n* supports null values in id and non-id columns\r\n* detects null value insertion / deletion\r\n* configurable via `DiffOptions`:\r\n  * diff column name (default: `\"diff\"`), for diffing datasets that already contain `diff` column\r\n  * diff action labels (defaults: `\"N\"`, `\"I\"`, `\"D\"`, `\"C\"`), allows custom diff notation,\r\ne.g. Unix diff left-right notation (<, >) or git before-after format (+, -, -+)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nYour evolving code need frequent regression testing to prove it still produces identical results, or if changes are expected, to investigate those changes. Diffing the results of two code paths provides the confidence you need. Diffing small schemata is easy, but with wide schema the Spark query becomes laborious and error-prone. With a single proven and tested method, diffing becomes easier and a more reliable operation. This has proven to be useful for interactive spark as well as deployed production code.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, it provides new transformations added to `Dataset`:\r\n\r\n* `def diff(other: Dataset[T], idColumns: String*): DataFrame`\r\n* `def diff(other: Dataset[T], options: DiffOptions, idColumns: String*): DataFrame`\r\n* `def diffAs[U](other: Dataset[T], idColumns: String*)(implicit diffEncoder: Encoder[U]): Dataset[U]`\r\n* `def diffAs[U](other: Dataset[T], options: DiffOptions, idColumns: String*)(implicit diffEncoder: Encoder[U]):

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThere's a concept of 'read-only' and 'read+write' state store in Spark which is defined \"implicitly\". Spark doesn't prevent write for 'read-only' state store; Spark just assumes read-only stateful operator will not modify the state store. Given it's not defined explicitly, the instance of state store has to be implemented as 'read+write' even it's being used as 'read-only', which sometimes brings confusion.\r\n\r\nFor example, abort() in HDFSBackedStateStore - https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/d38f8167483d4d79e8360f24a8c0bffd51460659/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/streaming/state/HDFSBackedStateStoreProvider.scala#L143-L155\r\n\r\nThe comment sounds as if statement works differently between 'read-only' and 'read+write', but that's not true as both state store has state initialized as UPDATING (no difference). So 'read-only' state also creates the temporary file, initializes output streams to write to temporary file, closes output streams, and finally deletes the temporary file. This unnecessary operations are being done per batch/partition.\r\n\r\nThis patch explicitly defines 'read-only' StateStore, and enables state store provider to create 'read-only' StateStore instance if requested. Relevant code paths are modified, as well as 'read-only' StateStore implementation for HDFSBackedStateStore is introduced. The new implementation gets rid of unnecessary operations explained above.\r\n\r\nIn point of backward-compatibility view, the only thing being changed in public API side is `StateStoreProvider`. The trait `StateStoreProvider` has to be changed to allow requesting 'read-only' StateStore; this patch adds default implementation which leverages 'read+write' StateStore but wrapping with 'write-protected' StateStore instance, so that custom providers don't need to change their code to reflect the change. But if the providers can optimize for read-only workload, they'll be happy to make a change.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this patch makes ReadOnlyStateStore extend StateStore and being referred as StateStore, as StateStore is being used in so many places and it's not easy to support both traits if we differentiate them. So unfortunately these write methods are still exposed for read-only state; it just throws UnsupportedOperationException.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe new API opens the chance to optimize read-only state store instance compared with read+write state store instance. HDFSBackedStateStoreProvider is modified to provide read-only version of state store which doesn't deal with temporary file as well as state machine.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nClearly \"no\" for most end users, and also \"no\" for custom state store providers as it doesn't touch trait `StateStore` as well as provides default implementation for added method in trait `StateStoreProvider`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nModified UT. Existing UTs ensure the change doesn't break anything.","created_at":"2019-12-18T09:08:07Z","updated_at":"2020-11-05T09:22:06Z","closed_at":"2020-11-05T09:21:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"82a624abbd5ad94afca96f000c2e4dd769144948","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIf spark.sql.ansi.enabled is set,\r\nthrow exception when cast to any numeric type do not follow the ANSI SQL standards.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nANSI SQL standards do not allow invalid strings to get casted into numeric types and throw exception for that. Currently spark sql gives NULL in such cases. \r\n\r\nBefore: \r\n`select cast('str' as decimal)  => NULL`\r\n\r\nAfter :\r\n`select cast('str' as decimal) => invalid input syntax for type numeric: str`\r\n\r\nThese results are after setting `spark.sql.ansi.enabled=true`\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes. Now when ansi mode is on users will get arithmetic exception for invalid strings.\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit Tests Added.\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-18T06:14:43Z","updated_at":"2020-01-14T09:03:36Z","closed_at":"2020-01-14T09:03:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4ee19556cafa9e718494be83815d9d10f9e7cb42","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26933/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26933/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26933/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0cb4edc3a42badfff3f2ecca7b2ec468ad0f0c2d","head":{"label":"iRakson:castDecimalANSI","ref":"castDecimalANSI","sha":"0cb4edc3a42badfff3f2ecca7b2ec468ad0f0c2d","user":{"login":"iRakson","id":15366835,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzY2ODM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15366835?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRakson","html_url":"https://github.com/iRakson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRakson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRakson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRakson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRakson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRakson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRakson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRakson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRakson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRakson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":205127207,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDUxMjcyMDc=","name":"spark","full_name":"iRakson/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"iRakson","id":15366835,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzY2ODM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15366835?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRakson","html_url":"https://github.com/iRakson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRakson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRakson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRakson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRakson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRakson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRakson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRakson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRakson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iRakson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/iRakson/spark","description":"Apache

not appear that content will be added to the module for Spark 3, so I propose avoiding committing to the modules, which are no-ops now, in the upcoming major 3.0 release.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, the modules were not released.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests, but mostly

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWith the development of Spark and Hive，in current `sql/hive-thriftserver`, we need to do a lot of work to solve code conflicts between different hive versions. It's an annoying and unending work in current ways. And these issues are troubling us when we develop new features for the SparkThriftServer2. We suppose to implement a new thrift server based on latest v11 `TCLService.thrift` thrift protocol. Implement all API in spark's own code to get rid of hive code .\r\n    Finally, the new thrift server have below feature:\r\n1. support all functions current `hive-thriftserver` support\r\n2. use all code maintained by spark itself\r\n3. realize origin function fit to spark’s own feature, won't limited by hive's code\r\n4. support running without hive metastore or with hive metastore\r\n5. support user impersonation by Multi-tenant authority separation,  hive authentication and DFS authentication\r\n6. add a new module `spark-jdbc`, with connection url  `jdbc:spark:<host>:<port>/<db>`, all `hive-jdbc` support we will all support\r\n7. support both `hive-jdbc` and `spark-jdbc` client for compatibility with most clients\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have done all these works in our repo, now we plan  merge our code into the master step by step.  \r\n\r\n1.  **phase1**  pr about build new module  `spark-service` on folder `sql/service`\r\n2. **phase2**  pr thrift protocol and generated thrift protocol java code \r\n3. **phase3**  pr with all `spark-service` module code  and description about design, also UT\r\n4. **phase4**  pr about build new module `spark-jdbc` on folder `sql/jdbc`\r\n5. **phase5**  pr with all `spark-jdbc` module code  and UT\r\n6. **phase6**  pr about support thriftserver Impersonation\r\n7. **phase7**   pr about build spark's own beeline client `spark-beeline`\r\n8. **phase8**  pr about spark's own Cli client `Spark SQL CLI` `spark-cli`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nBuild a totally new thrift server base on spark's own code

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThere is a deadlock between `LiveListenerBus#stop` and `AsyncEventQueue#removeListenerOnError`.\r\n\r\nWe can reproduce as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Post some events to `LiveListenerBus`\r\n2. Call `LiveListenerBus#stop` and hold the synchronized lock of `bus`(https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/5e92301723464d0876b5a7eec59c15fed0c5b98c/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/scheduler/LiveListenerBus.scala#L229), waiting until all the events are processed by listeners, then remove all the queues\r\n3. Event queue would drain out events by posting to its listeners. If a listener is interrupted, it will call `AsyncEventQueue#removeListenerOnError`,  inside it will call `bus.removeListener`(https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/7b1b60c7583faca70aeab2659f06d4e491efa5c0/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/scheduler/AsyncEventQueue.scala#L207), trying to acquire synchronized lock of bus, resulting in deadlock\r\n\r\nThis PR  removes the `synchronized` from `LiveListenerBus.stop` because underlying data structures themselves are thread-safe.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo fix deadlock.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nUpdate CREATE VIEW command to store the current catalog and namespace instead of current database in view metadata. Also update analyzer to leverage the catalog and namespace in view metastore to resolve relations inside views.\r\n\r\nNote that, this PR still keeps the way we resolve views, by recursively calling Analyzer. This is necessary because view text may contain CTE, window spec, etc. which needs rules outside of the main resolution batch (e.g. `CTESubstitution`)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo resolve relations inside view correctly.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, fix a bug. Now tables referred by a view can be resolved correctly even if the current catalog/namespace has been updated.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\na new

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch renews the verification logic of archive path for FileStreamSource, as we found the logic doesn't take partitioned/recursive options into account.\r\n\r\nBefore the patch, it only requires the archive path to have depth more than 2 (two subdirectories from root), leveraging the fact FileStreamSource normally reads the files where the parent directory matches the pattern or the file itself matches the pattern. Given 'archive' operation moves the files to the base archive path with retaining the full path, archive path is tend to be safe if the depth is more than 2, meaning FileStreamSource doesn't re-read archived files as new source files.\r\n\r\nWIth partitioned/recursive options, the fact is invalid, as FileStreamSource can read any files in any depth of subdirectories for source pattern. To deal with this correctly, we have to renew the verification logic, which may not intuitive and simple but works for all cases.\r\n\r\nThe new verification logic prevents both cases:\r\n\r\n1) archive path matches with source pattern as \"prefix\" (the depth of archive path > the depth of source pattern)\r\n\r\ne.g.\r\n* source pattern: `/hello*/spar?`\r\n* archive path: `/hello/spark/structured/streaming`\r\n\r\nAny files in archive path will match with source pattern when recursive option is enabled.\r\n\r\n2) source pattern matches with archive path as \"prefix\" (the depth of source pattern > the depth of archive path)\r\n\r\ne.g.\r\n* source pattern: `/hello*/spar?/structured/hello2*`\r\n* archive path: `/hello/spark/structured`\r\n\r\nSome archive files will not match with source pattern, e.g. file path:  `/hello/spark/structured/hello2`, then final archived path: `/hello/spark/structured/hello/spark/structured/hello2`.\r\n\r\nBut some other archive files will still match with source pattern, e.g. file path: `/hello2/spark/structured/hello2`, then final archived path: `/hello/spark/structured/hello2/spark/structured/hello2` which matches with source pattern when recursive is enabled.\r\n\r\nImplicitly it also prevents archive path matches with source pattern as full match (same depth).\r\n\r\nWe would want to prevent any source files to be archived and added to new source files again, so the patch takes most restrictive approach to prevent the possible cases.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWithout this patch, there's a chance archived files are included as new source files when partitioned/recursive option is enabled, as current condition doesn't take these options into account.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nOnly for Spark 3.0.0-preview (only preview 1 for now, but possibly preview 2 as well) - end users are required to provide archive path with ensuring a bit complicated conditions, instead of simply higher than 2 depths.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew UT.","created_at":"2019-12-17T06:42:08Z","updated_at":"2020-01-08T23:23:54Z","closed_at":"2020-01-08T17:16:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"68ecf94f609cf94bf8ebd0de74e24a558d21841c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26920/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26920/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26920/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/be988dfe396ac087295f8d39dc9eaeb6a2143465","head":{"label":"HeartSaVioR:SPARK-30281","ref":"SPARK-30281","sha":"be988dfe396ac087295f8d39dc9eaeb6a2143465","user":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":27994296,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzk5NDI5Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"HeartSaVioR/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR/spark","description":"Mirror

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis pr intends to support 32 or more grouping attributes for GROUPING_ID. In the current master, an integer overflow can occur to compute grouping IDs;\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/e75d9afb2f282ce79c9fd8bce031287739326a4f/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/plans/logical/basicLogicalOperators.scala#L613\r\n\r\nFor example, the query below generates wrong grouping IDs in the master;\r\n```\r\n\r\nscala> val numCols = 32 // or, 31\r\nscala> val cols = (0 until numCols).map { i => s\"c$i\" }\r\nscala> sql(s\"create table test_$numCols (${cols.map(c => s\"$c int\").mkString(\",\")}, v int) using parquet\")\r\nscala> val insertVals = (0 until numCols).map { _ => 1 }.mkString(\",\")\r\nscala> sql(s\"insert into test_$numCols values ($insertVals,3)\")\r\nscala> sql(s\"select grouping_id(), sum(v) from test_$numCols group by grouping sets ((${cols.mkString(\",\")}), (${cols.init.mkString(\",\")}))\").show(10, false)\r\nscala> sql(s\"drop table test_$numCols\")\r\n\r\n// numCols = 32\r\n+-------------+------+\r\n|grouping_id()|sum(v)|\r\n+-------------+------+\r\n|0            |3     |\r\n|0            |3     | // Wrong Grouping ID\r\n+-------------+------+\r\n\r\n// numCols = 31\r\n+-------------+------+\r\n|grouping_id()|sum(v)|\r\n+-------------+------+\r\n|0            |3     |\r\n|1            |3     |\r\n+-------------+------+\r\n```\r\nTo fix this issue, this pr change code to use long values for `GROUPING_ID` instead of int values.\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo support more cases in `GROUPING_ID`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWe should not append keys to BytesToBytesMap to be its max capacity.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nBytesToBytesMap.append allows to append keys until the number of keys reaches MAX_CAPACITY. But once the the pointer array in the map holds MAX_CAPACITY keys, next time call of lookup will hang forever.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces `SupportsCatalogOptions` as an interface for `TableProvider`. Through `SupportsCatalogOptions`, V2 DataSources can implement the two methods `extractIdentifier` and `extractCatalog` to support the creation, and existence check of tables without requiring a formal TableCatalog implementation. \r\n\r\nWe currently don't support all SaveModes for DataSourceV2 in DataFrameWriter.save. The idea here is that eventually File based tables can be written with `DataFrameWriter.save(path)` will create a PathIdentifier where the name is `path`, and the V2SessionCatalog will be able to perform FileSystem checks at `path` to support ErrorIfExists and Ignore SaveModes.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo support all Save modes for V2 data sources with DataFrameWriter. Since we can now support table creation, we will be able to provide partitioning information when first creating the table as well.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nIntroduces a new interface\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nWill add tests once interface is

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nRemove usages of Guava that no longer work in Guava 27, and replace with workalikes. I'll comment on key types of changes below.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nHadoop 3.2.1 uses Guava 27, so this helps us avoid problems running on Hadoop 3.2.1+ and generally lowers our exposure to Guava.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nShould not be, but see notes below on hash codes and toString.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests will verify whether these changes break anything for Guava 14.\r\nI manually built with an updated version and it compiles with Guava 27; tests running manually locally

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nPySpark UDF to convert MLlib vectors to dense arrays.\r\nExample:\r\n```\r\nfrom pyspark.ml.functions import vector_to_array\r\ndf.select(vector_to_array(col(\"features\"))\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIf a PySpark user wants to convert MLlib sparse/dense vectors in a DataFrame into dense arrays, an efficient approach is to do that in JVM. However, it requires PySpark user to write Scala code and register it as a UDF. Often this is infeasible for a pure python project.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis is an alternative solution to https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/25095. \r\nSQLMetrics use -1 as init value as a work around for [SPARK-11013](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-11013.) However, it may bring out some badcases as https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/26726 reporting. In fact, we only need to reserve -1 when doing min max statistics in `SQLMetrics.stringValue` so that we can filter out those not initialized accumulators. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR mainly targets:\r\n\r\n1. Expose only explain(mode: String) in Scala side\r\n2. Clean up related codes\r\n    - Hide `ExplainMode` under private `execution` package. No particular reason but just because `ExplainUtils` exists there\r\n    - Use `case object` + `trait` pattern in `ExplainMode` to look after `ParseMode`.\r\n    -  Move `Dataset.toExplainString` to `QueryExecution.explainString` to look after `QueryExecution.simpleString`, and deduplicate the codes at `ExplainCommand`.\r\n    - Use `ExplainMode` in `ExplainCommand` too.\r\n    - Add `explainString` to `PythonSQLUtils` to avoid unexpected test failure of PySpark during refactoring Scala codes side.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo minimised exposed APIs, deduplicate, and clean up.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\n`Dataset.explain(mode: ExplainMode)` will be removed (which only exists in master).\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested and existing tests should cover.","created_at":"2019-12-15T11:38:09Z","updated_at":"2020-03-03T01:17:07Z","closed_at":"2019-12-16T05:43:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b27c17e13d5bceaeb32024134f8751c80ee19059","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"maropu","id":692303,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MjMwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/692303?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu","html_url":"https://github.com/maropu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26898/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26898/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26898/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/48789561900c7124a7ac5485f946aeae7e224fc9","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-30200-followup","ref":"SPARK-30200-followup","sha":"48789561900c7124a7ac5485f946aeae7e224fc9","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark"

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen querying a partitioned table with format `org.apache.hive.hcatalog.data.JsonSerDe` and more than one task runs in each executor concurrently, the following exception is encountered:\r\n\r\n`java.lang.ClassCastException: java.util.ArrayList cannot be cast to org.apache.hive.hcatalog.data.HCatRecord`\r\n\r\nThe exception occurs in `HadoopTableReader.fillObject`.\r\n\r\n`org.apache.hive.hcatalog.data.JsonSerDe#initialize` populates a `cachedObjectInspector` field by calling `HCatRecordObjectInspectorFactory.getHCatRecordObjectInspector`, which is not thread-safe; this `cachedObjectInspector` is returned by `JsonSerDe#getObjectInspector`.\r\n\r\nWe protect against this Hive bug by synchronizing on an object when we need to call `initialize` on `org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.Deserializer` instances (which may be `JsonSerDe` instances). By doing so, the `ObjectInspector` for the `Deserializer` of the partitions of the JSON table and that of the table `SerDe` are the same cached `ObjectInspector` and `HadoopTableReader.fillObject` then works correctly. (If the `ObjectInspector`s are different, then a bug in `HCatRecordObjectInspector` causes an `ArrayList` to be created instead of an `HCatRecord`, resulting in the `ClassCastException` that is seen.)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo avoid HIVE-15773 / HIVE-21752.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTested manually on a cluster with a partitioned JSON table and running a query using more than one core per executor. Before this change, the ClassCastException happens consistently. With this change it does not happen.\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-15T02:01:57Z","updated_at":"2023-05-23T06:42:39Z","closed_at":"2019-12-20T18:39:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"09c1ceef0d1274ca9d05d7aa95905709d3727227","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26895/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26895/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26895/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2d23e43ac823ce0562c480071a656d099b2c32b9","head":{"label":"wypoon:SPARK-17398","ref":"SPARK-17398","sha":"2d23e43ac823ce0562c480071a656d099b2c32b9","user":{"login":"wypoon","id":3925490,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MjU0OTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3925490?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon","html_url":"https://github.com/wypoon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":108919243,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDg5MTkyNDM=","name":"spark","full_name":"wypoon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wypoon","id":3925490,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MjU0OTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3925490?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon","html_url":"https://github.com/wypoon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wypoon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wypoon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR applies the current namespace for the single-part table name if the current catalog is a non-session catalog.\r\n\r\nNote that the reason the current namespace is not applied for the session catalog is that the single-part name could be referencing a temp view which doesn't belong to any namespaces. The empty namespace for a table inside the session catalog is resolved by the session catalog implementation.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIt's fixing the following bug where the current namespace is not respected:\r\n```\r\nsql(\"CREATE TABLE testcat.ns.t USING foo AS SELECT 1 AS id\")\r\nsql(\"USE testcat.ns\")\r\nsql(\"SHOW CURRENT NAMESPACE\").show\r\n+-------+---------+\r\n|catalog|namespace|\r\n+-------+---------+\r\n|testcat|       ns|\r\n+-------+---------+\r\n\r\n// `t` is not resolved since the current namespace `ns` is not used.\r\nsql(\"DESCRIBE t\").show\r\nFailed to analyze query: org.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: Table not found: t;;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, the above `DESCRIBE` command will succeed.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWe could get the Partitions Statistics Info.But in some specail case, The Info  like  totalSize，rawDataSize，rowCount maybe empty. When we do some ddls like   \r\n`desc formatted partition` ,the NumberFormatException is showed as below:\r\n```\r\nspark-sql> desc formatted table1 partition(year='2019', month='10', day='17', hour='23');\r\n19/10/19 00:02:40 ERROR SparkSQLDriver: Failed in [desc formatted table1 partition(year='2019', month='10', day='17', hour='23')]\r\njava.lang.NumberFormatException: Zero length BigInteger\r\nat java.math.BigInteger.(BigInteger.java:411)\r\nat java.math.BigInteger.(BigInteger.java:597)\r\nat scala.math.BigInt$.apply(BigInt.scala:77)\r\nat org.apache.spark.sql.hive.client.HiveClientImpl$$anonfun$31.apply(HiveClientImpl.scala:1056)\r\n```\r\nAlthough we can use 'Analyze table partition ' to update the totalSize,rawDataSize or rowCount, it's unresonable for normal SQL to throw NumberFormatException for Empty totalSize.We should fix the empty case when readHiveStats.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a related to the robustness of the code and may lead to unexpected exception in some unpredictable situation.Here is the case:\r\n<img width=\"981\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20614350/70845771-7b88b400-1e8d-11ea-95b0-df5c58097d7d.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdd CreateFunctionStatement and make CREATE FUNCTION go through the same catalog/table resolution framework of v2 commands.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIt's important to make all the commands have the same table resolution behavior, to avoid confusing\r\nCREATE FUNCTION namespace.function\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. When running CREATE FUNCTION namespace.function Spark fails the command if the current catalog is set to a v2 catalog.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nUnit tests.","created_at":"2019-12-14T08:01:44Z","updated_at":"2020-01-07T16:38:42Z","closed_at":"2020-01-07T16:38:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"381957ae372f489805d214d4f6066a2d682b8926","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26890/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26890/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26890/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d9eb4410d5c77234746d13132f3cad5aa6092d1d","head":{"label":"planga82:feature/SPARK-30039_CreateFunctionV2Command","ref":"feature/SPARK-30039_CreateFunctionV2Command","sha":"d9eb4410d5c77234746d13132f3cad5aa6092d1d","user":{"login":"planga82","id":12819544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODE5NTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12819544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82","html_url":"https://github.com/planga82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":182507758,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODI1MDc3NTg=","name":"sparkFork","full_name":"planga82/sparkFork","private":false,"owner":{"login":"planga82","id":12819544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODE5NTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12819544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82","html_url":"https://github.com/planga82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/planga82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/planga82/sparkFork","description":"Apache

And in fact, the owner should not changed for the real prodcution environment, otherwise the  authority check is out of order.\r\n\r\nThe problem can be reproduced as described in the below:\r\n1. First I create a table with username='xie' and then `desc formatted table `,the owner is 'xiepengjie'\r\n```\r\nspark-sql> desc formatted bigdata_test.tt1;\r\ncol_name data_type comment\r\nc int NULL\r\n# Detailed Table Information\r\nDatabase bigdata_test\r\nTable tt1\r\nOwner xie\r\nCreated Time Wed Sep 11 11:30:49 CST 2019\r\nLast Access Thu Jan 01 08:00:00 CST 1970\r\nCreated By Spark 2.2 or prior\r\nType MANAGED\r\nProvider hive\r\nTable Properties [PART_LIMIT=10000, transient_lastDdlTime=1568172649, LEVEL=1, TTL=60]\r\nLocation hdfs://NS1/user/hive_admin/warehouse/bigdata_test.db/tt1\r\nSerde Library org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.orc.OrcSerde\r\nInputFormat org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.orc.OrcInputFormat\r\nOutputFormat org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.orc.OrcOutputFormat\r\nStorage Properties [serialization.format=1]\r\nPartition Provider Catalog\r\nTime taken: 0.371 seconds, Fetched 18 row(s)\r\n\r\n```\r\n2. Then I use another username='johnchen' and execute `alter table bigdata_test.tt1 set location 'hdfs://NS1/user/hive_admin/warehouse/bigdata_test.db/tt1'`, check the owner of hive table  is 'johnchen', it's unresonable\r\n```\r\nspark-sql> desc formatted bigdata_test.tt1;\r\ncol_name        data_type       comment\r\nc       int     NULL\r\n \r\n# Detailed Table Information\r\nDatabase        bigdata_test\r\nTable   tt1\r\nOwner   johnchen\r\nCreated Time    Wed Sep 11 11:30:49 CST 2019\r\nLast Access     Thu Jan 01 08:00:00 CST 1970\r\nCreated By      Spark 2.2 or prior\r\nType    MANAGED\r\nProvider        hive\r\nTable Properties        [transient_lastDdlTime=1568871017, PART_LIMIT=10000, LEVEL=1, TTL=60]\r\nLocation        hdfs://NS1/user/hive_admin/warehouse/bigdata_test.db/tt1\r\nSerde Library   org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.orc.OrcSerde\r\nInputFormat     org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.orc.OrcInputFormat\r\nOutputFormat    org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.orc.OrcOutputFormat\r\nStorage Properties      [serialization.format=1]\r\nPartition Provider      Catalog\r\nTime taken: 0.041 seconds, Fetched 18 row(s)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

But for the other statements it failed to load jar to current classpath and would throw ClassNotFoundException.It seems like that  the first  ClassLoader is different from the other's. For Spark-shell, the maintained class loader is always IMainsTranslatingClassLoader ,and for addJar Operation, the current classLoader is NonClosableMutuableclassLoader.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFix bug : CREATE TABLE throw error when session catalog specified explicitly.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, Spark throw error when the session catalog is specified explicitly in \"CREATE TABLE\" and \"CREATE TABLE AS SELECT\" command, eg. \r\n> CREATE TABLE spark_catalog.tbl USING json AS SELECT 1 AS i;\r\n\r\nthe error message is like below: \r\n> 19/12/14 10:56:08 INFO HiveMetaStore: 0: get_table : db=spark_catalog tbl=tbl\r\n> 19/12/14 10:56:08 INFO audit: ugi=fuwhu ip=unknown-ip-addr      cmd=get_table :

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to move all tests that use deprecated Spark APIs to separate test classes, and add the annotation:\r\n```scala\r\n@deprecated(\"This test suite will be removed.\", \"3.0.0\")\r\n```\r\nThe annotation suppress warnings from already deprecated methods and classes.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe warnings about deprecated Spark APIs in tests does not indicate any issues because the tests use such APIs intentionally. Eliminating the warnings allows to highlight other warnings that could show real problems.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy existing test suites and by \r\n- DeprecatedAvroFunctionsSuite\r\n- DeprecatedDateFunctionsSuite\r\n- DeprecatedDatasetAggregatorSuite\r\n- DeprecatedStreamingAggregationSuite\r\n-

And this PR brings two behavior changes:\r\n\r\n1) for literals like `1.23E4BD` or `1.23E4`(with `spark.sql.legacy.exponentLiteralAsDecimal.enabled`=true, see [SPARK-29956](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-29956)), we set its `(precision, scale)` to (5, 0) rather than (3, -2);\r\n2) add negative `scale` check inside the decimal method if it exposes to set `scale` explicitly. If check fails, `AnalysisException` throws. \r\n\r\nAnd user could still use `spark.sql.legacy.allowNegativeScaleOfDecimal.enabled` to restore the previous behavior.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAccording to SQL standard,\r\n> 4.4.2 Characteristics of numbers\r\nAn exact numeric type has a precision P and a scale S. P is a positive integer that determines the number of significant digits in a particular radix R, where R is either 2 or 10. S is a non-negative integer.\r\n\r\nscale of Decimal should always be non-negative. And other mainstream databases, like Presto, PostgreSQL, also don't allow negative scale.\r\n\r\nPresto:\r\n```\r\npresto:default> create table t (i decimal(2, -1));\r\nQuery 20191213_081238_00017_i448h failed: line 1:30: mismatched input '-'. Expecting: <integer>, <type>\r\ncreate table t (i decimal(2, -1))\r\n```\r\n\r\nPostgrelSQL:\r\n```\r\npostgres=# create table t(i decimal(2, -1));\r\nERROR:  NUMERIC scale -1 must be between 0 and precision 2\r\nLINE 1: create table t(i decimal(2, -1));\r\n                         ^\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd, actually, Spark itself already doesn't allow to create table with negative decimal types using SQL:\r\n```\r\nscala> spark.sql(\"create table t(i decimal(2, -1))\");\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.parser.ParseException:\r\nno viable alternative at input 'create table t(i decimal(2, -'(line 1, pos 28)\r\n\r\n== SQL ==\r\ncreate table t(i decimal(2, -1))\r\n----------------------------^^^\r\n\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.parser.ParseException.withCommand(ParseDriver.scala:263)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.parser.AbstractSqlParser.parse(ParseDriver.scala:130)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.SparkSqlParser.parse(SparkSqlParser.scala:48)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.parser.AbstractSqlParser.parsePlan(ParseDriver.scala:76)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession.$anonfun$sql$1(SparkSession.scala:605)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.QueryPlanningTracker.measurePhase(QueryPlanningTracker.scala:111)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession.sql(SparkSession.scala:605)\r\n  ... 35 elided\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, it is still possible to create such table or `DatFrame` using Spark SQL programming API:\r\n```\r\nscala> val tb =\r\n CatalogTable(\r\n  TableIdentifier(\"test\", None),\r\n  CatalogTableType.MANAGED, \r\n  CatalogStorageFormat.empty, \r\n  StructType(StructField(\"i\", DecimalType(2, -1) ) :: Nil))\r\n```\r\n```\r\nscala> spark.sql(\"SELECT 1.23E4BD\")\r\nres2: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [1.23E+4: decimal(3,-2)]\r\n```\r\nwhile, these two different behavior could make user confused.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the other side, even if user creates such table or `DataFrame` with negative scale decimal type, it can't write data out if using format, like `parquet` or `orc`. Because these formats have their own check for negative scale and fail on it.\r\n```\r\nscala> spark.sql(\"SELECT 1.23E4BD\").write.saveAsTable(\"parquet\")\r\n19/12/13 17:37:04 ERROR Executor: Exception in task 0.0 in stage 0.0 (TID 0)\r\njava.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Invalid DECIMAL scale: -2\r\n\tat org.apache.parquet.Preconditions.checkArgument(Preconditions.java:53)\r\n\tat org.apache.parquet.schema.Types$BasePrimitiveBuilder.decimalMetadata(Types.java:495)\r\n\tat org.apache.parquet.schema.Types$BasePrimitiveBuilder.build(Types.java:403)\r\n\tat org.apache.parquet.schema.Types$BasePrimitiveBuilder.build(Types.java:309)\r\n\tat org.apache.parquet.schema.Types$Builder.named(Types.java:290)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.parquet.SparkToParquetSchemaConverter.convertField(ParquetSchemaConverter.scala:428)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.parquet.SparkToParquetSchemaConverter.convertField(ParquetSchemaConverter.scala:334)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.parquet.SparkToParquetSchemaConverter.$anonfun$convert$2(ParquetSchemaConverter.scala:326)\r\n\tat scala.collection.TraversableLike.$anonfun$map$1(TraversableLike.scala:238)\r\n\tat scala.collection.Iterator.foreach(Iterator.scala:941)\r\n\tat scala.collection.Iterator.foreach$(Iterator.scala:941)\r\n\tat scala.collection.AbstractIterator.foreach(Iterator.scala:1429)\r\n\tat scala.collection.IterableLike.foreach(IterableLike.scala:74)\r\n\tat scala.collection.IterableLike.foreach$(IterableLike.scala:73)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.types.StructType.foreach(StructType.scala:99)\r\n\tat scala.collection.TraversableLike.map(TraversableLike.scala:238)\r\n\tat scala.collection.TraversableLike.map$(TraversableLike.scala:231)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.types.StructType.map(StructType.scala:99)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.parquet.SparkToParquetSchemaConverter.convert(ParquetSchemaConverter.scala:326)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.parquet.ParquetWriteSupport.init(ParquetWriteSupport.scala:97)\r\n\tat org.apache.parquet.hadoop.ParquetOutputFormat.getRecordWriter(ParquetOutputFormat.java:388)\r\n\tat org.apache.parquet.hadoop.ParquetOutputFormat.getRecordWriter(ParquetOutputFormat.java:349)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.parquet.ParquetOutputWriter.<init>(ParquetOutputWriter.scala:37)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.parquet.ParquetFileFormat$$anon$1.newInstance(ParquetFileFormat.scala:150)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.SingleDirectoryDataWriter.newOutputWriter(FileFormatDataWriter.scala:124)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.SingleDirectoryDataWriter.<init>(FileFormatDataWriter.scala:109)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.FileFormatWriter$.executeTask(FileFormatWriter.scala:264)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.FileFormatWriter$.$anonfun$write$15(FileFormatWriter.scala:205)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.scheduler.ResultTask.runTask(ResultTask.scala:90)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.scheduler.Task.run(Task.scala:127)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.executor.Executor$TaskRunner.$anonfun$run$3(Executor.scala:441)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.util.Utils$.tryWithSafeFinally(Utils.scala:1377)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.executor.Executor$TaskRunner.run(Executor.scala:444)\r\n\tat java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1149)\r\n\tat java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:624)\r\n\tat java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:748)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, I think it would be better to disallow negative scale totally and make behaviors above be consistent.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, if `spark.sql.legacy.allowNegativeScaleOfDecimal.enabled=false`, user couldn't create Decimal value with negative scale anymore.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIf a table name is qualified with session catalog name `spark_catalog`, the `DROP TABLE` command fails.\r\n\r\nFor example, the following\r\n\r\n```\r\nsql(\"CREATE TABLE tbl USING json AS SELECT 1 AS i\")\r\nsql(\"DROP TABLE spark_catalog.tbl\")\r\n```\r\nfails with:\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.analysis.NoSuchDatabaseException: Database 'spark_catalog' not found;\r\n   at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.catalog.ExternalCatalog.requireDbExists(ExternalCatalog.scala:42)\r\n   at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.catalog.ExternalCatalog.requireDbExists$(ExternalCatalog.scala:40)\r\n   at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.catalog.InMemoryCatalog.requireDbExists(InMemoryCatalog.scala:45)\r\n   at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.catalog.InMemoryCatalog.tableExists(InMemoryCatalog.scala:336)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR correctly resolves `spark_catalog` as a catalog.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIt's fixing a bug.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, now, the `spark_catalog.tbl` in the above example is dropped as expected.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe PR adds a new config option to configure an address for the\r\nproxy server, and a new handler that intercepts redirects and replaces\r\nthe URL with one pointing at the proxy server. This is needed on top\r\nof the \"proxy base path\" support because redirects use full URLs, not\r\njust absolute paths from the server's root.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSpark's web UI has support for generating links to paths with a\r\nprefix, to support a proxy server, but those do not apply when\r\nthe UI is responding with redirects. In that case, Spark is sending\r\nits own URL back to the client, and if it's behind a dumb proxy\r\nserver that doesn't do rewriting (like when using stunnel for HTTPS\r\nsupport) then the client will see the wrong URL and may fail.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe target tables of DELETE/UPDATE/MERGE should not be children of the nodes. They should simply be variables of the node.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nHaving the targets as children can cause bad interactions with other catalyst rules that may want to perform actions assuming a child is a \"read-only\" relation. This change also makes these commands more consistent with AlterTable and DescribeTable.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nCheck the partition column data type and only allow string and integral types in hive partition pruning. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently we only support string and integral types in hive partition pruning, but the check is done for literals. If the predicate is `InSet`, then there is no literal and we may pass an unsupported partition predicate to Hive and cause problems.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nyes. fix a bug. A query fails before and can run now.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\na new

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen `spark.shuffle.useOldFetchProtocol` is enabled then switching off the direct disk reading of host-local shuffle blocks and falling back to remote block fetching (and this way avoiding the `GetLocalDirsForExecutors` block transfer message which is introduced from Spark 3.0.0).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn `[SPARK-27651][Core] Avoid the network when shuffle blocks are fetched from the same host` a new block transfer message is introduced, `GetLocalDirsForExecutors`. This new message could be sent to the external shuffle service and as it is not supported by the previous version of external shuffle service it should be avoided when `spark.shuffle.useOldFetchProtocol` is true.\r\n\r\nIn the migration guide I changed the exception type as `org.apache.spark.network.shuffle.protocol.BlockTransferMessage.Decoder#fromByteBuffer`\r\nthrows a IllegalArgumentException with the given text and uses the message type which is just a simple number (byte). I have checked and this is true for version 2.4.4 too.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis specific case (considering one extra boolean to switch off host local disk reading feature) is not tested but existing tests were run.","created_at":"2019-12-12T17:56:41Z","updated_at":"2019-12-17T18:33:06Z","closed_at":"2019-12-17T18:33:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"dd5dfba710de8db2c5c099adee8cda64df6139fe","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nNow users can add directories from sql CLI as well using ADD FILE command and setting spark.sql.addDirectory.recursive to true.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn SPARK-4687, support was added for adding directories as resources. But sql users cannot use that feature from CLI. \r\n\r\n`ADD FILE /path/to/folder` gives the following error:\r\n`org.apache.spark.SparkException: Added file /path/to/folder is a directory and recursive is not turned on.`\r\n\r\nUsers need to turn on `recursive` for adding directories. Thus a configuration was required which will allow users to turn on `recursive`. \r\nAlso Hive allow users to add directories from their shell.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes. Users can set recursive using `spark.sql.addDirectory.recursive`.\r\n<!--\r\n```\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManually.\r\nWill add test cases soon.\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n SPARK SCREENSHOTS\r\nWhen `spark.sql.addDirectory.recursive` is not turned on.\r\n![Screenshot from 2019-12-13

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch adds close() method to the DataWriter interface, which will become the place to cleanup the resource.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe lifecycle of DataWriter instance ends at either commit() or abort(). That makes datasource implementors to feel they can place resource cleanup in both sides, but abort() can be called when commit() fails; so they have to ensure they don't do double-cleanup if cleanup is not idempotent.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nDepends on the definition of user; if they're developers of custom DSv2 source, they have to add close() in their DataWriter implementations. It's OK to just add close() with empty content as they should have already dealt with resource cleanup in commit/abort, but they would love to migrate the resource cleanup logic to close() as it avoids double cleanup. If they're just end users using the provided DSv2 source (regardless of built-in/3rd party), no change.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests.","created_at":"2019-12-12T01:51:39Z","updated_at":"2019-12-13T10:16:48Z","closed_at":"2019-12-13T08:12:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"dcb0326694f9392887b5521684af49e22b338e35","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdd DropFunctionStatement and make DROP FUNCTION go through the same catalog/table resolution framework of v2 commands.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIt's important to make all the commands have the same table resolution behavior, to avoid confusing\r\nDROP FUNCTION namespace.function\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. When running DROP FUNCTION namespace.function Spark fails the command if the current catalog is set to a v2 catalog.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes the availability of `minPartitions` option for Kafka source, as it is only supported by micro-batch for now. There's a WIP PR for batch (#25436) as well but there's no progress on the PR so far, so safer to fix the doc first, and let it be added later when we address it with batch case as well.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe doc is wrong and misleading.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nJust a doc

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, we have a v2 adapter for v1 catalog (`V2SessionCatalog`), all the table/namespace commands can be implemented via v2 APIs.\r\n\r\nUsually, a command needs to know which catalog it needs to operate, but different commands have different requirements about what to resolve. A few examples:\r\n\r\n  - `DROP NAMESPACE`: only need to know the name of the namespace.\r\n  - `DESC NAMESPACE`: need to lookup the namespace and get metadata, but is done during execution\r\n  - `DROP TABLE`: need to do lookup and make sure it's a table not (temp) view.\r\n  - `DESC TABLE`: need to lookup the table and get metadata.\r\n\r\nFor namespaces, the analyzer only needs to find the catalog and the namespace name. The command can do lookup during execution if needed. \r\n\r\nFor tables, mostly commands need the analyzer to do lookup.\r\n\r\nNote that, table and namespace have a difference: `DESC NAMESPACE testcat` works and describes the root namespace under `testcat`, while `DESC TABLE testcat` fails if there is no table `testcat` under the current catalog. It's because namespaces can be named [], but tables can't. The commands should explicitly specify it needs to operate on namespace or table.\r\n\r\nIn this Pull Request, we introduce a new framework to resolve v2 commands:\r\n1. parser creates logical plans or commands with `UnresolvedNamespace`/`UnresolvedTable`/`UnresolvedView`/`UnresolvedRelation`. (CREATE TABLE still keeps Seq[String], as it doesn't need to look up relations)\r\n2. analyzer converts\r\n2.1 `UnresolvedNamespace` to `ResolvesNamespace` (contains catalog and namespace identifier)\r\n2.2 `UnresolvedTable` to `ResolvedTable` (contains catalog, identifier and `Table`)\r\n2.3 `UnresolvedView` to `ResolvedView` (will be added later when we migrate view commands)\r\n2.4 `UnresolvedRelation` to relation.\r\n3. an extra analyzer rule to match commands with `V1Table` and converts them to corresponding v1 commands. This will be added later when we migrate existing commands\r\n4. planner matches commands and converts them to the corresponding physical nodes.\r\n\r\nWe also introduce brand new v2 commands - the `comment` syntaxes to illustrate how to work with the newly added framework.\r\n```sql\r\nCOMMENT ON (DATABASE|SCHEMA|NAMESPACE) ... IS ...\r\nCOMMENT ON TABLE ... IS ...\r\n```\r\nDetails about the `comment` syntaxes:\r\nAs the new design of catalog v2, some properties become reserved, e.g. `location`, `comment`. We are going to disable setting reserved properties by dbproperties or tblproperites directly to avoid confliction with their related subClause or specific commands. \r\n\r\nThey are the best practices from PostgreSQL and presto.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/sql-comment.html\r\nhttps://prestosql.io/docs/current/sql/comment.html\r\n\r\nMostly, the basic thoughts of the new framework came from the discussions bellow with @cloud-fan,  https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/26847#issuecomment-564510061,   \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo make it easier to add new v2 commands, and easier to unify the table relation behavior.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nyes, add new syntax\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nadd

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch revises Kafka producer pool (cache) to implement 'expire' correctly.\r\n\r\nCurrent implementation of Kafka producer cache leverages Guava cache, which decides cached producer instance to be expired if the instance is not \"accessed\" from cache. The behavior defines expiration time as \"last accessed time + timeout\", which is incorrect because some task may use the instance longer than timeout. There's no concept of \"returning\" in Guava cache as well, so it cannot be fixed with Guava cache.\r\n\r\nThis patch introduces a new pool implementation which tracks \"reference count\" of cached instance, and defines expiration time for the instance as \"last returned time + timeout\" if the reference count goes 0, otherwise Long.MaxValue (effectively no expire). Expiring instances will be done with evict thread explicitly instead of evicting in part of handling acquire. (It might bring more overhead, but it ensures clearing expired instances even the pool is idle.)\r\n\r\nThis patch also creates a new package `producer` under `kafka010`, to hide the details from `kafka010` package. In point of `kafka010` package's view, only acquire()/release()/reset() are available in pool, and even for CachedKafkaProducer the package cannot close the producer directly.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nExplained above.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, but only for the way of expiring cached instances. (The difference is described above.) Each executor leveraging spark-sql-kafka would have one eviction thread.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew and existing UTs.","created_at":"2019-12-11T04:47:58Z","updated_at":"2020-01-09T08:07:28Z","closed_at":"2019-12-23T22:20:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4d6d334eea9f64e7e1c35e6232980d4530325bd0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED
