That is due the fact that the expanded task is triggered immediately, while the expanded parameters from the upstream are undefined - what will always result in the immediate failure of the task (`upstream_failure`).\r\nI'm not entirely sure what the purpose of the original issue was by putting an \"ALWAYS\" task within a dynamic task group (they mentioned using a \"watcher\" pattern). However, I think that for now it makes sense to assume that upon an expension of a task - its expanded parameter(s) should be well-defined. \r\nIf at some point we find a good reason to make this definition more flexible - I'm up to it, but at the current implementation it's rather a misuse that we should prevent.\r\n\r\nI will cherry-pick into `v2-10-test` upon approval.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--

The insert_rows method behaves as before if the parameter isn't specified (False by default).  This is one of the patches that will be needed to enhance the GenericTransfer, once this PR is merged I will create a new one for the GenericTransfer operator itself and the SQLExecuteQueryTrigger.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

we moved to Python 3.9 and started usign 3.9+ only features line functools.cache, having Python 3.8 as default python version will result in virtualenvs created with outdated python.\r\n\r\nThis pre-commit checks what is the global version of python3 and it will complain if it is lower than 3.9. This is done via explicit call of \"python3\", because this is what pre-commit does. Also global setting is needed because otherwise new virtualenvs created by pre-commit might be created using lower python version.\r\n\r\n(cherry picked from commit 076da924696dc7d8814a38f442e9ca3eb3e90634)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

Summary\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes a type confusion in the pid file path in the Edge worker.\r\nNow, pid_file_path is explicitly treated as string in the entire implementation of the Edge Worker cli, which interfaces with the lib `lockfile.pidlockfile` for pid file interaction, consuming file path as string only\r\n\r\n## Changes in Detail\r\n\r\n- updated function _write_pid_to_pidfile to consume pid file path as string (as any other function in the module `edge_command`\r\n- converted property `pid_file_path` of class `_EdgeWorkerCli`from `Path` to

the #43260 attempted to address the problem where example dag importability tests should skip provider tests on non-main, it did not actually solve the problem.\r\n\r\nWhile debugging it, it turned out that since #42505, the provider tests were not executed in main \"at all\" - the \"providers\" directory was not included in the list of places to check for the example dags (they were in \"airflow\" in v2-10-test\") this is why it \"looked like\" the solution worked in \"main\".\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes both problems:\r\n\r\n* brings back importability of provider's example_dags in main branch\r\n* properly excludes the providers examples in non-main branch\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

#36930 added constraints to creation of k8s environment, but it had a side effect - the constraints could not be created if source of airflow had dependencies conflicting with constraints (which might happen for example when we upgrade FAB - because locally pinned FAB might be different than the one in constraints).\r\n\r\nAlso the constraints were \"hard-coded\" - the python version, branch and github repository were hard-coded.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes both problems:\r\n\r\n* constraints URL is dynamically generated based on current branch, repo and python version\r\n* in case attempts to create the venv with constraints fails, we attempt to install it again without constraints\r\n\r\n(cherry picked from commit 274b6e1168f84561e8f652a1a4a6fc82aeadc477)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the

plugins _cannot_ be installed by a non-top-level conftest file. Now that provider tests are moved to a nested directory we need to plumb the plugin in a different way.\r\n\r\nThe plugin is now provided on the command line for breeze testing commands.\r\n\r\nAlso the config files which contain exceptions for forbidden_warnings were\r\nset in pytest config in the conftest files. Since the plugin is now loaded at\r\nthe top-level and before conftest files are loaded. Move the config into the\r\npython module for the plugin itself. There should be no harm in\r\nconfiguring all exceptions for each test type. Each discovered test is just checked against the set of exceptions.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

#36930 added constraints to creation of k8s environment, but it had a side effect - the constraints could not be created if source of airflow had dependencies conflicting with constraints (which might happen for example when we upgrade FAB - because locally pinned FAB might be different than the one in constraints).\r\n\r\nAlso the constraints were \"hard-coded\" - the python version, branch and github repository were hard-coded.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes both problems:\r\n\r\n* constraints URL is dynamically generated based on current branch, repo and python version\r\n* in case attempts to create the venv with constraints fails, we attempt to install it again without constraints\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license

the #43260 attempted to address the problem where example dag importability tests should skip provider tests on non-main, it did not actually solve the problem.\r\n\r\nWhile debugging it, it turned out that since #42505, the provider tests were not executed in main \"at all\" - the \"providers\" directory was not included in the list of places to check for the example dags (they were in \"airflow\" in v2-10-test\") this is why it \"looked like\" the solution worked in \"main\".\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes both problems:\r\n\r\n* brings back importability of provider's example_dags in main branch\r\n* properly excludes the providers examples in non-main branch\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

working on this https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/43243, I was following https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/contributing-docs/13_metadata_database_updates.rst and I ran into an error with  pre-commit hook.\r\n\r\nWhen running the revision command as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nroot@f1f78138ad78:/opt/airflow/airflow# alembic revision -m \"New revision\"\r\n  Generating /opt/airflow/airflow/migrations/versions/01b38be821e9_new_revision.py ...  done\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt creates a file as follows:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n\"\"\"New revision\r\n\r\nRevision ID: cd7be1ae8b80\r\nRevises: 05234396c6fc\r\nCreate Date: 2024-10-22 01:44:17.873864\r\n\r\n\"\"\"\r\n\r\nimport sqlalchemy as sa\r\nfrom alembic import op\r\n\r\n# revision identifiers, used by Alembic.\r\nrevision = 'cd7be1ae8b80'\r\ndown_revision = '05234396c6fc'\r\nbranch_labels = None\r\ndepends_on = None\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice single quotes in `revision` & `down_revision`.\r\n\r\nNow if I just run that single pre-commit hook (`update-migration-references`), it fails\r\n\r\n```\r\n❯ pre-commit run \"update-migration-references\" --all-files\r\nUpdate migration ref doc.................................................Failed\r\n- hook id: update-migration-references\r\n- exit code: 1\r\n\r\nUsing 'uv' to install Airflow\r\n\r\nUsing airflow version from current

But rather than doing that, we fix it at source.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/43161 part of [AIP-72](https://github.com/orgs/apache/projects/405).\r\n\r\nAs part of the ongoing work for [AIP-72: Task Execution Interface](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/AIP-72+Task+Execution+Interface+aka+Task+SDK), we are migrating the task_instance table to use a UUID primary key. This change is being made to simplify task instance identification, especially when communicating between the executor and workers.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the primary key of task_instance is a composite key consisting of `dag_id, task_id, run_id, and map_index` as shown below. This migration introduces a **UUID v7** column (`id`) as the new primary key. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/b4269f33c7151e6d61e07333003ec1e219285b07/airflow/models/taskinstance.py#L1815-L1819\r\n\r\n##  Why UUID v7?\r\n\r\nThe UUID v7 format was chosen because of its improved temporal sorting capabilities. For existing records, UUID v7 will be generated using either the queued_dttm, start_date, or the current timestamp.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"792\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba68c9ae-4f9d-4cd2-8504-1b671d23ef6c\">\r\n\r\n(From [this blog post](https://www.toomanyafterthoughts.com/uuids-are-bad-for-database-index-performance-uuid7).)\r\n\r\n## Changes \r\n\r\n1. **Migrated Primary Key to UUID v7**  \r\n   - Replaced the composite primary key (`dag_id`, `task_id`, `run_id`, `map_index`) with a UUID v7 `id` field, ensuring temporal sorting and simplified task instance identification.\r\n\r\n2. **Database-Specific UUID v7 Functions** for DB Migrations  \r\n   - Added UUID v7 functions for each database, just for DB migration since generating uuid's on Python and then storing it in DB can be slow:\r\n      - **PostgreSQL**: Uses `pgcrypto` for generation with fallback.\r\n      - **MySQL**: Custom deterministic UUID v7 function.\r\n      - **SQLite**: Utilizes `uuid6` Python package.\r\n\r\n3. **Updated Constraints and Indexes**  \r\n   - Added `UniqueConstraint` on (`dag_id`, `task_id`, `run_id`, `map_index`) for compatibility.\r\n   - Modified foreign key constraints for the new primary key, handling downgrades to restore previous constraints.\r\n\r\n4. **Model and API Adjustments**  \r\n   - Updated `TaskInstance` model to use UUID v7 as the primary key via [`uuid6`](https://pypi.org/project/uuid6/) library, that has uuid7 ! 😄 .\r\n   - Adjusted REST API, views, and queries to support UUID-based lookups.\r\n   - Modified tests for compatibility with the new primary key.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Issues identified\r\n\r\nAfter updating the primary key on the `TaskInstance` model to a UUID7 `id` field (from the composite primary key of `[\"dag_id\", \"task_id\", \"run_id\", \"map_index\"]`), I have now run into issues  in testing and session management:\r\n\r\n1. **`session.merge()` Compatibility**  \r\n\r\n    The `session.merge()` function operates strictly on primary keys as mentioned in [this SQLAlchemy docs](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/orm/session_state_management.html#merging), which means it no longer recognizes the unique constraint on `[\"dag_id\", \"task_id\", \"run_id\", \"map_index\"]` to identify existing `TaskInstance` records. This leads to issues in cases where `session.merge()` was previously used to either update or insert TaskInstance records, as it now fails to locate the intended record by the unique constraint.\r\n\r\n    Example:\r\n \r\n     https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/b2ecb6c9caacd2ca7a2c1519ca892b19b2bb35fb/tests/models/test_dag.py#L2013-L2026\r\n\r\n    A possible workaround would be to follow `session.merge()` calls with `refresh_from_db()` to ensure the instance has the latest state:  \r\n   ```python\r\n   task_instance_1 = session.merge(TaskInstance(task=t_1, run_id=dagrun_1.run_id, state=ti_state_begin))\r\n   task_instance_1.refresh_from_db()  # Update instance with current DB state\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n\r\n2. **`session.get()` usage with `TaskInstanceKey`**  \r\n\r\n    Similarly, `session.get()` and other primary key-based session operations now rely solely on the `id` UUID rather than the composite fields. This results in errors when accessing or sorting records based on the previous composite fields, as `session.get()` cannot match identifiers to `TaskInstance` records by the unique constraint.\r\n\r\n    **Current code in main**:\r\n\r\n    https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/78ff0a99700125121b7f0647023503750f14a11b/tests/models/test_cleartasks.py#L742\r\n\r\n    I have been changing those references from `TaskInstanceKey` in Database calls with `ti.id`, example:\r\n\r\n   https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/cca7ce0fd66b01293e21221d1dd9332312a4cb66/tests/models/test_cleartasks.py#L742\r\n\r\n3. **Airflow REST API calls which filters TIs**  \r\n    \r\n    Similar to (2) above, some of our REST API call filters TI records based on current primary key as below:\r\n     https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/78ff0a99700125121b7f0647023503750f14a11b/airflow/api_connexion/endpoints/task_instance_endpoint.py#L536-L537\r\n\r\n     I am changing that to `session.scalars(select(TI).where(...))..one_or_none()` queries. For example, the above code is changed to the following in this PR.\r\n     https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/3c61ba7157bce0dd9d7456670e7ba553be046d6e/airflow/api_connexion/endpoints/task_instance_endpoint.py#L536-L540\r\n\r\n## TODOs\r\n\r\n- [x] Check if the DB user has permissions to add CREATE extension for Postgres as we install `pgcrypto`\r\n- [x] Convert the raw SQL for dropping the primary key (CASCADE) into an Alembic operation. This will allow capturing foreign key constraints and managing them in a downgrade scenario. MySQL does not support dropping foreign keys using CASCADE with primary keys anyway.\r\n- [x] Ensure foreign key constraints are re-added during downgrades after the primary key has been changed back to the composite key.\r\n- [x] SQLite Support: Add SQLite support for UUID v7 generation using the [uuid6 Python package](https://pypi.org/project/uuid6/).\r\n- [x] Add changes to `TaskInstance` model file to add `id`\r\n\r\n## Future Work\r\n- [ ] Evaluate if the `task_instance_history` table requires similar updates for UUID v7 compatibility. (https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/43437)\r\n- [ ] **Batch Updates**: Investigate batch processing for updating UUIDs to avoid long locks on large datasets. Maybe run with batches of 10000 rows???  -- TBD. We can also run some benchmarks once we do that. (https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/43438)\r\n- [ ] Determine if including `try_number` in the `UniqueConstraint` improves index efficiency.

is starting on multi-team Airflow, and this project has many dependencies on a auth manager that can support authn and authz and also support the changes to the auth manager api (upcoming). An option for this is Keycloak.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a Breeze integartion for Keycloak which creates a container running keycloak, which uses the existing Postgres container as the DB and disables the requirements for ssl/https/certificates to use the Keycloak admin console (since this is only for development purposes not production).\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.
