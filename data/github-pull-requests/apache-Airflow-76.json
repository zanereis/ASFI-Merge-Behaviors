recent change with splitting the DB from Non-DB tests likely increased a bit pressure on paralell-executing DB tests because they are likely often competing for resources such as DB I/O /networking with other tests running in parallel on the same machine, so the dask executor tests started to (again) timeout.\r\n\r\nIncreasing the timeout might help - if not we will quarantine the tests and try to solve it differently.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

default static checks run in the CI with `--all-files` to make sure that there are no side-effects coming from only running the pre-commit checks on a subset of files. The complete `--all-files` static check suite on self-hosted runners take ~ 9 minutes and for public runners take ~ 15 minutes so there is room for optimisation now that Tests are running faster than that in many cases.\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot run static checks on only the files changed in the PR (that would lead to many false-positives) we can disable whole pre-commit checks in case the incoming PRs do not contain certain files modified. For example we we can skip mypy-providers when no provider files changed, or we can skip mypy-core when no core files changed or we can skip helm linting in case chart files have not changed in the incoming PR.\r\n\r\nThis PR implements selective check rules that will skip some of the longest running pre-commit checks in case it looks like the checks are not needed.\r\n\r\nStill - all tests will be run when \"full tests needed\" flag is set (i.e. when build scripts change or when we detect structural/package changes in the project or when \"full tests needed\" label is set for the PR - and all the static checks will also continue running in \"canary\" builds, so we will be able to catch and correct any rules that will lead to skipping some of the static checks when they should be run in fact.\r\n\r\nAlso the cache for pre-commits is renamed to be \"common\" - currently the \"basic\" cache is different than full cache but since cache is only really uploaded by the \"canary\" builds, it's quite ok to have a common \"full\"cache - it will get faster to retrieve it by regular PRs.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

AIP-50 we introduced trigger forms and such trigger forms allow to provide raw HTML by DAG authors as descriptions.\r\n\r\nDuring Airflow Summit there were some concerns discussed whether a DAG author would be able to inject dangerous JavaScript into the HTML and how Airflow handles this.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the raw HTML support in Airflow in the way:\r\n- A new configuration option `allow_html_in_dag_docs` is added, which defaults to False\r\n- DAG documentation and Params Descriptions allow raw HTML only based on the server config option\r\n- As alternative for safe but still custom text formatting MD is now supported for parameter descriptions\r\n- Markdown also in DAG description is now filtering HTML tags by default\r\n- The `custom_html_form` in trigger DAG UI is marked as deprecated for a future / better solution\r\n- Example DAGs have been adjusted from raw HTML to MD descriptions where used.","created_at":"2023-11-05T17:47:46Z","updated_at":"2024-04-17T21:04:28Z","closed_at":"2023-11-12T18:40:12Z","merged_at":"2023-11-12T18:40:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"0b995602e6e5894ee31625a4dd0e6aa255d2a651","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"pierrejeambrun","id":14861206,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODYxMjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14861206?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun","html_url":"https://github.com/pierrejeambrun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"hussein-awala","id":21311487,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzExNDg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21311487?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala","html_url":"https://github.com/hussein-awala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ryanahamilton","id":3267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanahamilton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"bbovenzi","id":4600967,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MDA5Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4600967?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi","html_url":"https://github.com/bbovenzi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/received_events","type

is highly unlikely regular PRs will break publishing step for docs building so we should only run this test in case we have \"full-tests-needed\" - which means that we have structurally changed something - either in build scripts or in package structure. Only that can **really** create problems with docks publishing.\r\n\r\nThis saves about 3 minutes - while waiting for the docs building step to complete.\r\n\r\nAlso the condition for actual publishing to our development S3 can be simplified by using `canary-run` variable and making sure it only happens in `main` builds, not in the v2-x-test branches where we have also canary runs but for the patchlevel releases of airflow.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

we decide which tests should be run we err on a safe side and when we see that some files were modified that we cannot classify to specific providers, API, CLI, WWW area, we err on a safe side and assume that we should run all tests (This is called a \"core/other modified\" case. The assumption here is that modificiation of any of the core code or some of the auxiliary utils might affect everyone else.\r\n\r\nHowever - we can safely assume that if only \"tests/always\" files have been modified, then we can remove them from the list - because those tests will anyhow will be executed and changing those tests should have no impact on other tests. Those tests are ALWAYS executed. iThis will - in some cases - avoid running full test suite when we really only run a small subset of those.\r\n\r\nThis was the case for #35457 where it run full test suite, but really only \"Always Providers[common.io]\" were needed.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

our test to detect missing tests was broken, lack of the test_file_transfer.py (among many others) has not been detected before.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a simple test that mocks out ObjectStoragePath and tests that they are initialized properly and that execute method executes `copy` on the source Object poth (but also does not call copy on the target one).\r\n\r\nPart of #35442\r\n\r\nAlso unblocks #35241 which fails becasuse Pytest fails when it sees no tests collected when `Providers[common.io]` TEST_TYPE is used.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n

adds lightweight support for serialization of Apache Iceberg tables.

I think that should find its home in `airflow.catalog` but that is up for discussion.\r\n\r\ncc @Fokko \r\n\r\nThis allows you to do the following:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n\r\nimport polars as pl\r\nfrom pyiceberg.catalog import load_catalog\r\nfrom pyiceberg.table import Table\r\n\r\n@task\r\ndef a_task() -> Table:\r\n  catalog = load_catalog(\"airflow\")\r\n  table = catalog.load_table(\"schema.table\")\r\n  return table\r\n\r\n@task\r\ndef b_task(table: Table) -> pl.DataFrame:\r\n  df = pl.scan_iceberg(table)\r\n  return df\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

common.io provider has been missing from the \"tests\" folder and a side effect of it was that if this was the only provider in \"Providers[common.io]\" the tests were run for absolutely everything

test aimed to make sure that we add tests when we add modules ...\r\n\r\nBut it seems it's been broken for a while and generally it expected no tests at all and never complained (Who tests the tests?)\r\n\r\nThe root cause was generous (pun intended) use of generators - simply speaking when generator gets iterated over, the second time it gets iterated, it returns ... nothing ...\r\n\r\nThese list are not really huge so using generators here has been largely premature optmisation that makes it also difficult to debug, for now I converted it to use lists - debugging of lists is way easier too.\r\n\r\nWe have the list of tests now that we should add and they are captured in the issue #35442\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under

were always building PROD image when we built CI image on CI as we had only one flag \"build-images\" in selective checks. This was based on an assumption that we want to still run docker compose tests with airflow when any of our sources change - just to see if it still works.\r\n\r\nWhile \"docker-compose\" tests are the only end-to-end tests it is very unlikely that unit and integration tests passing will trigger a docker compose test failure.\r\n\r\nThis of course might happen, but if it happens, we will find out during our canary builds that run all the tests and building PROD image in this case is a waste of resources and time - waiting for docker-compose tests to complete when we really do not have to do it makes no sense either. Even if those tests are relatively quick, just waiting for PROD images being built (PROD images have to wait for CI images in order to get constraints from CI builds) adds quite a bit of elapsed test time for many smaller PRs that do not change k8s or Helm in any way.\r\n\r\nThis change splits \"image-build\" into two outputs of selective checks: ci-image-build and prod-image-build. The CI-image build is the same as before - we will build CI image whenever any test need to use the image and run our code (so for example it is false when only README files change). PROD image build is set to true now only when we need kubernetes tests (i.e. when k8s provider changes) or when chart changes - because there we want to test basic functionality of k8s integration and Helm deployment/running.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

The former is fine as default for PROD image (as oppose to CI image we build PROD image from released PyPI packages by default) but the latter is \"proper\" for the CI cache, because there, the image is built out of local packages prepared from sources.\r\n\r\nTurns out that the CONSTRAINT_MODE parameter had a profound impact on caching - because it was set before the\r\n\"install_packages_from_branch_tip\" step and - in fact - even before \"install database clients\" step, which caused our cache to only work for the \"base OS dependencies\" - installing database clients and installing airflow from branch tip (which works great for CI image) had always been done in PRs because the layers in cache with constraints env invalidated all subsequent layers.\r\n\r\nThis had no big impact before when testing usually took much longer time - but since the testing has been vastly improved in #35160, now PROD image building continues running even after test complete and becomes the next frontier of optimization.\r\n\r\nThis PR optimizes PROD image building in two ways:\r\n\r\n* caching is prepared with \"source_providers\" constraint mode, same as regular build\r\n\r\n* the AIRFLOW_CONSTRAINT_MODE and related arguments are moved after installing database clients, so that this parameter does not impact their caching.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

\"Helm Unit Tests\" are special case of tests - they do not run airflow code, they are merely runnig `helm` to process the chart templates with various combinations of parameters. As such, they do not contribute to coverage of Airflow Python code, and they do not generate warnings when the code is run so there is no point in attempting to upload coverage and warnings after the tests complete. This even generates warnings currently in Job summary:\r\n\r\n> Unit tests Helm: other\r\n> No files were found with the provided path: ./files/warnings-*.txt. No\r\n> artifacts will be uploaded.\r\n\r\nThere is no real cleanup we need after those tests because we are not running containers during those tests, so we can safely just remove cleanup steps - not even fix-ownership that helps to deal with files that are created with root owner during container based jobs.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

#34953\r\n\r\n**In brief:**\r\nThe operator failed to reset the dag run because it failed to handle a case when `trigger_run_id` argument is defined within the `TriggerDagRunOperator`, and when it encounters this code:\r\n```python\r\nparsed_execution_date = timezone.utcnow()\r\n```\r\nThis causes the code in:\r\n```python\r\ndag.clear(start_date=parsed_execution_date, end_date=parsed_execution_date)\r\n```\r\nto fail because `parsed_execution_date` will be used as arguments for a where clause to filter out task instances to be cleared.  This would cause a bug since no task instances would be able to be returned from the call when we set the filter to `parsed_execution_date = timezone.utcnow()`.\r\n\r\n**Modification:**\r\n- Use `dagrun.execution_date` to guarantee that task instances can always be correctly filtered and cleared when resetting the DAG run. \r\n- Add more test cases.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

that documentation in provider files is properly added\r\nand adds missing documentation if not there.\r\n\r\nThe provider documentation for all community providers follows\r\nthe same structure. This PR adds pre-commit that verifies that\r\nsome common structure for all provider documentation is in place\r\nand is properly indexed. Since we are adding a lot of providers\r\nnow, it's worth making a common pre-commit that will verify, and\r\nif needed update and regenerate the content to follow the same\r\npatterns.\r\n\r\nThis PR also changes security.rst to be included content rather\r\nthan one generated during release. Initially this file was\r\nsupposed to be generated at release time and contain generated\r\ndynamic information, but we will change the approach to be similar\r\nto the one in configuration and CLI where the dynamic content\r\nis dynamically generated via sphinx directives in the included\r\nfile.\r\n\r\nIt also turned out that Kubernetes and AWS executors were missing\r\nand entry for those in provider.yaml file - which made them\r\nnot discoverable via \"airflow providers executors\" CLI - this is also\r\nverified now.\r\n\r\nNeeds #35435  and #35436  (only last commit should remain).\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

PR aims to refresh and clean-up all the gitub actions that we use in CI build. It also get rids of actions used in submodules as they have not been very useful and they are confusing on how to update and refresh the actions.\r\n\r\nThe changes:\r\n\r\n* The `github-push-action` is not needed any more. As of newe versions of checkout action we can persist credentials and `fetch-depth: 0` to avoid `detached-head` problem that was there in previous versions and we can simply `git push` the committed changes. Alongside, the name of folder where we check constraints is changed to a much more explicit \"constraints\" from \"repo\" folder.\r\n\r\n* The `configure-aws-credentials` is updated to latest version and careful review of the code in the commit has been done in order to verify it contains no malicious code and following best practices, SHA of the commit is used to checkout the action code. See https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/finding-and-customizing-actions#using-shas The `configure-aws-credentials` organisation is also \"verified partner\" by GitHub so we can rather safely assume it is legitimate to upgrade.\r\n\r\n* Github standard `checkout` action is updated to latest v4\r\n\r\n* We still had `get-workflow-origin` submodule defined even if we have not used for a year now. All Submodule definition is now removed from airflow as none of the actions uses submodules to check out the actions any more.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

PR updates the type of catchup to string and adds support for the `ignore_first` value, to ignore catchup only for the first DagRub.\r\n\r\n### Motivations:\r\n\r\nThe `start_date` is a mandatory parameter, and `catchup=True` is very useful to avoid Airflow skip creating some dag run when there are some pressures on its services, there is a downtime, or the duration of some dag run is greater than the schedule interval, and max_active_runs is set to 1.\r\n\r\nWhen creating dags dynamically from a file/API response, setting catchup to True will create all the dag runs since the start_date,

Intent\r\nThis PR is trying to fix the incorrect execution date shown in SLA alerts.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Context\r\n\r\n- The execution date in a triggered SLA alert is one schedule interval ahead of the expected one. \r\n\r\n- In other words, the execution date of the SLA record inserted into the `SlaMiss` table is incorrect.\r\n\r\n- For example, if a daily task with an execution date `2023-10-23 21:00:00` triggers an SLA alert, the execution date in that alert will be `2023-10-24 21:00:00` rather than `2023-10-23 21:00:00`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Create a simple DAG scheduled every 5 minutes\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport datetime\r\nfrom airflow.models import DAG\r\nfrom airflow.operators.bash import BashOperator\r\n\r\nDEFAULT_ARGS = {\r\n    \"owner\": \"test\",\r\n    \"email\": [\"test@email.com\"]\r\n}\r\n\r\ndag = DAG(\r\n    dag_id=\"test_dag\",\r\n    schedule_interval=\"*/5 * * * *\",\r\n    start_date=datetime.datetime(2023, 10, 20),\r\n    catchup=False\r\n)\r\n\r\nwith dag:\r\n  task = BashOperator(\r\n      task_id=\"task\",\r\n      bash_command=\"sleep 120; dummy command\",\r\n      sla=datetime.timedelta(minutes=1))\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Enable the DAG and mark its first dagrun with execution date T as success.\r\n3. Its second dagrun with execution date T+5 should fail and trigger an SLA alert at T + 11 (T + 5 + 5 + 1).\r\n     However, the execution date of the task in this alert will be T + 10 instead of T + 5, which is not correct.\r\n4. Also, the SLA record in the `SlaMiss` table has a wrong execution date as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Validation\r\n- The above DAG is able to trigger SLA alerts with correct execution dates.\r\n- Add one additional test case to cover this logic.","created_at":"2023-11-02T23:09:09Z","updated_at":"2024-02-11T00:12:58Z","closed_at":"2024-02-11T00:12:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"44aec3c4483a4311da979d2b0b43369f4360846f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"jedcunningham","id":66968678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2OTY4Njc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66968678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham","html_url":"https://github.com/jedcunningham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ephraimbuddy","id":4122866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjI4NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4122866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy","html_url":"https://github.com/ephraimbuddy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

are fixing ``pip`` version during the CI building process to install Airflow - in both CI and PROD image, and it is used to run Airflow. However in PROD image we are copying the `.local` folder with installed airflow and this folder does not contain `pip` as `pip` is installed in the main environment. As result the verison of `pip` in the final image was different than the one fixed by the build process.\r\n\r\nThis did not have too bad consequences as `pip` generally works even with older versions and the base images have rather recent version of `pip` preinstalled, however for consistency we should upgrade `pip` to latest version after copying the .local folder.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

default in FAB, authorization does not use resource ID to verify whether a user has permissions to access a given resource. Except with DAGs. Example: when the user edits a connection in the UI, FAB verifies only if the user has permission to edit connections (and not the specific connection).\r\n\r\nThis PR overrides this behavior and now pass the resource down to the auth manager so they can do some fined-grained access using the resource IDs.\r\n\r\nI also modified how the action permissions are verified. Today, this is done by Flask using the `action_post` method (defined in Flask). This method calls `has_access` without the resource ID. One solution would have been to do (pretty similarly to views) override this method and pass the resource ID down to `has_access`. I figured it was simpler (and better) to not perform any authorization check automatically behind the scene and let the user/developer annotate the action to check permissions. \r\n\r\nResolves #35138\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

bookworm (12) is the current stable version of Debian and it is on the market for more than a year so all the other dependencies should have enough time to catch up.\r\n\r\nWhile Debian bullseye is still supported (oldstable) it will be switching to LTS support mode (managed by volunteers) roughly in July 2024 - but we want to switch our reference images to bookworm long before that date.\r\n\r\nThis PR switches our reference images to Debian Bookworm for Dockerfiles and images that will be released to Airflow 2.8.0.\r\n\r\nSimilarly as with \"Debian buster -> Debian bullseye\" switch we will switch our reference images to bookworm and we will not be publishing images based on bullseye. However our users will still be able to build custom images using our Dockerfiles with bullseye base image until we release Airflow 2.9.0 where the bullseye support will be dropped entirely.\r\n\r\nWe provide release notes and instructions on how users can build the bullseye images if they still want to do it - for example because their system level dependencies will require them to do so, but the users are advised to switch to bookworm-based images as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nThe users will likely still be able to build custom Airflow images for future airflow releases (using Dockerfiles released with Airlfow 2.8), however as of Airflow 2.9, we will not release Dockerfiles with support for that and we will not verify if Airflow with default depenencies can be installed on bullseye Debian.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

diving into the source code, it is unclear to readers that Airflow supports an extended cron syntax due to its usage of croniter. My team spends a lot of time making schedules for our DAGs and I believe it would be helpful to mention this. This documentation change should point readers to croniter for all supported cron formats. Also it provides an example of an extended syntax cron expression which Airflow supports.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.
