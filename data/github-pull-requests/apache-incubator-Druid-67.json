ANY aggregator\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nImplement ANY function that returns the first value that we can find\r\n\r\n- AnySqlAggregator can reuse a lot of code in EarliestLatestSqlAggregator. Hence, added ANY to EarliestLatestSqlAggregator and rename EarliestLatestSqlAggregator to EarliestLatestAnySqlAggregator. (Maybe there can be a better name for that)\r\n\r\n- SQL function keyword is ANY_VALUE since ANY is SQL reserved already.\r\n\r\n- Create LongAnyAggregatorFactory, FloatAnyAggregatorFactory, DoubleAnyAggregatorFactory, StringAnyAggregatorFactory. The combine logic will just return lhs if not null otherwise return rhs. (lhs, rhs are just the column value)\r\n\r\n- Create LongAnyAggregator, FloatAnyAggregator, DoubleAnyAggregator, StringAnyAggregator, LongAnyBufferAggregator, FloatAnyBufferAggregator, DoubleAnyBufferAggregator, StringAnyBufferAggregator. Aggregate logic will just return value if we already see non-null value without getObject from selector. LongAnyBufferAggregator, FloatAnyBufferAggregator, and DoubleAnyBufferAggregator have 0 as default values.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR refactors handling of TopN queries performing aggregations on numeric columns to handle null valued rows, instead of treating them as zero.\r\n\r\nThis is done by modifying `TopNColumnSelectorStrategy` to be both aggregate processor and aggregate store for `DimExtractionTopNAlgorithm`, and for numeric selectors will keep an extra `Aggregator[]` around for aggregating for the `null` value in addition to the type appropriate fastutils map that is currently in place.\r\n\r\nTo reflect the behavior changes, `TopNColumnSelectorStrategy ` has been renamed `TopNColumnAggregatesProcessor `. It still does provide value cardinality to the other algorithms, and the changes should have no footprint change for things not using it.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, i renamed `DimExtractionTopNAlgorithm` to the more generic sounding `HeapBasedTopNAlgorithm` since it is also used for numeric selectors. I don't love this name, so if anyone has any better ideas I'll happily change it.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

For example: -->\r\n\r\nThis PR adds constructors for HashMap, HashSet, and LinkedHashSet that specify an initial size parameter to the forbiddenapi list. It replaces all usage of these constructors with Guava helper methods that take the users parameter for size and create a more optimally sized object for them compared to what they get from the native constructors.\r\n\r\nHashMap, HashSet and LinkedHashSet objects are often created in an inefficient way when the creator specifies a size. Guava has created utilities to take the size desired by the creator and come up with a proper initial size for the underlying object for them. It is explained more clearly [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/30220944/648955). The same is also true for LinkedHashMap, but unfortunately we are still using Guava 16, and the Guava implementation for LinkedHashMaps did not come about until Guava 19.\r\n\r\nI had to add an ignores item in the pom.xml file for `SomeAvroDatum.class` because it is generated at build time so it can't have a suppression annotation inline. If there is a better way to exclude that I'm not thinking of, please let me know.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects.

How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Hadoop ingestion fails due to error \"JavaScript is disabled\", if determine partition map reduce job is run and \"mapreduce.reduce.java.opts\" + \"mapreduce.map.java.opts\" is not set with druid.javascript.enabled=true\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe root cause of the failure is depending on if the determine_partitions map reduce job needs to be run or not. If the determine_partitions map reduce job needs to be run, then it will fail with the \"JavaScript is disabled\" error if \"mapreduce.reduce.java.opts\" + \"mapreduce.map.java.opts\" is not set with druid.javascript.enabled=true. This is due to peon not sending the druid.javascript.enabled value (that is set in the _common/common.runtime.properties) to hadoop when running the determine_partitions map reduce job\r\n\r\nThe determine_partitions is run for many configuration settings. For example, if \"maxRowsPerSegment\" is null but numShard is also null, then maxRowsPerSegment is internally set to default value of 5000000 and the determine_partitions job is run.\r\n\r\nThe fix is simply to include the druid.javascript.enabled prop when running the determine_partitions map reduce job (similar to how we do when we send the index-generator map reduce job. (Note that the druid.javascript.enabled is inject correctly for index-generator job).\r\n\r\nCurrent workaround is to pass the druid.javascript.enabled=true in \"mapreduce.map.java.opts\" and \"mapreduce.reduce.java.opts\" in addition to setting druid.javascript.enabled=true in _common/common.runtime.properties\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\nThis PR changes the behavior of first/last aggregators to respect null values to be more consistent with SQL. Existing behavior can be obtained by filtering numeric columns to not include null values. \r\n\r\nI did some additional digging related to findings of #9154 and #9159, and managed to hit an npe while sorting a top-n query by a 'long first' aggregator. Checking out the comparators, I assumed it had similar issues to #9159 and would be a quick/simple change, but how ever wrong I was.\r\n\r\nIt turns out, the 'first'/'last' family of aggregators was building on top of `NullableNumericAggregatorFactory`, following #8834, though the lack of correct SQL compatible null handling definitely predates that change. Anyway, the problem with using `NullableNumericAggregatorFactory` is that the 'first'/'last' aggregators aren't aggregating numbers, but rather a complex type of a `SerializablePair` containing the timestamp and the number column value. This would make the aggregator result for a row itself be null rather than a pair containing the timestamp and the null right hand side value, which caused all sorts of funny business down the line when sorting or combining values.\r\n\r\nFor a solution, I did some heavy refactoring, pulling out `NumericFirstAggregator`, `NumericFirstBufferAggregator`, `NumericLastAggregator`, and `NumericLastBufferAggregator`. Further refactoring could likely pull out an additional base type between the first and last aggs and buffer aggs, because the only differences is the time comparison and the initial time values, but it gets kind of messy because they aren't in the same package...\r\n\r\nAnyway, common code for tracking if the current value is null for on heap and buffer aggs is in these types, and so on and so forth, comparators fixed up, tests added, and so on, so I _think_ these aggs should now handle null numbers correctly.\r\n\r\nNote: group by v1 queries will incorrectly report 0 for null numeric values in sql compatible mode since I haven't implemented a `ComplexMetricSerde` for long/long, long/float, and long/double pairs.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\nThis PR fixes an issue when a query is ordered by an arithmetic post aggregator on a column that has null values, re-using the double sum comparator.\r\n\r\nThe histogram extension min, max, and quantile post aggregators also had comparators that appeared potentially dangerous with regards to nulls, but in practice should not receive null values because the numbers are computed from either an `ApproximateHistogram` or `FixedBucketsHistogram`, so i left a comment and added comparator tests anyway just to increase coverage i guess? The added tests don't seem especially valuable, so I can optionally remove them.\r\n\r\nThe javascript post agg has also been modified to use this same comparator, though it currently cannot receive null values because they are currently always coerced to a 0 (even if the js function returns null). \r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2020-01-09T13:26:32Z","updated_at":"2020-04-08T09:04:56Z","closed_at":"2020-01-10T21:49:19Z","merged_at":"2020-01-10T21:49:19Z","merge_commit_sha":"85219ece136fddd258c4110e55d45b1c36fc8b2a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":949426540,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5NDk0MjY1NDA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Null%20Handling","name":"Area

#9140 \r\n\r\nThis PR fixes a bug with the LongSumAggregator's comparator, where it did not account for nulls.\r\n\r\nIt adds three new numeric columns with some null values to the sample TSV files used in `TestIndex` and a set of 3 tests in TopNQueryRunnerTest.\r\n\r\nAdditionally:\r\n- As the sample data has been updated with new columns, this PR also updates other query-related tests with the NullHandling initialization and other test adjustments.\r\n- Updates SearchQueryRunner to call `selector.isNull()` in its numeric column selectors since the search query tests were failing on the new sample data columns\r\n- Refactors ScanQueryRunnerTest so that it reads its sample data from the common resource TSV file instead of replicating the data within the test for its main test data (some tests still use test-specific data)\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code

Description\r\nThis PR fixes an issue with the web console data loader wizard, which is using all-caps types 'STRING', 'LONG', 'DOUBLE' when converting something it thinks is a metric into a dimension, which don't get correctly recognized by the dimension schema json deserialization, resulting in the column types defaulting to 'string'.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the types presented in the type dropdown once converted to a dimension differ from the types available to convert a metric to ('string', 'long', 'float' vs 'STRING', 'LONG', 'DOUBLE').\r\n\r\nThese have been standardized to use 'string', 'long', 'float', 'double' in all the places.\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #9107 .\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR. Remove this section if there is no corresponding issue.

If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\nAddressed #9107. Modified ComplexMetrics.java by replacing the existing HashMap with a ConcurrentHashMap. Wrapped the `ComplexMetrics.registerSerde()` method body in `ConcurrentHashMap.compute()` to ensure thread safety.\r\n\r\nRegarding the checklist item for testing in a druid cluster. I am under the assumption that if I can spin up a cluster and use something like the HyperUnique aggregator successfully in a query, that this code will be executed. If that is not the case, I need to perform more local functional testing.\r\n\r\nRegarding the concurrency and unit test checks on the checklist: This is my first time contributing any concurrency related code and am not entirely sure what protocol is here. I see mention of writing tests that test multi-threaded execution, but am unsure if augmenting the existing tests to do multi-threaded testing is desired here. If it is, I can certainly get to work on that, but I wanted to consult with a committer beforehand.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects.

If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [X] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

main changes are the removal of query-result-to-array code from `org.apache.druid.sql.calcite.rel.QueryMaker`, and the addition of these two methods to QueryToolChest:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nList<String> resultArrayFields(QueryType query);\r\nSequence<Object[]> resultsAsArrays(QueryType query, Sequence<ResultType> resultSequence);\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think this improves the design of the code a little bit, but the main benefit is really to support joins on subqueries. The change is needed by this item from the proposal https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/8728:\r\n\r\n> Allow joining on to \"query\" datasources as well. To make this work, we’ll need to add a sense of a ‘standard translation’ of results from certain query types into flat schemas that we can offer column selectors on top of. There may be more than one way to do this, since certain query types (notably, topN and scan) return nested results in some cases. We could do this by adding a new QueryToolChest method.","created_at":"2020-01-05T22:34:43Z","updated_at":"2020-03-26T23:18:49Z","closed_at":"2020-01-16T23:42:11Z","merged_at":"2020-01-16T23:42:11Z","merge_commit_sha":"bd49ec03bcb16930e4c25eab2d62c17b177724e3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":219585748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODU3NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Querying","name":"Area

on top of the subtotalsSpec feature in the groupBy query. This also involves\r\ntwo changes to subtotalsSpec:\r\n\r\n- Alter behavior so limitSpec is applied after subtotalsSpec, rather than applied to\r\n  each grouping set. This is more in line with SQL standard behavior. I think it is okay\r\n  to make this change, since the old behavior was not documented, so users should\r\n  hopefully not be depending on it.\r\n- Fix a bug where virtual columns were included in the subtotal queries, but they\r\n  should not have been.\r\n\r\nAlso fixes two bugs in query equality checking:\r\n\r\n- BaseQuery: Use getDuration() instead of \"duration\" in equals and hashCode, since the\r\n  latter is lazily initialized and might be null in one query but not the other.\r\n- GroupByQuery: Include subtotalsSpec in equals and hashCode.\r\n\r\nRelease-Notes-Update: `subtotalsSpec` user with a `limitSpec` in the query would get a different  ordering of rows as `limitSpec` is now applied in the end on whole result set instead of result set from individual subtotals.","created_at":"2020-01-03T19:03:47Z","updated_at":"2020-03-26T23:16:39Z","closed_at":"2020-02-26T16:52:39Z","merged_at":"2020-02-26T16:52:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"c9faf3e148ad1a1931b3fa5e6e7f00fb1370426c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":219585748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODU3NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Querying","name":"Area

initial step towards #8728. This patch adds enough functionality to implement a joining\r\ncursor on top of a normal datasource. It does not include enough to actually do a query. For\r\nthat, future patches will need to wire this low-level functionality into the query language.\r\n\r\nThe main files in this patch:\r\n\r\n- HashJoinSegment: The virtual join Segment described in #8728.\r\n- HashJoinSegmentStorageAdapter: Storage adapter for that segment; \"makeCursors\" is the\r\n  interesting part.\r\n- HashJoinEngine: Contains JoinColumnSelectorFactory, JoinCursor, which together implement\r\n  the row-by-row logic of a join.\r\n- LookupJoinable: Allows joining onto lookups.\r\n- IndexedTableJoinable: A more flexible Joinable that can have multiple columns in general,\r\n  including multiple key columns. I expect this will be used for joining onto subquery results\r\n  in the future. It may even be used as a sort of super-lookup.\r\n\r\nSee https://gist.github.com/gianm/39548daef74f0373b3c87056e3db4627 for details on how the above things work together.\r\n\r\nSome supporting elements:\r\n\r\n- Added a \"withDimension\" method to DimensionSpec so prefixed dimensions can be rewritten to\r\n  remove their prefixes.\r\n- Added \"canIterate\" and \"iterable\" to LookupExtractor, necessary for right and full joins\r\n  on lookups. It will also be useful for direct queries on lookups in the future.\r\n- Removed \"getSegmentIdentifier\" method from StorageAdapter. It was not being used.\r\n- Moved RowBasedColumnSelectorFactory out of the groupBy engine, reflecting the fact that it\r\n  has been used by other, non-groupBy things. Also, split out the RowAdapter interface, which\r\n  is now used by RowBasedIndexedTable as well.\r\n- Renamed VectorColumnStrategizer to VectorColumnProcessorFactory (see below).\r\n- Added a \"ColumnProcessors\" utility class and \"ColumnProcessorFactory\" interface that is\r\n  currently only used to make join condition matchers in IndexedTableJoinMatcher. It wasn't\r\n  strictly necessary, but I think it's designed better than ColumnSelectorStrategyFactory,\r\n  and could replace it in the future. It's similar in design to VectorColumnProcessorFactory.","created_at":"2019-12-30T16:19:42Z","updated_at":"2020-03-26T23:18:53Z","closed_at":"2020-01-16T21:14:21Z","merged_at":"2020-01-16T21:14:21Z","merge_commit_sha":"a87db7f353cdee4dfa9b541063f59d67706d1b07","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287687,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Feature","name":"Feature","color":"2ceefb","default":false,"description":null},{"id":219585748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODU3NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Querying","name":"Area

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes an issue with Druid SQL table schema construction, where numeric column were not configured as nullable, even when SQL compatible null handling was enabled, meaning that queries filtering by a column being null would be optimized into a no-op.\r\n\r\nThis change causes some other test changes which are now wrapped in `FilteredAggregatorFactory`, but the output should be the same, along with some metadata differences when SQL compatible null handling changes.\r\n\r\nIn the future, we should consider exposing this information about whether or not a column of a segment has numeric null values and selectively mark whether or not a column is nullable based on this information.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid

#8840.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes an issue where the map/reduce jobs created by a HadoopIndexTask running inside an Indexer process didn't pick up configuration properties that were specified in Druid's config files.\r\n\r\nHadoop tasks running in an Indexer process need a reference to the Properties instance created\r\nin PropertiesModule so that the task sees properties that were specified in Druid's config files.\r\n\r\nPeon-based tasks didn't have this issue since they have all properties, including config file properties, specified on their command line by ForkingTaskRunner (so they could use System.getProperties() only).\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/blob/master/licenses.yaml)\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid
