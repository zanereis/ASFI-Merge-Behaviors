Kraft mode Apache Kafka 2.8.0 does advertise the socket port instead of the configured advertised port.\r\n\r\nA broker given with the following configuration\r\n```\r\nlisteners=PUBLIC://0.0.0.0:19092,REPLICATION://0.0.0.0:9091\r\nadvertised.listeners=PUBLIC://envoy-kafka-broker:9091,REPLICATION://kafka-broker1:9091\r\n```\r\nadvertises on the _PUBLIC_ listener _envoy-kafka-broker:19092_, however I would expect that _envoy-kafka-broker:9091_ is advertised. In ZooKeeper mode it works as expected.\r\n\r\nThe reason is that in the BrokerServer at the moment the socket server port is used for registration at the controller: https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/2beaf9a720330615bc5474ec079f8b4b105eff91/core/src/main/scala/kafka/server/BrokerServer.scala#L286\r\n\r\nIn KafkaServer class which is used in ZooKeeper mode the configured advertised port is used: https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/2beaf9a720330615bc5474ec079f8b4b105eff91/core/src/main/scala/kafka/server/KafkaServer.scala#L462\r\n\r\nI changed the BrokerServer class, so that in Kraft mode like in ZooKeeper mode also the configured advertised port is registered.\r\n\r\nI manually tested it with a Docker-Compose setup. It basically runs 3 Kafka Broker with Apache Kafka 2.8 in Kraft mode and an Envoy proxy in front of them. With Apache Kafka 2.8.0 it does not work, because Kafka does not advertise the configured advertised port. For more details about the setup see: https://github.com/ueisele/kafka/tree/fix/kraft-advertisedlisteners-build/proxy-examples/proxyl4-kafkakraft-bug-2.8\r\n\r\nThe same Docker-Compose setup with the fix (proposed in this pull request) works and advertises the configured advertised port. For more details see: https://github.com/ueisele/kafka/tree/fix/kraft-advertisedlisteners-build/proxy-examples/proxyl4-kafkakraft-fix-2.8\r\n\r\nAt the moment there is no dedicated test for BrokerServer class. Therefore I did not create a test so far. Where such a test should be added? Is https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/core/src/test/scala/integration/kafka/server/RaftClusterTest.scala a good

is a draft PR to showcase how complicated is to migrate to Scala3.\r\n\r\nIt includes a necessary change as well (removal of Scala Collections Compat and Java8 Compat libraries). This is needed as those libraries' only purpose was to cross-compile to Scala 2.11 and 2.12.\r\n\r\nAfter this is done, only a bit of workaround gradle was needed (library names for Scala 3 compiler changed).\r\n\r\nThe only code change needed is the renaming of methods like `asJava`, `asScala`, `until`, `from`, and `to` which  were since Scala 2.13.0 (Compat libraries were shadowing those). And this change is pretty automatic.\r\nOn the test file (only 1 didn't really compile) only the right new import needed to be brought in.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

issue (detailed description): https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-12999\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\nAfter upgrading clients to `2.8.0`, reading `ConsumerRecord`'s header keys started resulting in occasional `java.lang.NullPointerException` in case of concurrent access from multiple(2) threads.\r\n\r\n### NPE location\r\nNPE happens here RecordHeader.java:45:\r\n```java\r\npublic String key() {\r\n    if (key == null) {\r\n        key = Utils.utf8(keyBuffer, keyBuffer.remaining()); // NPE here \r\n        keyBuffer = null;\r\n    }\r\n    return key;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What introduced issue\r\nCause of issue is introduced by changes of apache#9223\r\n\r\n### Consequences\r\nCurrent implementation renders RecordHeader not thread-safe for read-only access.\r\n\r\n### Reproducibility\r\nSince issue s concurrent race condition, reproducibility is non-deterministic but easy to reproduce with enough re-attempts\r\nThis PR has test which almost always reproduces issue (wiithout `synchronized`)\r\n\r\n### Fix strategy\r\nThis PR avoids race-condition by having `synchronized` on `key()` and `value()` methods\r\n\r\n### Benchmark\r\nComparison between with and without `synchronized` on `RecordHeader.key()` method\r\n```\r\nBenchmark                              Mode  Cnt   Score   Error  Units\r\nRecordHeaderBenchmark.key              avgt    15  31.308 ± 7.862

PR implements broker-side KRaft snapshots, including both saving and\r\nloading. The code for triggering a periodic broker-side snapshot will come in a\r\nfollow-on PR. Loading should work with just this PR.  It also implements\r\nreloading broker snapshots after initialization.\r\n\r\nIn order to facilitate snapshots, this PR introduces the concept of\r\nMetadataImage and MetadataDelta.  MetadataImage represents the metadata state\r\nretained in memory. It is basically a generalization of MetadataCache that\r\nincludes a few things that MetadataCache does not (such as features and client\r\nquotas.) KRaftMetadataCache is now an accessor for the data stored in this object.\r\nSimilarly, MetadataImage replaces CacheConfigRespository and ClientQuotaCache.\r\nIt also subsumes kafka.server.metadata.MetadataImage and related classes.\r\n\r\nMetadataDelta represents a change to a MetadataImage. When a KRaft snapshot is\r\nloaded, we will accumulate all the changes into a MetadataDelta first, prior to\r\napplying it. If we must reload a snapshot because we fell too far behind while\r\nconsuming metadata, the resulting MetadataDelta will contain all the changes\r\nneeded to catch us up.  During normal operation, MetadataDelta is also used to\r\naccumulate the changes of each incoming batch of metadata records. These\r\nincremental deltas should be relatively small.\r\n\r\nI have removed the logic for updating the various manager objects from\r\nBrokerMetadataListener and placed it into BrokerMetadataPublisher.  This makes\r\nit easier to unit test BrokerMetadataListener.","created_at":"2021-06-26T00:59:30Z","updated_at":"2021-07-06T23:37:01Z","closed_at":"2021-07-06T23:36:01Z","merged_at":"2021-07-06T23:36:01Z","merge_commit_sha":"7bd55f51567d08d35922cf5c23a4b424e58fff9a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2650268685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjUwMjY4Njg1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/kraft","name":"kraft","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/10931/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/10931/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/10931/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/58ecc3276c637977fdd1c686cfae70664944f507","head":{"label":"cmccabe:broker-snaps","ref":"broker-snaps","sha":"58ecc3276c637977fdd1c686cfae70664944f507","user":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":74628042,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NDYyODA0Mg==","name":"kafka","full_name":"cmccabe/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe/kafka","description":"Mirror

Brokers prior to Metadata V4 don't support the **allowAutoTopicCreation** field.\r\n\r\nThe implementation of #3098 introduced a check for old Brokers compatibility falling back to _true_ in _MetadataRequest_'s **allowAutoTopicCreation** field for some operations like **describeTopics**.\r\n\r\nThen, after that backward-compatibility changes, more methods were added to _AdminClient_ like **listOffsets** in #7296 which unfortunately don't have compatibility with old Brokers into account. One might argue that, given that new methods were not present previously, it's not a compatibility break. While this is strictly true, I believe that one of Kafka Clients' most appreciated feature is the ability to use old Brokers with new Clients.\r\n\r\nI've prepared this small PR to fix for this,

Make grace period mandatory\r\n\r\nKIP-633 New APIs for Controlling Grace Period for Windowed Operations\r\n\r\n- Added API changes by KIP-633 for JoinWindows, SessionWindows, TimeWindows and SlidingWindows \r\n- Renamed Windows.DEFAULT_GRACE_PERIOD_MS to DEPRECATED_OLD_24_HR_GRACE_PERIOD\r\n- Added new constant Windows.NO_GRACE_PERIOD to avoid magic constants when 0 is specified as grace Period\r\n- Added preliminary Java unit test cases for new API methods \r\n- Replaced Deprecated calls with equivalent in Examples\r\n- Replaced Deprecated API calls in Scala tests with updated API method calls\r\n- Added Deprecation suppression in Tests for deprecated API method calls in Java and Scala Tests\r\n\r\n@ableegoldman @mjsax @cadonna @showuon please review when you have a moment\r\n\r\nI apologize in advance but I was unable to merge the new changes into the old PR \r\nhttps://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/10740\r\n\r\nI spent a lot of time trying to rebase and merge but it just did not work.

fix to avoid spurious left/outer stream-stream join results, showed\r\nvery low throughput for RocksDB, due to excessive creation of iterators.\r\nInstead of trying to emit left/outer stream-stream join result for every\r\ninput record, this PR adds tracking of the lower timestamp bound of\r\nleft/outer join candidates, and only tries to emit them (and create an\r\niterator) if they are potentially old enough.\r\n\r\nIn our benchmarks, we use a 1-sec join window for inner/left/outer join. Inner join is always stable at 20K rec/sec using RocksDB and 35K rec/sec using in-memory store. Without this fix, throughput for left/outer join with RocksDB drops to 500 rec/sec. Inner join, and in-memory store are not affected. With this fix, we get left/outer join with RocksDB back up to 12K rec/sec.\r\n\r\nCall for review @guozhangwang @spena

tried many solutions and found the addAuthInfo and set Acl to a new digest ID would fail the build, somehow.

kafka folks - Would it be possible to also merge it to 2.7? Thanks!\r\n\r\nThe changes in this PR enable connecting VS Code's remote debugger to a system test running locally with ducker-ak.\r\nChanges include:\r\n- added zip_safe=False to setup.py - this enables installing kafkatest module together with source code when running `python setup.py  develop/install`.\r\n- install [debugpy](https://github.com/microsoft/debugpy) on ducker nodes\r\n- expose 5678 (default debugpy port) on ducker01 node - ducker01 is the one that actually executes tests, so that's where you'd connect to.\r\n- added `-d|--debug` option to `ducker-ak test` command - if used, tests will run via `python3.7 -m debugpy` command, which would listen on 5678 and pause until debugger is connected.\r\n- changed the logic of the `ducker-ak test` command so that ducktape args are collected separately after `--` - otherwise any argument we add to the `test` command in the future might potentially\r\nshadow a similar ducktape argument. \r\n\t- we don't really check that `ducktape_args` are args while `test_name_args` are actual test names, so the difference between the two is minimal actually - most importantly we do check that `test_name_args` is not empty, but we are ok if `ducktape_args` is.\r\n\r\nTested: wrote a small test extending `KafkaTest` and verified it is executed with and without debug flag (to be absolutely fair, the test failed in both cases, but I was looking at whether the debugger connects correctly or not - it does). Ran it with `-- --debug` too to make sure ducktape args are passed correctly.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2021-06-22T02:17:17Z","updated_at":"2021-07-08T15:05:15Z","closed_at":"2021-07-08T15:05:15Z","merged_at":"2021-07-08T15:05:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"058589b03db686803b33052d574ce887fb5cfbd1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/10915/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/10915/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/10915/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/ea95e183271d0042ee1908d7390d9217ad13c157","head":{"label":"stan-is-hate:debug-system-tests","ref":"debug-system-tests","sha":"ea95e183271d0042ee1908d7390d9217ad13c157","user":{"login":"stan-is-hate","id":49661990,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NjYxOTkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49661990?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stan-is-hate","html_url":"https://github.com/stan-is-hate","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stan-is-hate/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stan-is-hate/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stan-is-hate/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stan-is-hate/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stan-is-hate/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stan-is-hate/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stan-is-hate/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stan-is-hate/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stan-is-hate/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":191442483,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTE0NDI0ODM=","name":"kafka-ccs","full_name":"stan-is-hate/kafka-ccs","private":false,"owner":{"login":"stan-is-hate","id":49661990,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NjYxOTkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49661990?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stan-is-hate","html_url":"https://github.com/stan-is-hate","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stan-is-hate/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stan-is-hate/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stan-is-hate/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stan-is-hate/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stan-is-hate/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stan-is-hate/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stan-is-hate/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stan-is-hate/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stan-is-hate/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/stan-is-hate/kafka-ccs","description":"Mirror

is rebased PR for #7884 and #9915.\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to remove tombstones that persist indefinitely due to low throughput. Previously, deleteHorizon was calculated from the segment's last modified time.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, the deleteHorizon will now be tracked in the baseTimestamp of RecordBatches. After the first cleaning pass that finds a record batch with tombstones, the record batch is recopied with deleteHorizon flag and a new baseTimestamp that is the deleteHorizonMs. The records in the batch are rebuilt with relative timestamps based on the deleteHorizonMs that is recorded. Later cleaning passes will be able to remove tombstones more accurately on their deleteHorizon due to the individual time tracking on record batches.\r\n\r\nKIP 534:

\r\nWe noticed that the Error metrics reported in Kafka Connect worker continues to stay even after the task is re distributed to another worker. As a result you would notice over a period of time the task_error_metrics  of a worker would contain the errors of all the tasks  that it had ever come across. \r\nThis is an anti pattern to what other metrics are reported by Kafka Connect worker. The Kafka Connect worker should only report the error metrics of the present task and leave the persistence of the previous tasks to the metrics storage system that is consuming these metrics. \r\nIn the below example we notice that there is only 2 active tasks that are running , but we have more than 20+ tasks error metrics that are available. \r\n \r\nTask counter

broker id starts with 1 (https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/tests/kafkatest/services/kafka/kafka.py#L207) so `round_trip_fault_test.py` fails because it assigns replica to nonexistent broker.\r\n\r\nThe interesting story is the failure happens only on KRaft only. KRaft mode checks the existent ids (https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/metadata/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/controller/ReplicationControlManager.java#L950). By contrast, ZK mode has no such check and the `min.insync.replicas` is set to `1` so this test works with ZK mode even though there is one replica is always off-line.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist

[KIP-618](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-618%3A+Exactly-Once+Support+for+Source+Connectors#KIP618:ExactlyOnceSupportforSourceConnectors-Newmetrics).\r\n\r\nDepends on changes from https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/11046\r\n\r\nThere are several changes here that can be reviewed fairly independently of each other:\r\n- Support for transactional source tasks, which is largely implemented in the `ExactlyOnceWorkerSourceTask` class, its newly-introduced `AbstractWorkerSourceTask` superclass, the `Worker` class (whose API for task starts has been split up from the existing `startTask` method into separate `startSinkTask`, `startSourceTask`, and `startExactlyOnceSourceTask` methods), and the `WorkerTransactionContext` class (which is used to allow connectors to define their own transaction boundaries)\r\n- Zombie fencing logic and the use of a transactional producer for some writes to the config topic, which are done by the leader of the cluster and are largely implemented in the `DistributedHerder`, `ConfigBackingStore`, `KafkaConfigBackingStore`, and `ClusterConfigState` classes\r\n- A new method in the `Admin` API for fencing out transactional producers by ID, which is done with changes to the `Admin` interface (unsurprisingly) and the `KafkaAdminClient` class\r\n- Support for per-connector offsets topics, which touches on the `Worker`, `OffsetStorageReaderImpl`, and `OffsetStorageWriter` classes\r\n- A few new `SourceConnector` methods for communicating support for exactly-once guarantees and connector-defined transactions; these take place in the `SourceConnector` class (also unsurprisingly) and the `AbstractHerder` class\r\n\r\nExisting unit tests are expanded where applicable, and new ones have been introduced where necessary.\r\n\r\nEight new integration tests are added, which cover scenarios including preflight validation checks, all three types of transaction boundary, graceful recovery of the leader when fenced out from the config topic by another worker, ensuring that the correct number of task producers are fenced out across generations, accurate reporting of failure to bring up tasks when fencing does not succeed (includes an ACL-secured embedded Kafka cluster to simulate one of the most likely potential causes of this issue--insufficient permissions on the targeted Kafka cluster), and the use of a custom offsets topic.\r\n\r\nMany but not all existing system tests are modified to add cases involving exactly-once source support, which helps give us reasonable confidence that the feature is agnostic with regards to rebalance protocol. A new test is added that is based on the existing bounce test, but with no sink connector and with stricter expectations for delivery guarantees (no duplicates are permitted).\r\n\r\n### Committer

KIP-726, we want to make \"cooperative-sticky, range\" as default assignor. But before this can be applied, we need to handle some important cooperative-sticky assignor bugs first. We plan to implement it in early V3.1. In V3.0, we plan to make \"range, cooperative-sticky\" as the default assignor, so that if user wants to use cooperative-sticky assignor from old version byte-code, they just need 1 rolling bounce, to set the cooperative-sticky assignor in the `PARTITION_ASSIGNMENT_STRATEGY_CONFIG` config.\r\n\r\nThis PR also adds test to make sure the default assignor is still **range** assignor.\r\n\r\n###

and index files are currently renamed with a .deleted\r\nsuffix prior to async deletion. This serves two purposes, to\r\nresume deletion on broker failure and also protect against\r\ndeletion of new segments during truncation (due to deletion\r\nbeing async).\r\n\r\nWe should do the same for snapshot files. While they are not subject\r\nto issues around resuming deletion due to the stray snapshot\r\nscanning which is performed on log initialization, we can end up\r\nwith situations where truncation queues snapshots for deletion, but\r\nprior to deletion new segments with the same snapshot file name are\r\ncreated. Async deletion can then delete these new snapshots.\r\n\r\nThis patch offers a two-stage snapshot deletion which first renames\r\nand removes the segments in question from the

patch introduces a new delayed operation which effectively ensures that a SyncGroup request is received from all the stable members in the groups within the rebalance timeout. The timer starts when the group transitions to the `CompletingRebalance` state. The previous mechanism based on `DelayedHeartbeat` did not work anymore because of https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/8834 which allows heartbeats while the group is in the

`TestSecurityRollingUpgrade. test_disable_separate_interbroker_listener()` system test had a design flaw: it was migrating inter-broker communication from a SASL_SSL listener to an SSL listener in one roll while immediately removing the SASL_SSL listener in that roll.  This requires two rolls because the existing SASL_SSL listener must remain available throughout the first roll so that unrolled brokers can continue to communicate with rolled brokers throughout.  This patch adds the second roll to this test and removes the original SASL_SSL listener on that second roll instead of the first one.  The test was not failing all the time -- it was flaky.\r\n\r\nThe `TestSecurityRollingUpgrade.test_rolling_upgrade_phase_two()` system test was not explicitly identifying the SASL mechanism to enable on a third port when that port was using SASL but the client security protocol was not SASL-based.  This was resulting in an empty `sasl.enabled.mechanisms` config, which applied to that third port, and then when the cluster was rolled to take advantage of this third port for inter-broker communication the potential for an inability to communicate with other, unrolled brokers existed (similar to above, this resulted in a flaky test).\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit

had been using `RecordAccumulator.beginFlush` in order to force the `RecordAccumulator` to flush pending batches when a transaction was being completed. Internally, `RecordAccumulator` has a simple counter for the number of flushes in progress. The count gets incremented in `beginFlush` and it is expected to be decremented by `awaitFlushCompletion`. The second call to decrement the counter never happened in the transactional path, so the counter could get stuck at a positive value, which means that the linger time would effectively be ignored.\r\n\r\nThe patch here fixes the problem by removing the use of `beginFlush` in `Sender`. Instead, we now add an additional condition in `RecordAccumulator` to explicitly check when a transaction is being completed. \r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ]

The problem here is, when old stream closed, we won't trigger rebalance immediately due to the stream clients are all static members as described in KIP-345, which means, we will trigger trigger group rebalance only when `session.timeout` expired. That said, when old client closed, we'll have at least 45 sec with some tasks not working. \r\n\r\nAlso, in this test, we have 2 timeout conditions to fail this test before verification passed:\r\n1. 6 minutes timeout\r\n2. polling 30 times (each with 5 seconds) without getting any data. (that is, 5 * 30 = 150 sec without consuming any data)\r\n\r\nFor (1), in my test under 45 session timeout, we'll create 8 stream clients, which means, we'll have 5 clients got closed. And each closed client need 45 sec to trigger rebalance, so we'll have 45 * 5 = 225 sec (~4 mins) of the time having some tasks not working. \r\nFor (2), during new client created and old client closed, it need some time to do rebalance. With 45 session timeout, we only got ~100 sec left.

PR includes changes to KafkaRaftClient and KafkaMetadataLog to support periodic cleaning of old log segments and snapshots. \r\n\r\nFour new public config keys are introduced\r\n\r\n* metadata.log.segment.bytes\r\n* metadata.log.segment.ms\r\n* metadata.max.retention.bytes\r\n* metadata.max.retention.ms\r\n\r\nThese are used to configure the log layer as well as the snapshot cleaning logic. Snapshot and log cleaning is performed based on two criteria: total metadata log + snapshot size (metadata.max.retention.bytes), and max age of a snapshot (metadata.max.retention.ms). Since we have a requirement that the log start offset must always align with a snapshot, we perform the cleaning on snapshots first and then clean what logs we can. The cleaning algorithm follows:\r\n\r\n* Delete the oldest snapshot\r\n* Advance the log start offset to the new oldest snapshot\r\n* Request that the log layer clean any segments prior to the new log start offset\r\n* Repeat this until the retention size or time is no longer violated, or only a single snapshot remains\r\n\r\nThe cleaning process is triggered every 60 seconds from the KafkaRaftClient polling thread.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-06-10T19:50:06Z","updated_at":"2021-07-06T21:21:23Z","closed_at":"2021-07-06T21:20:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a1e3ce2be458f764d1c2b45c0e979f58c74af5ad","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2650268685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjUwMjY4Njg1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/kraft","name":"kraft","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/10864/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/10864/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/10864/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/4aca4489af380de292a3d4acad7cd11318908cd0","head":{"label":"mumrah:kafka-12155-metadata-log-cleaning","ref":"kafka-12155-metadata-log-cleaning","sha":"4aca4489af380de292a3d4acad7cd11318908cd0","user":{"login":"mumrah","id":55116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah","html_url":"https://github.com/mumrah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":5542805,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NTQyODA1","name":"kafka","full_name":"mumrah/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mumrah","id":55116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah","html_url":"https://github.com/mumrah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mumrah/kafka","description":"Mirror

a group transitions to the `CompletingRebalance` state, the group coordinator sets up `DelayedHeartbeat` for each member of the group. It does so to ensure that the member sends a sync request within the session timeout. If it does not, the group coordinator rebalances the group. Note that here, `DelayedHeartbeat` is used here for this purpose. `DelayedHeartbeat` are also completed when member heartbeats.\r\n\r\nThe issue is that https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/8834 has changed the heartbeat logic to allow members to heartbeat while the group is in the `CompletingRebalance` state. This was not allowed before. Now, if a member starts to heartbeat while the group is in the `CompletingRebalance`, the heartbeat request will basically complete the pending `DelayedHeartbeat` that was setup previously for catching not receiving the sync request. Therefore, if the sync request never comes, the group coordinator does not notice anymore.\r\n\r\nThis patch introduced a new delayed operation which effectively ensure that a SyncGroup request is received from any stable members of the groups within the rebalance timeout. The timer starts when the group transitions to the `CompletingRebalance` state.\r\n\r\nNote that I think that this is a bit more strict that we used to have prior to https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/8834 as we were previously relying on the session timeout to expire in this case.

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-12926\r\n\r\nInstead of setting \"null\" to negative offsets partition (as in KAFKA-9507), this PR aims to skip those cases from the returned list, because setting them in \"null\" can cause java.lang.NullPointerExceptions on downstreams methods that tries to access the data on them, because they are expecting an _OffsetAndMetadata_ and they encouter null values.\r\n\r\nFor example, at ConsumerGroupCommand.scala at core:\r\n```\r\n  val partitionOffsets = consumerSummary.assignment.topicPartitions.asScala\r\n            .map { topicPartition =>\r\n              topicPartition -> committedOffsets.get(topicPartition).map(_.offset)\r\n            }.toMap\r\n```\r\nIf topicPartition has an negative offset, the committedOffsets.get(topicPartition) is null (as defined on KAFKA-9507), which translates into null.map(_.offset), which will lead to: _Error: Executing consumer group command failed due to null\r\njava.lang.NullPointerException_\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n`./kafka-consumer-groups.sh --describe --group order-validations`\r\n\r\n`Error: Executing consumer group command failed due to

we had an interface named\r\norg.apache.kafka.controller.SnapshotWriter and a concrete implementation\r\nclass called org.apache.kafka.snapshot.SnapshotWriter.\r\n\r\nAs part of unit tests, it is often helpful to be able to use an\r\ninterface to mock snapshot writing and reading. Therefore, we should\r\nmake the interface class part of the Raft package, not the controller\r\npackage. This PR moves SnapshotWriter into that package and renames the\r\nconcrete class to RaftSnapshotWriter.\r\n\r\nThis PR also harmonizes the two classes. For example, \"completeSnapshot\"\r\nbecomes \"freeze\" (since that's what it was in the raft package).\r\nSimilarly, \"writeBatch\" becomes \"append\".  SnapshotWriter is now\r\ntemplated on the record type, in order to be generic, rather than\r\nspecific to metadata.\r\n\r\nThe controller code sometimes refers to the snapshot's end offset as its\r\n\"epoch\". This is confusing since there is also the concept of a raft log\r\nepoch. I have tried to remove most of these uses and replace them with\r\n\"endOffset\", which is more descriptive.\r\n\r\nI also fixed an off-by-one error where we advanced lastCommittedOffset\r\nto be just before a snapshot's endOffset, rather than at a snapshot end\r\noffset.\r\n\r\nFinally, I removed snapshotId from the reader and writer interface.\r\nSince snapshots are only ever taken (or indeed read) from committed\r\noffsets, there is no need for the controller or broker to supply this\r\ninformation to the raft layer. The end offset is sufficient. The raft\r\nlayer can look up the relevant information if there is any need for it.","created_at":"2021-06-09T23:58:58Z","updated_at":"2021-06-15T23:40:24Z","closed_at":"2021-06-15T23:40:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"29bb959fbf24b1f304d8280acfdf7bc83faab772","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2650268685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjUwMjY4Njg1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/kraft","name":"kraft","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/10857/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/10857/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/10857/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/025fab7883fbb6708b45da3744b8d759d96b269c","head":{"label":"cmccabe:snap_interface","ref":"snap_interface","sha":"025fab7883fbb6708b45da3744b8d759d96b269c","user":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":74628042,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NDYyODA0Mg==","name":"kafka","full_name":"cmccabe/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe/kafka","description":"Mirror

PR aims to upgrade `zstd-jni` from `1.4.9-1` to `1.5.0-2`.\r\n\r\nThis change will incorporate a number of bug fixes and performance improvements made in `1.5.0` of `zstd`:\r\n- https://github.com/facebook/zstd/releases/tag/v1.5.0\r\n- https://github.com/luben/zstd-jni/releases/tag/v1.5.0-1\r\n- https://github.com/luben/zstd-jni/releases/tag/v1.5.0-2\r\n\r\nThe most recent `1.5.0` release offers +25%-140% (compression) and +15% (decompression) performance\r\nimprovements under certain conditions. Those conditions are unlikely to apply to Kafka with the default\r\nconfiguration, however.\r\n\r\nSince this is a dependency change, this should pass all the existing CIs.\r\n\r\n### Committer
