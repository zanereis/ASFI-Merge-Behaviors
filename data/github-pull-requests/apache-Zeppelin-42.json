What is this PR for?\n\nHBase interpreter fails with message \"ERROR: KeeperErrorCode = ConnectionLoss for /hbase\" when connecting to a remote HBASE (for instance, HBase running in CDH cluster)\n\nInitially it's thought that zkquoram setttings are not getting applied, but deeper investigations reveal that hbase-site.xml cannot be loaded.\n\nHBASE_HOME or HBASE_CONF_DIR is set by `hbase` script when running hbase shell - interpreter will need to at minimum replicate that behavior to add the directory with hbase-site.xml to CLASS_PATH in order to fix this issue.\n### What type of PR is it?\n\nBug Fix\n### Todos\n- [x] - Bug fix\n- [x] - Update documentation\n### What is the Jira issue?\n\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-767\n### How should this be tested?\n\n(tested) Run HBase locally (standalone: https://hbase.apache.org/book.html#quickstart)\n(tested) Set HBASE_HOME in env and work with HBASE on a Hadoop cluster\n(tested) Set HBASE_CONF_DIR in env and work with HBASE on a Hadoop cluster\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\n\nN/A\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update? No\n- Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\n- Does this needs documentation?

What is this PR for?\n\nThis is a step towards creating a REST endpoint from resource pools  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-699\n\nIt allows resources to be fully serializable so that the object that they contain can be passed around using thrift.\n### What type of PR is it?\n\nImprovement\n### Todos\n- [X] - Add serialization for rest endpoint\n### What is the Jira issue?\n\nPartially implements this:  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-699\n\nNote, that this pull request is dependent upon this one:  \nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-zeppelin/pull/781\n\nBefore that change is made, this will not compile.\n### How should this be tested?\n\nThere is a test class \"org.apache.zeppelin.ResourceSerializerTest\", but with no front-end, there isn't an easy manual way to test this.\n\nHowever, these steps will work:\n1. Start Zeppelin\n2. Run a paragraph.\n3.  Inspect \"org.apache.zeppelin.resource.ResourcePoolUtils.getAllResources()\".  You will see that this paragraph's results are included in this resource pool.\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update? No\n- Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\n- Does this needs documentation?  No.\n","created_at":"2016-03-16T15:12:34Z","updated_at":"2018-05-09T05:26:28Z","closed_at":"2018-05-09T05:26:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"956d00fa0cf9672da7e425f3c98f9f3c9985ec8a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/782/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/782/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/782/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/8fa84a832200351465793f83aafe8d1c0c3c3573","head":{"label":"fireboy1919:persist_pool","ref":"persist_pool","sha":"8fa84a832200351465793f83aafe8d1c0c3c3573","user":{"login":"fireboy1919","id":8417951,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0MTc5NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8417951?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fireboy1919","html_url":"https://github.com/fireboy1919","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fireboy1919/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fireboy1919/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fireboy1919/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fireboy1919/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fireboy1919/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fireboy1919/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fireboy1919/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fireboy1919/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fireboy1919/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":45635008,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NTYzNTAwOA==","name":"incubator-zeppelin","full_name":"fireboy1919/incubator-zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fireboy1919","id":8417951,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0MTc5NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8417951?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fireboy1919","html_url":"https://github.com/fireboy1919","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fireboy1919/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fireboy1919/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fireboy1919/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fireboy1919/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fireboy1919/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fireboy1919/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fireboy1919/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fireboy1919/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fireboy1919/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fireboy1919/incubator-zeppelin","description":"Mirror

What is this PR for?\n\nThe Spark interpreter currently honors whatever is set for spark.executor.memory in spark-defaults.conf upon startup, but if you look at the Interpreter page, you'll see that it has a default of 512m. If you restart a running Spark interpreter from this page, the new SparkContext will use this new default of spark.executor.memory=512m instead of what it had previously pulled from spark-defaults.conf.\n\nRemoving this 512m default from SparkInterpreter code will allow spark.executor.memory to default to whatever value may be set in spark-defaults.conf, falling back to the Spark built-in default (which, btw, has for a few Spark versions been 1g, not 512m anymore).\n### What type of PR is it?\n\nImprovement\n### Todos\n\nN/A\n### What is the Jira issue?\n\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-735\n### How should this be tested?\n- Set spark.executor.memory to some value in spark-defaults.conf (say, 5120m)\n- Run a Spark paragraph in Zeppelin\n  - The Spark application will correctly use the spark.executor.memory value from spark-defaults.conf (both before and after this change).\n- View Interpreter page in Zeppelin UI\n  - Before this change: spark.executor.memory will be displayed as 512m instead of what is in spark-defaults.conf\n  - After this change: spark.executor.memory will be blank\n- Restart Spark Interpreter from this page and run a Spark paragraph\n  - Before this change: the new Spark application will incorrectly use the spark.executor.memory=512m value shown on the Interpreter page\n  - After this change: the new Spark application will correctly use the spark.executor.memory value from spark-defaults.conf\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\n\nN/A\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update? NO\n- Is there breaking changes for older versions? NO\n- Does this needs documentation?

What is this PR for?\n\nCurrently, notebook authorization information is stored in the note file (note.json). The purpose of this PR is to store the authorization information in notebook-authorization.json in the conf directory. There is no change to the user experience.\n\nThe long-term goal is to make NotebookAuthorization an interface with implementation to store the authorization information with Shiro.\n### What type of PR is it?\n\nImprovement\n### Todos\n- [x] - Code review\n### What is the Jira issue?\n\n[ZEPPELIN-666](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-666)\n### How should this be tested?\n1. Enable Basic Auth Security by changing conf/shiro.ini.\n2. Create a note. By default all operations are allowed by any authenticated user.\n3. Update readers, writers and owners by clicking on the lock icon in the top right area.\n4. Check if users can or cannot perform operations according to the permissions.\n5. Check if notebook-authorization.json has correct authorization information.\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\n\nNot applicable.\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update?   No\n- Is there breaking changes for older versions?   No\n- Does this needs documentation?   No\n","created_at":"2016-03-07T21:41:16Z","updated_at":"2016-03-14T16:46:54Z","closed_at":"2016-03-14T16:46:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f0f211495f4d2911f613dc0c2c9c3e9caf5168d0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/766/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/766/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/766/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/3ad6b3127b60bdffde7a7293ae29d9d04355b32e","head":{"label":"prasadwagle:ZEPPELIN-666","ref":"ZEPPELIN-666","sha":"3ad6b3127b60bdffde7a7293ae29d9d04355b32e","user":{"login":"prasadwagle","id":870829,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MDgyOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/870829?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/prasadwagle","html_url":"https://github.com/prasadwagle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prasadwagle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prasadwagle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prasadwagle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prasadwagle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prasadwagle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prasadwagle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prasadwagle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prasadwagle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prasadwagle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":45803838,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NTgwMzgzOA==","name":"incubator-zeppelin","full_name":"prasadwagle/incubator-zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"prasadwagle","id":870829,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MDgyOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/870829?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/prasadwagle","html_url":"https://github.com/prasadwagle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prasadwagle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prasadwagle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prasadwagle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prasadwagle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prasadwagle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prasadwagle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prasadwagle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prasadwagle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prasadwagle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/prasadwagle/incubator-zeppelin","description":"Mirror

What is this PR for?\n\nWhen a user runs Spark interpreter, the result will come out with result number message like :\n\n```\nres0: Int = 250\n```\n\nSomeone might want to print this REPL output with their result, but others may want to see the result only since sometimes this output is too verbose. So, I just want to give an option to hide this REPL output to those users. \n\nThe default value of `zeppelin.spark.printREPLOutput` is `true`. This status is as-is. Users can hide REPL output only when they changes this property `true` to `false`. In this case, they can check the result by specifying such as `print(some_variable)`.\n### What type of PR is it?\n\nImprovement\n### Todos\n- [x] - Add a property `zeppelin.spark.printREPLOutput` \n- [x] - Add Spark interpreter property table to `docs/spark.md`\n### What is the Jira issue?\n\n[ZEPPELIN-688](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-688#)\n### How should this be tested?\n\nAfter applying this PR,\n1. Create spark interpreter for this test and change `zeppelin.spark.printREPLOutput` property value `true` -> `false`\n2. Create a notebook and bind interpreter what you made.\n3. Write `val a = 250` down and run this paragraph. Then you can check the any output is not shown although paragraph status is **FINISHED** (This is the result of this PR).\n4. Run `print(a)` in the next paragraph. Then finally you can get a result `250`.\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\n\n![spark-result](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10060731/13560814/8ec3080e-e467-11e5-9059-e4edf57a38a6.gif)\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update? No\n- Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\n- Does this needs documentation? I added Spark interpreter property table to `docs/spark.md`.\n","created_at":"2016-03-07T05:31:56Z","updated_at":"2016-03-10T21:17:34Z","closed_at":"2016-03-10T21:17:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2603f62a3b25483bb4823b2e7c9310c53fb7ff66","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/764/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/764/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/764/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/c4bbe3393af4639b442b0e47545ce922a4003cf3","head":{"label":"AhyoungRyu:ZEPPELIN-688","ref":"ZEPPELIN-688","sha":"c4bbe3393af4639b442b0e47545ce922a4003cf3","user":{"login":"AhyoungRyu","id":10060731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYwNzMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10060731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu","html_url":"https://github.com/AhyoungRyu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44792338,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDc5MjMzOA==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"AhyoungRyu/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AhyoungRyu","id":10060731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYwNzMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10060731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu","html_url":"https://github.com/AhyoungRyu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AhyoungRyu/zeppelin","description":"Mirror

What is this PR for?\n\nResourcePool is introduced by ZEPPELIN-619.\nHowever, it didn't provide any automatic resource release on paragraph / note removal unlike paragraph scope angular object which is quite helpful in practical use.\n\nThis PR adds noteId and paragraphId to ResourceId, so resource can be identified by noteId and paragraphId in addition to resourcePoolId and name.\nBy using informations in ResourceId, automatically release resource when note / paragraph remove.\n\nSo now, it's possible to put InterpreterResult into the resource pool safely, which might be useful for ZEPPELIN-374 and ZEPPELIN-533.\n### What type of PR is it?\n\nImprovement\n### Todos\n- [x] - Add noteId and paragraphId to ResourceId\n- [x] - Release resource when note / paragraph remove\n- [x] - Put InterpreterResult into resource pool\n- [x] - Unit test\n### What is the Jira issue?\n\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-713\n### How should this be tested?\n\nYou can get resourcePool from InterpreterContext and print items inside of spark interpreter. (note. resource pool is not spark interpreter specific feature. But so far spark interpreter provides user api to access it)\n\nYou can see InterpreterResult is automatically shared to resourcePool and they're removed on note/paragraph remove.\n\n```\n%md\nhello world\n\n%spark\n// print items in resource pool.\nimport collection.JavaConversions._\nval pool = z.getInterpreterContext.getResourcePool\npool.getAll.foreach(i=>println(i + \" \" + i.get))\n```\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update? no\n- Is there breaking changes for older versions? no\n- Does this needs documentation? no\n","created_at":"2016-03-05T15:07:08Z","updated_at":"2016-03-15T18:34:13Z","closed_at":"2016-03-15T18:34:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a586b98c229d649deda8a4af37de6076cb2a024b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/763/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/763/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/763/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/473dd6f7e5cce911a05f16a64f4b103869fbb4b9","head":{"label":"Leemoonsoo:ZEPPELIN-713","ref":"ZEPPELIN-713","sha":"473dd6f7e5cce911a05f16a64f4b103869fbb4b9","user":{"login":"Leemoonsoo","id":1540981,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDA5ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1540981?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo","html_url":"https://github.com/Leemoonsoo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":32886931,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjg4NjkzMQ==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"Leemoonsoo/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Leemoonsoo","id":1540981,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDA5ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1540981?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo","html_url":"https://github.com/Leemoonsoo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Leemoonsoo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Leemoonsoo/zeppelin","description":"Mirror

What is this PR for?\n\nAdd notification system for AngularJS z functions. Now that we expose the `z` Angular object, we should also catch error/exceptions and display error messages properly to the user.\n\nI changed a little bit the default settings for **ngToast**. Instead of having notifications on **bottom right**, I let the default value undefined.\n\nFor **Interpreter** page notification, I force the position to **bottom right** as before when using default config.\n\nFor `z` functions error messages, I choose to display notifications on **top right** corner because it's clearer. See screen capture\n\n_This is a sub-task of epic **[ZEPPELIN-635](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-635)**_\n### What type of PR is it?\n\n[Improvement]\n### Todos\n- [ ] - Code Review\n- [ ] - Simple Test\n### Is there a relevant Jira issue?\n\n**[ZEPPELIN-696](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-696)**\n### How should this be tested?\n- `git fetch origin pull/744/head:AngularJSNotification`\n- `git checkout AngularJSNotification`\n- `mvn clean package -DskipTests`\n- `bin/zeppelin-daemon.sh restart`\n- Create a new note\n- In the first paragraph, put the following code\n\n``` html\n%angular\n\n<form class=\"form-inline\">\n  <button type=\"submit\" class=\"btn btn-primary\" ng-click=\"z.runParagraph()\"> Run Paragraph Without Id</button>\n  <button type=\"submit\" class=\"btn btn-primary\" ng-click=\"z.runParagraph('20160223-141919_305734436')\"> Run Paragraph Without Wrong Id</button>\n  <button type=\"submit\" class=\"btn btn-primary\" ng-click=\"z.angularBind('superhero', superhero)\"> Angular Bind Without Paragraph Id</button>\n  <button type=\"submit\" class=\"btn btn-primary\" ng-click=\"z.angularUnbind('superhero')\"> Angular UnBind Without Paragraph Id</button>\n</form>\n```\n- Click on each button to see the appropriate error message\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\n\n![angularnotification](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1532977/13901504/734b5112-ee26-11e5-9962-bcf2101eb700.gif)\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update? -->

What is this PR for?\n\nAdd AngularJS `z.runParagraph()` method\n\n@corneadoug \nOn the client-side, inside the scope of a paragraph, we cannot access to the list of all existing paragraphs for the current note. In my previous implementation, I was using the following trick:\n\n```\nvar paragraphDiv = angular.element('#' + paragraphId +\n                                '_paragraphColumn_main[ng-controller=\"ParagraphCtrl\"]');\n\nvar paragraph = paragraphDiv.scope().paragraph;\n```\n\nThis is **dirty** and can be broken if we change the CSS style tomorrow for paragraph.\n\nFor the current implementation, what I did is to **inject** a reference to the `note` object into the `$scope` of paragraph so that we can access the current list of paragraph **programmatically**: \n\n``` javascript\n        $scope.$broadcast('updateParagraph', {\n          note: $scope.note, // pass the note object to paragraph scope\n          paragraph: note.paragraphs[index]});\n```\n\n``` html\n  <div id=\"{{currentParagraph.id}}_paragraphColumn_main\"\n       ng-repeat=\"currentParagraph in note.paragraphs\"\n       ng-controller=\"ParagraphCtrl\"\n       ng-Init=\"init(currentParagraph, note)\"\n```\n\n_This is a sub-task of epic **[ZEPPELIN-635](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-635)**_\n### What type of PR is it?\n\n[Improvement### Todos\n- [ ] - Code Review\n- [ ] - Simple Test\n### Is there a relevant Jira issue?\n\n**[ZEPPELIN-695](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-695)**\n### How should this be tested?\n- `git fetch origin pull/742/head:AngularJSRunParagraph`\n- `git checkout AngularJSRunParagraph`\n- `mvn clean package -DskipTests`\n- `bin/zeppelin-daemon.sh restart`\n- Create a new note\n- In the first paragraph, put the following code\n\n``` html\n%angular\n\n<form class=\"form-inline\">\n  <div class=\"form-group\">\n    <label for=\"paragraphId\">Paragraph Id: </label>\n    <input type=\"text\" class=\"form-control\" id=\"paragraphId\" placeholder=\"Paragraph Id ...\" ng-model=\"paragraph\"></input>\n  </div>\n  <button type=\"submit\" class=\"btn btn-primary\" ng-click=\"z.runParagraph(paragraph)\"> Run Paragraph</button>\n</form>\n```\n- Create a second paragraph with the following code:\n\n``` scala\nprintln(\"Date \"+new java.util.Date().toString)\n```\n- Retrieve the paragraph id of the 2nd paragraph\n- In the first paragraph, put the paragraph id in the input text and click on the **Run Paragraph** button, it should trigger execution of the second paragraph\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\n\n![angularrunparagraph](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1532977/13898909/ee3767bc-ede0-11e5-9996-79aa3b5c465c.gif)\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update? -->

What is this PR for?\n\nAdd client-side `z` object with method `angularBind()`\n\n@Leemoonsoo \n\nCompared to the original implementation, I have simplified a lot.\n\nNow, you can only bind angular variable to one unique scope, which is the **paragraph**. I just remove the note scope and also remove the `interpreter` parameter. \n\nIndeed, when passing a `paragraphId`, on the server-side, we can retrieve the `Paragraph` object with the `noteId` + `paragraphId` so we can now which interpreter is currently being used.\n\nThe signature of the `angularBind(varName, value, paragraphId)` method has also been greatly simplified.\n\n_This is a sub-task of epic **[ZEPPELIN-635](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-635)**_\n### What type of PR is it?\n\n[Improvement]\n### Todos\n- [ ] - Code review\n- [ ] - Simple test\n### Is there a relevant Jira issue?\n\n**[ZEPPELIN-689](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-689)**\n### How should this be tested?\n- `git fetch origin pull/740/head:AngularJSBind`\n- `git checkout AngularJSBind`\n- `mvn clean package -DskipTests`\n- `bin/zeppelin-daemon.sh restart`\n- Create a new note\n- In the first paragraph, put the following code\n\n``` html\n%angular\n\n<form class=\"form-inline\">\n  <div class=\"form-group\">\n    <label for=\"superheroId\">Super Hero: </label>\n    <input type=\"text\" class=\"form-control\" id=\"superheroId\" placeholder=\"Superhero name ...\" ng-model=\"superhero\"></input>\n  </div>\n  <button type=\"submit\" class=\"btn btn-primary\" \n    ng-click=\"z.angularBind('superhero', superhero, 'PUT_HERE_PARAGRAPH_ID')\"> Bind Angular</button>\n</form>\n```\n- Create a second paragraph with the following code:\n\n``` scala\nz.angular(\"superhero\")\n```\n- Retrieve the paragraphId of the second paragraph\n- In the first paragraph, replace the text **PUT_HERE_PARAGRAPH_ID** by the correct paragraph id\n- In the input text, put \"Superman\" and click on the **Bind Angular** button\n- Execute the second paragraph to see that the _superhero_ variable is now set to **Superman**\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\n\n![angularbind](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1532977/13251894/3e5324aa-da33-11e5-89a9-8702cc4c08f6.gif)\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update? --> **No**\n- Is there breaking changes for older versions? --> **No**\n- Does this needs documentation? --> **Yes**\n","created_at":"2016-02-23T12:53:18Z","updated_at":"2016-03-18T16:24:16Z","closed_at":"2016-03-18T16:24:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d78a0e18b94c6c0f7e4d2dd198891962089c86da","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/740/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/740/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/740/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/4aa83f5a2dcf5d67d6ddcdba1402bf3643965299","head":{"label":"doanduyhai:ZEPPELIN-689","ref":"ZEPPELIN-689","sha":"4aa83f5a2dcf5d67d6ddcdba1402bf3643965299","user":{"login":"doanduyhai","id":1532977,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzI5Nzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1532977?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai","html_url":"https://github.com/doanduyhai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35973266,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTk3MzI2Ng==","name":"incubator-zeppelin","full_name":"doanduyhai/incubator-zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"doanduyhai","id":1532977,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzI5Nzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1532977?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai","html_url":"https://github.com/doanduyhai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/doanduyhai/incubator-zeppelin","description":"Mirror

What is this PR for?\n\nAlthough Shell Interpreter has already had [command timeout property](https://github.com/apache/incubator-zeppelin/blob/master/shell/src/main/java/org/apache/zeppelin/shell/ShellInterpreter.java#L49), users can not change this property via Zeppelin UI. So I added some code lines to `ShellInterpreter.java` so that users can change this value at the interpreter setting tab.\n### What type of PR is it?\n\nImprovement\n### Todos\n- [x] - Enable user to change shell interpreter command timeout property\n- [x] - Fix a dead link in `interpreter.java`\n### Is there a relevant Jira issue?\n\n[ZEPPELIN-691](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-691)\n### How should this be tested?\n\nAfter applying this PR, you can make `%sh` interpreter at the Zeppelin interpreter setting section. \n1. Change `shell.command.timeout.millisecs` 600000(default value) -> 5000 so that you can check quickly\n2. Run \n- **Success Case**\n  \n  ```\n  %sh\n  date && sleep 3 && date\n  ```\n  \n  then you can get a result as below \n  \n  ```\n  Mon Feb 22 18:25:00 KST 2016\n  Mon Feb 22 18:25:03 KST 2016\n  ExitValue: 143\n  ```\n- **Error Case(because of timeout property)**\n  \n  ```\n  %sh\n  date && sleep 6 && date\n  ```\n  \n  then you can get a result as below \n  \n  ```\n  Mon Feb 22 18:25:00 KST 2016\n  Paragraph received a SIGTERM.\n  ExitValue: 143\n  ```\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\n\n**Before**\n![screen shot 2016-02-22 at 7 01 32 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10060731/13215178/efbcd26a-d996-11e5-96dd-1fc01a6c96ea.png)\n\n**After**\n![screen shot 2016-02-22 at 6 57 29 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10060731/13215151/ccbdd62e-d996-11e5-81e5-0eda4de7603d.png)\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update?

What is this PR for?\n\npyspark.zip, py4j-*.zip should be distributed to yarn nodes to make pyspark function but this hasn't been working after #463 because [`if (pythonLibs.length == pythonLibUris.size())`](https://github.com/apache/incubator-zeppelin/blob/master/spark/src/main/java/org/apache/zeppelin/spark/SparkInterpreter.java#L329) condition will never be true.

What is this PR for?\n\nThis is to give Windows first-class support for running Zeppelin without the need for Cygwin or other hacks.\n### What type of PR is it?\n\nImprovement\n### Todos\n- [x] - Fix notebook dir path handling which right now assumes URI compatible string (see https://github.com/apache/incubator-zeppelin/blob/master/zeppelin-zengine/src/main/java/org/apache/zeppelin/notebook/repo/VFSNotebookRepo.java#L63)\n- [x] - Add documentation for configuring and running on Windows\n- [x] - Independent code review of the CMD scripts to ensure they're correct\n### Is there a relevant Jira issue?\n\nZEPPELIN-647\n### How should this be tested?\n- Pull this PR\n- Build\n- Override default ZEPPELIN_NOTEBOOK_DIR in zeppelin-env.cmd to be an absolute file URI such as file:///c:/notebook\n- Start with bin\\zeppelin.cmd\n- If using any Hadoop system ensure you have winutils.exe in your HADOOP_HOME\\bin, see (https://github.com/steveloughran/winutils)\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update? No\n- Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\n- Does this needs documentation? Yes\n","created_at":"2016-02-20T15:42:21Z","updated_at":"2016-03-24T15:05:04Z","closed_at":"2016-03-24T15:05:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"43ffbee0ab2f23e83170ee53be3d9ed675bfa761","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/734/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/734/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/734/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/8aadd457629da9f6ee6cce2e40e262e5875b6f00","head":{"label":"granturing:windows-support","ref":"windows-support","sha":"8aadd457629da9f6ee6cce2e40e262e5875b6f00","user":{"login":"granturing","id":1418471,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MTg0NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1418471?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/granturing","html_url":"https://github.com/granturing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granturing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granturing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granturing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granturing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granturing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granturing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granturing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granturing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granturing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":51043163,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MTA0MzE2Mw==","name":"incubator-zeppelin","full_name":"granturing/incubator-zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"granturing","id":1418471,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MTg0NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1418471?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/granturing","html_url":"https://github.com/granturing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granturing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granturing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granturing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granturing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granturing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granturing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granturing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granturing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/granturing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/granturing/incubator-zeppelin","description":"Mirror

What is this PR for?\n\nAn update/follow-on for PR 152 that is limited to Leaflet support. There doesn't appear to have been any new movement on PR 152 since August 2015, so this PR updates @Madhuka's work against master, but without any of the data validation or other non-Leaflet work.\n### What type of PR is it?\n\nFeature\n### Todos\n\nN/A\n### Is there a relevant Jira issue?\n\nZEPPELIN-157\n### How should this be tested?\n\nRecreate @Madhuka's example, e.g. use the following to populate a cell:\n  https://gist.github.com/eddies/f20241e161aa2bbbb788\n\nThen, in a new cell\n\n```\n%sql\nselect * from myMap\n```\n\nThere should a new chart selector rightmost that will render the data w/ leaflet. You may need to clean your browser cache initially.\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\n\n![leaflet](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/149985/13422633/f72016ee-dfd0-11e5-979a-6454a72d9ef9.gif)\nAlso see Madhuka's original PR: https://github.com/apache/incubator-zeppelin/pull/152\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update? no\n- Is there breaking changes for older versions? no\n- Does this needs documentation? Probably. It wasn't clear to me if PR 152 was going to move ahead in a new, Leaflet-only incarnation as suggested in the comment thread. But I needed Leaflet support, so went ahead with my own fork. I'm happy to work on documentation for this, but not sure if a sample notebook tutorial is what's desired (e.g. maybe something under the Display System docs is preferable?). If so, I'd just stick with something like the sample notebook in PR

What is this PR for?\n\nRefactor download and use travis' builtin mechanism to retry on failure - hopefully it will then hit a different apache mirror; this should mitigate the intermitted download failures that result in test failures\n### What type of PR is it?\n\nImprovement\n### Todos\n- [x] - Separate download script\n- [x] - Travis to retry download step\n- [x] - Add timeout to kill download if not complete in 5 min (need to tune this)\n- [x] - Add timer to log how long download takes\n### Is there a relevant Jira issue?\n\nN/A\n### How should this be tested?\n\nTravis\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\n\nN/A\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update? No\n- Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\n- Does this needs documentation? No\n","created_at":"2016-02-19T02:55:45Z","updated_at":"2016-02-25T22:42:35Z","closed_at":"2016-02-24T00:51:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"099ea3a23e6c487d8f737c8f13897e2647df5274","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/727/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/727/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/727/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/5bfebea4b195c4ae63348cab67e6afa8ee930bb0","head":{"label":"felixcheung:retrydownload","ref":"retrydownload","sha":"5bfebea4b195c4ae63348cab67e6afa8ee930bb0","user":{"login":"felixcheung","id":8969467,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5Njk0Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8969467?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung","html_url":"https://github.com/felixcheung","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":32882096,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjg4MjA5Ng==","name":"incubator-zeppelin","full_name":"felixcheung/incubator-zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"felixcheung","id":8969467,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5Njk0Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8969467?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung","html_url":"https://github.com/felixcheung","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felixcheung/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/felixcheung/incubator-zeppelin","description":"Mirror

action.\n\n![csvexport](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2636054/13156756/e4c43d82-d638-11e5-9bfc-a45ae7f60380.gif)\n![tableauexport](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2636054/13157016/624653ca-d63a-11e5-9afa-3c4936eddfa5.gif)\n","created_at":"2016-02-18T20:14:20Z","updated_at":"2017-11-07T01:46:08Z","closed_at":"2017-01-11T18:26:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2af3991cac6fbf14c9f7a0d8564ddf89b0036ba3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/725/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/725/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/725/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/eaf207591750da188262eea21b895ac76504136b","head":{"label":"brigade:exporterFeature","ref":"exporterFeature","sha":"eaf207591750da188262eea21b895ac76504136b","user":{"login":"brigade","id":7872961,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjc4NzI5NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7872961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brigade","html_url":"https://github.com/brigade","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brigade/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brigade/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brigade/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brigade/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brigade/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brigade/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brigade/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brigade/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brigade/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":50545549,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MDU0NTU0OQ==","name":"incubator-zeppelin","full_name":"brigade/incubator-zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"brigade","id":7872961,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjc4NzI5NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7872961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brigade","html_url":"https://github.com/brigade","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brigade/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brigade/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brigade/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brigade/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brigade/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brigade/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brigade/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brigade/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brigade/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/brigade/incubator-zeppelin","description":"Mirror

What is this PR for?\n\nAbout a month ago, Shiro authentication for Zeppelin is merged by #586. Even though we already have [SECURITY-README.md](https://github.com/apache/incubator-zeppelin/blob/master/SECURITY-README.md), many people do not know about the existence of this file. So I wrote a docs based on `SECURITY-README.md` to the Zeppelin documentation website to guide step by step for Zeppelin users. \n### What type of PR is it?\n\nDocumentation\n### Todos\n- [x] - Add shiro authentication docs\n- [x] - Add **zeppelin.anonymous.allowed** property in `zeppelin-site.md`\n- [x] - Indent **Websocket security** section in `SECURITY-README.md`\n### Is there a relevant Jira issue?\n\n[ZEPPELIN-661](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-661)\n### How should this be tested?\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\n\n![screen shot 2016-02-12 at 11 29 29 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10060731/12997376/09a010d4-d17c-11e5-80f8-93906eb238e8.png)\n![screen shot 2016-02-12 at 11 29 53 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10060731/12997395/363f1702-d17c-11e5-9334-52dec85083f5.png)\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update?

What is this PR for?\n\nWhile investigating CI failure with PR #706, I noticed that we were running all tests in each of 6 jobs in the test matrix.\n\nIt seems we have accidentally switched back to running all tests even with older versions of Spark. (from PR #626\n\nFiltering out interpreter tests for these runs help make test jobs faster (~30%) and also reduce the chance that an interpreter test might intermittently fail, thus hopefully improve CI reliability.\n\nAlso changing Spark 1.2.1 to 1.2.2 (last 1.2.x release)\n### What type of PR is it?\n\nImprovement\n### Todos\n- [x] - Travis CI yml changes\n### Is there a relevant Jira issue?\n\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-665\n### How should this be tested?\n\nRun Travis CI\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\n\nN/A\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update?
