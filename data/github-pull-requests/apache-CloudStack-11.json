Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, users have no control on whether they receive Quota emails or not. If the Quota plugin is enabled, they will receive all applicable emails.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, there is currently no way to set the (`min_balance`) configuration without adding credits to the account. That value acts as a threshold for the QUOTA_LOW email template. However, there should be a way to easily configure it.\r\n\r\nTo address the described problems, this PR creates a new API (`quotaConfigureEmail`) which will has the following parameters: (`accountid:String, emailTemplateName:String, enable:Boolean, minBalance:Integer`).    \r\n\r\n*    Regarding the API parameters:\r\n     *    (`accountid`) is required, since all configurations will only be in the accounts scope.\r\n     *    (`emailTemplateName`) is not required, unless the (`enable`) parameter is informed.\r\n     *    (`enable`) is not required, unless the (`emailTemplateName`) parameter is informed.\r\n     *    (`minBalance`) is not required. When informed, it will set the (`minBalance`) attribute in the (`quota_account`) table.\r\n*    Regarding the API functionality:\r\n     *    When the (`accountid, emailTemplateName, enable`) parameters are informed, the email referenced by (`emailTemplateName`) will be enabled/disabled based on (`enable`) for account referenced by (`accountid`). \r\n     *    When the (`accountid, minBalance`) parameters are informed, the (`min_balance`) of the account referenced by (`accountid`) will be set.\r\n     *    While a email template is not configured for a given account using this API, the default behavior will be maintained, that is, the email template will be considered as enabled.\r\n\r\nFurthermore,  a second API (`quotaListEmailConfiguration`) was created, which has a single parameter: (`accountid:String`).    \r\n\r\n*    Regarding the API functionality:\r\n     *    The API lists all the email template configurations for the given account.\r\n\r\nTo improve the user experience, the account-level setting `quota.enable.emails` was also created, which defines whether or not Quota emails will be sent to the account. By default, the setting has the value `true`. When the setting is enabled, it is possible to disable sending specific email types (`QUOTA_EMPTY`, `QUOTA_LOW`, `QUOTA_STATEMENT` and `QUOTA_UNLOCK_ACCOUNT`) to the account via the

Description\r\n\r\nNeeds some rework which will be done after https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/8362/ is merged.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the resource count discrepancies which happen when resource count is being incremented or decremented and recalculation of resource count happens at the same time.\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\nRequires 2 Management servers to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. On MS1, Add a debugger at\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/724394682c73d3aaa7991ab899c97c2c3dcbbb63/server/src/main/java/com/cloud/resourcelimit/ResourceLimitManagerImpl.java#L889\r\n3. Deploy a VM.\r\n4. When the debugger stops at above line, execute cmk update resourcecount domainid=`1on MS2 to trigger recalculation of resource count (this also happens periodically. cmk command triggers the same method on demand). cmk command will get blocked because of the debugger.\r\n5. Resume the debugger.\r\n6. cmk command will complete and you will see the discrepancy error in logs.\r\n\r\nYou will see a log line with the following text\r\n```\r\nDiscrepency in the resource count has been detected (original count = 1 correct count = 2) for Type = user_vm for Domain ID = 2 is fixed during resource count recalculation\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified,

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the test failures with CKS HA-cluster upgrade.\r\nIn production, the CKS HA cluster should have at least 3 control VMs as well.\r\nThe etcd cluster requires 3 members to achieve reliable HA. The etcd daemon in control VMs uses RAFT protocol to determine the roles of nodes.

Description\r\n\r\nThe Default View has a `projects` toggle button that allows users to see which resources belong to projects, but there is nothing to indicate which project they belong to.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, a `project` column was added if the `projects` button is enabled, indicating the name of the project to which the resource belongs.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds missing indexes on `alerts` & `events` tables.\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\nFor alerts table, some of the queries are part of a couple of APIs and some operations. I have added the index for the same.

Indexes were missing, so I have added those.\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to

Description\r\n\r\nOn no access to the storage nodes, we now create a temporary resource from the snapshot and copy that data into the secondary storage. Revert works the same, just that we now also look additionally for any Linstor agent node.\r\n\r\nAlso enables now backup snapshot by default.\r\n\r\nThis whole BackupSnapshot functionality was introduced in 4.19,\r\nso I would be happy if this still could be merged.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to

Description\r\n\r\nWhen HTTP is used to upload volumes, templates and ISOs (configuration `use.https.to.upload` is set to `false`), an error occurs during the validation of the request's signature, preventing uploads from finishing successfully. This happens because an URL in the format `String fullUrl = \"https://\" + hostname + \"/upload/\" + uuid` is always created for the validation whether HTTP or HTTPS was being used.\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses this issue, allowing users to upload volumes, templates and ISOs through HTTP.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [X] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nFirst, before applying the changes, I set `use.https.to.upload` to `false` and recreated the SSVM. Then, through the UI:\r\n1. I tried to upload a template and verified that the signature validation failed;\r\n2. I tried to upload an ISO and verified that the signature validation failed;\r\n3. I tried to upload a volume and verified that the signature validation failed.\r\n\r\nI applied the changes and, with `use.https.to.upload` still set to `false`, I recreated the SSVM. Then, through the UI:\r\n1. I tried to upload a template and verified that the upload finished successfully;\r\n2. I tried to upload an ISO and verified that the upload finished successfully;\r\n3. I tried to upload a volume and verified that the upload finished

Description\r\n\r\nThe KVM Agent has the `hypervisor.uri` configuration to define the connection with Libvirt; however, this property is ignored and a hardcoded value is used in many parts of the code.\r\n\r\nThis PR intends to prioritize the `hypervisor.uri` property in Libvirt connections and use the hypervisor default URI only when this configuration is not defined.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [X] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [X] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nI followed the same steps from `How did you try to break this feature...` and verified that the host was only using the URI defined in the `hypervisor.uri` property.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### How did you try to break this feature and the system with this change?\r\n\r\n1. Add the `hypervisor.uri` property to a host's agent.properties, `hypervisor.uri=qemu:///session` for example;\r\n2. Check the agent logs;\r\n3. Although the `hypervisor.uri` property is defined, the agent is still using the hypervisor default URI in many

Description\r\n\r\n## <section id=\"problem-description\">1. Problem description</section>\r\n\r\nIn Apache CloudStack (ACS), when a VM is deployed in a host with the KVM hypervisor, an XML file is created in the assigned host, which has a property <code>shares</code> that defines the weight of the VM to access the host CPU. The value of this property has no unit, and it is a relative measure to calculate how much CPU a given VM will have in the host. However, this value has a limit, which depends on the version of cgroup utilized by the host's kernel. The problem lies at the range value of shares that varies between both versions: [2, 264144] for cgroups version 1; and [1, 10000] for cgroups version 2. Currently, ACS calculates the value of <code>shares</code> using Equation 1, presented below, where <code>CPU</code> is the number of cores and <code>speed</code> is the CPU frequency; both specified in the VM's compute offering. Therefore, if a compute offering has, for example, 6 cores at 2 GHz, the <code>shares</code> value will be 12000 and an exception will be thrown by libvirt if the host utilizes cgroup v2. The second version is becoming the default one in current Linux distributions; thus, it is necessary to address this limitation.\r\n\r\n- **Equation 1**\r\n  <code>shares = CPU * speed</code>\r\n\r\n---\r\nFixes: #6744 \r\n\r\n## <section id=\"proposed-changes\">2. Proposed changes</section>\r\n\r\nTo address the problem described, we propose to apply a scale conversion considering the max <code>shares</code> of the host. Using the same formula currently utilized by ACS, it is possible to calculate the maximum <code>shares</code> of a VM for a given host. In other words, using the number of cores and the nominal speed of the host's CPU as the upper limit of <code>shares</code> allowed to a VM. Then, this value will be scaled to the allowed interval of [1, 10000] of cgroup v2 by using a linear scale conversion.\r\n\r\nThe VM <code>shares</code> would be calculated as Equation 2, presented below, where <code>VM requested shares</code> is the requested <code>shares</code> value calculated using Equation 1, <code>cgroup upper limit</code> is fixed with a value of 10000 (cgroups v2 upper limit), and <code>host max shares</code> is the maximum <code>shares</code> value of the host, calculated using Equation 1. Using Equation 2, the only case where a VM passes the cgroup v2 limit is when the user requests more resources than the host has, which is not possible with the current implementation of ACS.\r\n\r\n- **Equation 2**\r\n  <code>shares = (VM requested shares * cgroup upper limit)/host max shares</code>\r\n\r\nTo implement the proposal, the following APIs will be updated: <code>deployVirtualMachine</code>, <code>migrateVirtualMachine</code> and <code>scaleVirtualMachine</code>. When a VM is being deployed, a new verification will be added to find a suitable host. The max <code>shares</code> of each host will be calculated, and the VM calculated <code>shares</code> will be verified if it does not surpass the host's value. Likewise, the migration of VMs will have a similar new verification. Lastly, the scale of VMs will also have the same verification for the VM's host.\r\n\r\nTo determine the max <code>shares</code> of a given host, we will use the same equation currently used in ACS for calculating the <code>shares</code> of VMs, presented in <a href=\"#problem-description\" class=\"internal-link\">Section 1</a>. When Equation 1 is used to determine the maximum <code>shares</code> of a host, <code>CPU</code> is the number of cores of the host, and <code>speed</code> is the nominal CPU speed, i.e., considering the CPU's base frequency.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that these changes are only for hosts with the KVM hypervisor using cgroup v2 for now.\r\n\r\n## <section id=\"example\">Example</section>\r\n\r\nTo exemplify the proposed changes, consider a host with the following specification: 32 CPU cores with nominal speed of 2 GHz; and a VM with a compute offering with 8 CPU cores and with speed of 2 GHz. With the current ACS implementation, the <code>shares</code> of the VM would be calculated as Equation 1. Thus, the VM <code>shares</code> would be 16000, over the cgroup v2 limit of 10000.\r\n\r\nWith the proposed changes, the VM <code>shares</code> would be calculated as Equation 2. In this example, <code>VM requested shares</code> is 16000, <code>cgroup upper limit</code> is fixed with a value of 10000, and <code>host max shares</code> is 64000. Therefore, the VM <code>shares</code> results in 2500, well below the cgroup v2 limit.\r\n\r\n## <section id=\"real-case-scenarios\">Real case scenarios</section>\r\n\r\nTo demonstrate real case scenarios, consider the following hosts:\r\n\r\n- **Host A**\r\n  - **\\# of Cores:** 32\r\n  - **CPU nominal frequency:** 2 GHz\r\n  - **Max Shares:** 64000\r\n- **Host B**\r\n  - **\\# of Cores:** 16\r\n  - **CPU nominal frequency:** 2 GHz\r\n  - **Max Shares:** 32000\r\n\r\nTable 1 below presents a set of VMs with their requested resources, alongside the <code>shares</code> values considering the current implementation, and the new <code>shares</code> value, for each host, considering the proposed change using Equation 2.\r\n\r\n- Table 1\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n\r\n<thead>\r\n\r\n<tr>\r\n\r\n<th rowspan=\"2\">VM</th>\r\n\r\n<th rowspan=\"2\">CPU cores</th>\r\n\r\n<th rowspan=\"2\">CPU frequency (GHz)</th>\r\n\r\n<th rowspan=\"2\">Current shares</th>\r\n\r\n<th colspan=\"2\">New shares</th>\r\n\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n<tr>\r\n\r\n<th>For Host A</th>\r\n\r\n<th>For Host B</th>\r\n\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n</thead>\r\n\r\n<tbody>\r\n\r\n<tr>\r\n\r\n<td>VM 1</td>\r\n\r\n<td>2</td>\r\n\r\n<td>2</td>\r\n\r\n<td>4000</td>\r\n\r\n<td>625</td>\r\n\r\n<td>1250</td>\r\n\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n<tr>\r\n\r\n<td>VM 2</td>\r\n\r\n<td>4</td>\r\n\r\n<td>2</td>\r\n\r\n<td>8000</td>\r\n\r\n<td>1250</td>\r\n\r\n<td>2500</td>\r\n\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n<tr>\r\n\r\n<td>VM 3</td>\r\n\r\n<td>6</td>\r\n\r\n<td>2</td>\r\n\r\n<td>12000</td>\r\n\r\n<td>1875</td>\r\n\r\n<td>3750</td>\r\n\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n<tr>\r\n\r\n<td>VM 4</td>\r\n\r\n<td>8</td>\r\n\r\n<td>2</td>\r\n\r\n<td>16000</td>\r\n\r\n<td>2500</td>\r\n\r\n<td>5000</td>\r\n\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n<tr>\r\n\r\n<td>VM 5</td>\r\n\r\n<td>16</td>\r\n\r\n<td>2</td>\r\n\r\n<td>32000</td>\r\n\r\n<td>5000</td>\r\n\r\n<td>10000</td>\r\n\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n<tr>\r\n\r\n<td>VM 6</td>\r\n\r\n<td>32</td>\r\n\r\n<td>2</td>\r\n\r\n<td>64000</td>\r\n\r\n<td>10000</td>\r\n\r\n<td>20000</td>\r\n\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n</tbody>\r\n\r\n</table>\r\n\r\nTable 2 below presents if the same VMs in Table 1 would be allowed to be allocated to a given host, or if an exception would be thrown, considering current and proposed implementations.

VM 6 should throw an exception when trying to deploy it in host B in both implementations, as the host does not have enough resources to allocate it.\r\n\r\n- Table 2\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n\r\n<thead>\r\n\r\n<tr>\r\n\r\n<th rowspan=\"2\">VM</th>\r\n\r\n<th colspan=\"2\">Host A<br></th>\r\n\r\n<th colspan=\"2\">Host B</th>\r\n\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n<tr>\r\n\r\n<th>Current Implementation</th>\r\n\r\n<th>Proposed Implementation</th>\r\n\r\n<th>Current Implementation</th>\r\n\r\n<th>Proposed Implementation</th>\r\n\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n</thead>\r\n\r\n<tbody>\r\n\r\n<tr>\r\n\r\n<td>VM 1</td>\r\n\r\n<td>Allowed</td>\r\n\r\n<td>Allowed</td>\r\n\r\n<td>Allowed</td>\r\n\r\n<td>Allowed</td>\r\n\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n<tr>\r\n\r\n<td>VM 2</td>\r\n\r\n<td>Allowed</td>\r\n\r\n<td>Allowed</td>\r\n\r\n<td>Allowed</td>\r\n\r\n<td>Allowed</td>\r\n\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n<tr>\r\n\r\n<td>VM 3</td>\r\n\r\n<td>Exception</td>\r\n\r\n<td>Allowed</td>\r\n\r\n<td>Exception</td>\r\n\r\n<td>Allowed</td>\r\n\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n<tr>\r\n\r\n<td>VM 4</td>\r\n\r\n<td>Exception</td>\r\n\r\n<td>Allowed</td>\r\n\r\n<td>Exception</td>\r\n\r\n<td>Allowed</td>\r\n\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n<tr>\r\n\r\n<td>VM 5</td>\r\n\r\n<td>Exception</td>\r\n\r\n<td>Allowed</td>\r\n\r\n<td>Exception</td>\r\n\r\n<td>Allowed</td>\r\n\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n<tr>\r\n\r\n<td>VM 6</td>\r\n\r\n<td>Exception</td>\r\n\r\n<td>Allowed</td>\r\n\r\n<td>Exception</td>\r\n\r\n<td>Exception</td>\r\n\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n</tbody>\r\n\r\n</table>\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that Equation 2 rounds up the <code>shares</code> value; thus, there is a precision loss with the conversion. Nevertheless, this precision loss should not be noticeable to the end user, as the <code>shares</code> value would need to be in a very close interval, e.g. <code>shares</code> values of <code>3997</code>, <code>3998</code> and <code>3999</code> would be considered as <code>1249</code> in host B with the new implementation. However, the precision loss is a small drawback for enabling support of cgroup v2 to ACS.\r\n\r\n## <section id=\"future-works\">3. Future works</section>\r\n\r\nWith the current proposal, only cgroups version 2 is addressed, as it has impactful limitations. Thus, as future work, cgroups version 1 will also be addressed using the same strategy of linear scale conversion.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [x] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [x] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nConsider the host `host-1` with cgroup v2, `host-2` with cgroup v1 and the following custom constrained compute offering below:\r\n\r\n- **Frequency:** 2 GHz\r\n- **Cores:** 2 - 6\r\n- **RAM**: 1 GB\r\n\r\n## Deploy of VMs\r\n\r\nI created the VM `vm-tmpfs` with 5 cores and allocated it to host `host-2`.\r\n```bash\r\nubuntu@host-2:~$ virsh dumpxml --domain i-2-13-VM | grep shares\r\n    <shares>10000</shares>\r\n```\r\n\r\nI created the VM `vm-cgroupv2` with 5 cores and allocated it to host `host-1`.\r\n```bash\r\nubuntu@host-1:~$ virsh dumpxml --domain i-2-15-VM | grep shares\r\n    <shares>6667</shares>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs expected, ACS considered the host resources to set the `shares` values. When the host utilizes the cgroup v1, the default behavior is not changed.\r\n\r\n## VM live scale\r\n\r\nI lived scale the VM `vm-tmpfs`, changing its number of cores from 5 to 6.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nubuntu@host-2:~$ virsh dumpxml --domain i-2-13-VM | grep shares\r\n    <shares>10000</shares>\r\nubuntu@host-2:~$ virsh dumpxml --domain i-2-13-VM | grep shares\r\n    <shares>12000</shares>\r\n```\r\n\r\nI lived scale the VM `vm-cgroupv2`, changing its number of cores from 5 to 6.\r\n```bash\r\nubuntu@host-1:~$ virsh dumpxml --domain i-2-15-VM | grep shares\r\n    <shares>6667</shares>\r\nubuntu@host-1:~$ virsh dumpxml --domain i-2-15-VM | grep shares\r\n    <shares>8000</shares>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs expected, ACS considered the host resources to set the `shares` values. When the host utilizes the cgroup v1, the default behavior is not changed.\r\n\r\n## VM migration\r\n\r\nI migrated VM `vm-tmpfs` from host `host-2` to host `host-1` (from cgroupv1 to cgroupv2). After the migration, the `shares` values was changed to `8000`, as expected.\r\n```bash\r\nubuntu@host-1:~$ virsh dumpxml --domain i-2-13-VM | grep shares\r\n    <shares>8000</shares>\r\n```\r\n\r\nI migrated VM `vm-cgroupv2` from host `host-1` to host `host-2` (from cgroupv2 to cgroupv1). After the migration, the `shares` values was changed to `12000`, as expected.\r\n```bash\r\nubuntu@host-2:~$ virsh dumpxml --domain i-2-15-VM | grep shares\r\n    <shares>12000</shares>\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### How did you try to break this feature and the system with this change?\r\n\r\nI migrated VMs between hosts with different cgroup versions, the VM migration

Description\r\n\r\nWhen creating a private gateway, if an ACL verification error occurs, the changes made up to that point are not rolled back, resulting in inconsistent records in the database.\r\n\r\nThis PR intends to fix this bug and, if an error occurs during the creation of the private gateway, the changes will be rolled back.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [X] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes

[X] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nI followed the same steps from `How did you try to break this feature and the system with this change?` and verified in the database that the network created to the private gateway was rolled back.\r\n\r\n#### How did you try to break this feature and the system with this change?\r\n\r\n1. Create 2 VPCs (VPC1 and VPC2);\r\n2. Create an ACL for VPC2;\r\n3. Using CloudMonkey, try to create a private gateway in VPC1 using the ACL from VPC2 (an exception will be thrown: `Private gateway and network acl are not in the same vpc`);\r\n4. Check the `networks` table in the database and the network created to the private gateway will be

Description\r\n\r\nDates are always stored in GMT in the database. However, when using the Usage and Quota APIs, dates are manipulated according to the configuration `usage.aggregation.timezone`. Therefore, when informing a date, the user must consider the timezone defined in the configuration and the timezone of the server in order to specify a value. Furthermore, if the configuration and the server are not in the same timezone, ACS will not retrieve the data the user requested.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the behavior of Usage and Quota APIs to consider dates as they were informed. Some examples showing how the current date manipulation may yield unexpected results and how this change fixes them can be found in the tests section.\r\n\r\nThe APIs affected by this change are:\r\n- `listUsageRecords`: the return of this API was also changed to always return the data in GMT, instead of depending on the timezone of the configuration. This way, it complies with the other APIs and allows users to handle the timezone in the frontend;\r\n- `quotaCredits`: when adding credits to an account, the deposit date is now stored in GMT;\r\n- `quotaBalance`: in addition, it is now possible to inform an `enddate` in the future;\r\n- `quotaStatement`: it is also now possible to inform an `enddate` in the future;\r\n- `quotaTariffCreate`;\r\n- `quotaTariffDelete`:\r\n- `quotaTariffList`;\r\n- `quotaTariffUpdate`.\r\n\r\nWith the extension that allows users to inform timezones on APIs that have the date parameter (#7032), it is recommended to inform dates in the format `yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssz`. When a date is informed in `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss` or `yyyy-MM-dd`, it will be considered that the date was informed in the timezone of the server.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [X] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nIn a local lab, I defined `usage.aggregation.timezone` as GMT-3.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes several issues in the testing of Veeam 11 and Veeam12\r\n- Import Veeam.Backup.PowerShell and silently ignore the warning messages\r\n- Fix issue when assign vm to backup offerings, which caused by separator (\\r\\n)\r\n- Fix authorization failure in veeam 12a, which is because v1_4 is not supported in veeam 12a any more\r\n- Fix exception if backup name has space\r\n- Fix backup metrics in veeam12, which is because powershell command does not return the values needed\r\n- Fix Incorrect datetime value, which is because powershell command returns a datetime which is not supported in Java\r\n- Fix issue during backup restoration if VM has both ROOT and DATA disks.\r\n\r\nThis PR also has the following update\r\n- Add integration test

Description\r\nThe PR fixes the following tests which could produce non-deterministic/flaky pass/fail result\r\n`com.cloud.network.as.AutoScaleVmProfileVOTest#tstSetOtherDeployParamsForUpdate`\r\n`com.cloud.network.as.AutoScaleVmProfileVOTest#testCounterParamsForUpdate`\r\n\r\n### Setup:\r\nJava version: 11.0.20.1\r\nMaven version: 3.8.8\r\n\r\n### Test failure reproduction:\r\nThe tests compares the keys and values of hashmap (based on index) with hardcoded string and asserts if they are equal. However, the order of key value pairs within hashmap is not gauranteed. Hence the test can fail. This issue was verified using the [NonDex plugin](https://github.com/TestingResearchIllinois/NonDex).\r\n\r\n### Steps\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/apache/cloudstack.git\r\ncd cloudstack\r\nmvn install -pl engine/schema -am -DskipTests\r\nmvn -pl engine/schema edu.illinois:nondex-maven-plugin:2.1.1:nondex -Dtest=com.cloud.network.as.AutoScaleVmProfileVOTest#tstSetOtherDeployParamsForUpdate\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Root cause and fix\r\n\r\nTest Failue in Nondex Mode\r\n```\r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 0.068 s <<< FAILURE! - in com.cloud.network.as.AutoScaleVmProfileVOTest\r\n[ERROR] tstSetOtherDeployParamsForUpdate(com.cloud.network.as.AutoScaleVmProfileVOTest)  Time elapsed: 0.061 s  <<< FAILURE!\r\norg.junit.ComparisonFailure: expected:<[serviceofferingid]> but was:<[rootdisksize]>\r\n\tat com.cloud.network.as.AutoScaleVmProfileVOTest.tstSetOtherDeployParamsForUpdate(AutoScaleVmProfileVOTest.java:72)\r\n\r\n[INFO]\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO]\r\n[ERROR] Failures:\r\n[ERROR]   AutoScaleVmProfileVOTest.tstSetOtherDeployParamsForUpdate:72 expected:<[serviceofferingid]> but was:<[rootdisksize]>\r\n[INFO]\r\n```\r\nThe above error occurs when comparing the keys and values of a [Hashmap](https://github.com/kavvya97/cloudstack/blob/main/engine/schema/src/test/java/com/cloud/network/as/AutoScaleVmProfileVOTest.java#L64). The expected string is a hardcoded key/value pair. The actual string is derived by parsing the hashmap and get the key by index. The comparision fails in some cases because the hashmap does not maintain order of contents.\r\n\r\n### Fix\r\nThe Fix implements a custom method 'Contains pair' to check if `otherDeployParamsList` contains the specific key and value pairs. If the List contains the specific key value pairs, It return true. This ensures that assertion does not consider the order of contents in Hashmap.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [X] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\nThis code modifies only test files and should not affect anything in production\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nThe test passes when run with the NonDex tool after the implementation of the fix. (`mvn -pl engine/schema edu.illinois:nondex-maven-plugin:2.1.1:nondex -Dtest=com.cloud.network.as.AutoScaleVmProfileVOTest#tstSetOtherDeployParamsForUpdate`)\r\n\r\n#### How did you try to break this feature and the system with this change?\r\nThe change only creates a new test utility and calls it within a single test. Hence it should not affect any other code\r\n","created_at":"2023-11-15T18:23:50Z","updated_at":"2023-11-17T08:06:07Z","closed_at":"2023-11-17T08:05:59Z","merged_at":"2023-11-17T08:05:58Z","merge_commit_sha":"6eb04a86a6b63ea54eb983e47bee11e7ae22e036","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1153660422,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTUzNjYwNDIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:unit-test","name":"component:unit-test","color":"105787","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1391967979,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzkxOTY3OTc5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/Severity:Trivial","name":"Severity:Trivial","color":"e08888","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2531619915,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTMxNjE5OTE1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/complexity:trivial","name":"complexity:trivial","color":"c5def5","default":false,"description":"10

Description\r\n\r\nThe API  `scaleVirtualMachine`  requires the specification of both vCPU quantity and memory amount, resulting in an error if either was omitted. This means that if an operator wants to increase the quantity of vCPUs while maintaining the existing memory, they were obligate to provide the current memory value as well.\r\n\r\nAn alteration has been introduced to the API to allow operators to input only the parameters they intend to modify while retaining the current values for the rest.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement

Traced it to concurrent VM starts using the same template and the same host to copy.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the non deterministic behaviour of 2 tests. This happens as the tests assume the return value of an API to be ordered when it is actually not guaranteed. This has been detected using [NonDex](https://github.com/TestingResearchIllinois/NonDex) tool.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction of issue\r\n1. `mvn install -pl plugins/network-elements/tungsten`\r\n2. `mvn -pl plugins/network-elements/tungsten edu.illinois:nondex-maven-plugin:2.1.1:nondex -Dtest=org.apache.cloudstack.network.tungsten.service.TungstenApiTest#listTungstenNetworkTest -DnondexMode=ONE`\r\n\r\nFailure log:\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Running org.apache.cloudstack.network.tungsten.service.TungstenApiTest\r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 77, Failures: 2, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 1.35 s <<< FAILURE! - in org.apache.cloudstack.network.tungsten.service.TungstenApiTest\r\n[ERROR] listTungstenNetworkTest(org.apache.cloudstack.network.tungsten.service.TungstenApiTest)  Time elapsed: 0.007 s  <<< FAILURE!\r\njava.lang.AssertionError: expected:<[net.juniper.tungsten.api.types.VirtualNetwork@6bab2585, net.juniper.tungsten.api.types.VirtualNetwork@74bdc168]> but was:<[net.juniper.tungsten.api.types.VirtualNetwork@74bdc168, net.juniper.tungsten.api.types.VirtualNetwork@6bab2585]>\r\n\tat org.apache.cloudstack.network.tungsten.service.TungstenApiTest.listTungstenNetworkTest(TungstenApiTest.java:1387)\r\n\r\n[ERROR] listTungstenPolicyTest(org.apache.cloudstack.network.tungsten.service.TungstenApiTest)  Time elapsed: 0.002 s  <<< FAILURE!\r\njava.lang.AssertionError: expected:<[net.juniper.tungsten.api.types.NetworkPolicy@59aa20b3, net.juniper.tungsten.api.types.NetworkPolicy@363f6148]> but was:<[net.juniper.tungsten.api.types.NetworkPolicy@363f6148, net.juniper.tungsten.api.types.NetworkPolicy@59aa20b3]>\r\n\tat org.apache.cloudstack.network.tungsten.service.TungstenApiTest.listTungstenPolicyTest(TungstenApiTest.java:1363)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Root cause\r\nThe test class `org.apache.cloudstack.network.tungsten.service.TungstenApiTest` uses [ApiConnectorMock](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/05b9b6e2e77b9b633f0fe22aff5f9f3c047b2303/plugins/network-elements/tungsten/src/test/java/org/apache/cloudstack/network/tungsten/service/TungstenApiTest.java#L98) for all tests. The tests `listTungstenNetworkTest`, `listTungstenPolicyTest` use the `list` method of this connector [Tungsten API connector call](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/main/plugins/network-elements/tungsten/src/main/java/org/apache/cloudstack/network/tungsten/service/TungstenApi.java#L2065) in their respective [tests](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/05b9b6e2e77b9b633f0fe22aff5f9f3c047b2303/plugins/network-elements/tungsten/src/test/java/org/apache/cloudstack/network/tungsten/service/TungstenApiTest.java#L1362-L1385).\r\n \r\nThe 3rd party library [juniper-tungsten-api](https://github.com/radu-todirica/tungsten-api/tree/master/net/juniper/tungsten/juniper-tungsten-api/2.0)'s `net.juniper.tungsten.api.ApiConnectorMock`'s `list` method does guarantee the ordering of results. Unfortunately, the source code is not on github for direct inspection. Upon downloading and decompiling the `juniper-tungsten-api-2.0.jar`, it can be seen that this method uses `HashMap.values()` which is unordered, for the population of the returned list. A screenshot has been added below. Decompilation was done using [Java-decompiler](http://www.javadecompilers.com). \r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/rRajivramachandran/cloudstack/assets/22187598/a3d2e4dc-fead-4d29-aa10-b6adfbea9eb4)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Fix\r\nThe test class already defines a comparator to sort objects of `ApiObjectBase` [here](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/main/plugins/network-elements/tungsten/src/test/java/org/apache/cloudstack/network/tungsten/service/TungstenApiTest.java#L93). This has been used to ensure consistent test behaviour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n- All tests in the test class pass(`mvn -pl plugins/network-elements/tungsten test -Dtest=org.apache.cloudstack.network.tungsten.service.TungstenApiTest`)\r\n- All tests in test class pass when run with nondex(`mvn -pl plugins/network-elements/tungsten edu.illinois:nondex-maven-plugin:2.1.1:nondex -Dtest=org.apache.cloudstack.network.tungsten.service.TungstenApiTest`)\r\n\r\n#### How did you try to break this feature and the system with this change?\r\n\r\nThe change only touches test files and not source code.

Description\r\n\r\nWhen using the Usage and Quota plugins, operators must deal with 4 different timezone configurations:\r\n\r\n- A: the global setting `usage.execution.timezone`;\r\n- B: the global setting `usage.aggregation.timezone`;\r\n- C: the timezone of the operating system;\r\n- D: the timezone of the database (GMT).\r\n\r\nThese configurations are used by the Usage and Quota plugins in the following way:\r\n- `A` defines the timezone of the job's execution; \r\n- `B` defines the timezone of validations performed during the execution of the job;\r\n- Dates are written in logs and messages according to `C`;\r\n- Data is stored in the database according to `D`.\r\n\r\nHandling these multiple timezones can lead to confusion when examining logs and data. To simplify this complexity, this PR adjusts the logs and exception messages of the Usage and Quota plugins. Now, dates are displayed according to the appropriate configuration for each situation: `usage.aggregation.timezone` for messages related to data processing and APIs, and `usage.execution.timezone` for logs related to job scheduling. This modification reduces the number of timezone configurations operators need to manage to 3.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [X] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nIn a server in GMT+8, I set `usage.execution.timezone` to GMT+8 and `usage.aggregation.timezone` to GMT+11. Then, I verified that the logs and the APIs displayed dates according to the timezone configurations:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n024-01-24 02:45:49,079 DEBUG [o.a.c.q.QuotaManagerImpl] (qtp391630194-19:ctx-f8be50a5 ctx-65a023c1) (logid:4347e9c1) Validating usage record [{\"id\":30567,\"usageId\":38,\"usageType\":2,\"startDate\":\"2024-01-24T04:00:00+1100\",\"endDate\":\"2024-01-24T04:59:59+1100\"}] for {\"accountName\":\"admin\",\"domainId\":1,\"id\":2,\"uuid\":\"b88e1a97-771e-11ee-8e59-5254003754dc\"} against [1] quota tariffs.\r\n2024-01-24 02:45:49,081 DEBUG [o.a.c.q.QuotaManagerImpl] (qtp391630194-19:ctx-f8be50a5 ctx-65a023c1) (logid:4347e9c1) Quota tariff [{\"name\":\"ALLOCATED_VM\",\"usageName\":\"ALLOCATED_VM\",\"uuid\":\"9f3f1434-771e-11ee-8e59-5254003754dc\",\"startDate\":\"2010-05-04T11:00:00+1100\",\"endDate\":\"null\"}] does not have an activation rule, therefore we will use the quota tariff value [0.00000] in the calculation.\r\n2024-01-24 02:45:49,081 DEBUG [o.a.c.q.QuotaManagerImpl] (qtp391630194-19:ctx-f8be50a5 ctx-65a023c1) (logid:4347e9c1) The aggregation of the quota tariffs resulted in the value [0.00000] for the usage record [{\"id\":30567,\"usageId\":38,\"usageType\":2,\"startDate\":\"2024-01-24T04:00:00+1100\",\"endDate\":\"2024-01-24T04:59:59+1100\"}].

Description\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen there is outage in storage API coincides with a VM start, the volume could be stuck in \"Allocated\" state but with a pool Id assigned in DB. It blocked the ability to start the VM  during planDeployment process,  in the method storagePoolCompatibleWithVolumePool() shown below when validating a volume with a storage pool, if the volume's pool Id is not null and state is Allocated, it would always return false for any storage pools. As a result, the allocator cannot find a suitable pool and it blocks the VM start process.\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n@Override\r\n    public boolean storagePoolCompatibleWithVolumePool(StoragePool pool, Volume volume) {\r\n        if (pool == null || volume == null) {\r\n            return false;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        if (volume.getPoolId() == null) {\r\n            // Volume is not allocated to any pool.

Before DeploymentPlanningManager is trying to find suitable storage pools for volumes, if any volume is in Allocated state with a pool ID, the pool id will be cleared.\r\n**Testing**\r\nFor a stopped VM, manually updated its root volume state to \"Allocated\" with a pool ID.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR splits the test_vm_life_cycle.py test file and cleans some of the conditional test skipping. This all in an attempt to reduce intermittent integration test failures.\r\n\r\nThe reason is that a lot of tests are not basic life cycle tests and differnt failures on different platform are mostly pre-conditional instead of genuine positives.\r\n\r\nDuring this work I also noticed that we might gain by eliminating tests as it seems a lot of the same functionalities are tested at different locations.

This issue was verified using the [NonDex plugin](https://github.com/TestingResearchIllinois/NonDex). \r\n\r\n#### Steps:\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/apache/cloudstack.git\r\ncd cloudstack\r\nmvn install -pl plugins/network-elements/nicira-nvp -am -DskipTests\r\nmvn -pl plugins/network-elements/nicira-nvp edu.illinois:nondex-maven-plugin:2.1.1:nondex -Dtest=com.cloud.network.nicira.NiciraRestClientTest#testExecuteLiveLockWhenControllerAllowsLoginAndFollowsWithUnauthorizedButDoesNotRediect\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Root cause and fix:\r\n\r\nTest failure in NonDex mode:\r\n```\r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 1, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 1.767 s <<< FAILURE! - in com.cloud.network.nicira.NiciraRestClientTest\r\n[ERROR] testExecuteLiveLockWhenControllerAllowsLoginAndFollowsWithUnauthorizedButDoesNotRediect(com.cloud.network.nicira.NiciraRestClientTest)  Time elapsed: 1.761 s  <<< ERROR!\r\njava.lang.NullPointerException\r\n```\r\n  \r\nThe NullPointerException occurs at the following location \r\nhttps://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/fcbf540369d5d51145573dc948e21930531a3fad/plugins/network-elements/nicira-nvp/src/main/java/com/cloud/network/nicira/NiciraRestClient.java#L87\r\n\r\nbecause the `mockResponse` created in the test, does not get returned for the `execute` method.\r\n\r\nThe `HttpRequestMatcher` serializes the request object to a string\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/fcbf540369d5d51145573dc948e21930531a3fad/utils/src/test/java/com/cloud/utils/rest/HttpRequestMatcher.java#L68 \r\n\r\nTo verify that the issue was due to the HttpRequestMatcher used by mockito, the following line: \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/fcbf540369d5d51145573dc948e21930531a3fad/plugins/network-elements/nicira-nvp/src/test/java/com/cloud/network/nicira/NiciraRestClientTest.java#L190  \r\n\r\nwas modfied to read `when(httpClient.execute(eq(HTTP_HOST), any(HttpUriRequest.class), eq(httpClientContext)))`.   \r\n\r\nThis allows matching any request class object. The test passed with this change when run on the NonDex tool confirming that the issue was here.\r\n\r\nOn adding logs to the `HttpRequestMatcher` class, it was deduced that the test fails when the order of keys returned by the login parameters is not the same as that configured in the test class.\r\n\r\nFailing case(ordered shuffled):\r\n\r\n```\r\n2023-10-19 18:11:15,312 ERROR [root] (main:) Wanted payload:password=adminpassword&username=admin\r\n2023-10-19 18:11:15,312 ERROR [root] (main:) Actual payload:username=admin&password=adminpassword\r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 1, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 1.423 s <<< FAILURE! - in com.cloud.network.nicira.NiciraRestClientTest\r\n[ERROR] testExecuteLiveLockWhenControllerAllowsLoginAndFollowsWithUnauthorizedButDoesNotRediect(com.cloud.network.nicira.NiciraRestClientTest)  Time elapsed: 1.413 s  <<< ERROR!\r\njava.lang.NullPointerException\r\n```\r\n\r\nPassing case(order not shuffled):\r\n\r\n```\r\n2023-10-19 18:11:09,513 ERROR [root] (main:) Wanted payload:username=admin&password=adminpassword\r\n2023-10-19 18:11:09,517 ERROR [root] (main:) Actual payload:username=admin&password=adminpassword\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 1.968 s - in com.cloud.network.nicira.NiciraRestClientTest\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe test class configures login parameters here: \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/fcbf540369d5d51145573dc948e21930531a3fad/plugins/network-elements/nicira-nvp/src/test/java/com/cloud/network/nicira/NiciraRestClientTest.java#L82-L93\r\n\r\nand the source code builds them here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/fcbf540369d5d51145573dc948e21930531a3fad/plugins/network-elements/nicira-nvp/src/main/java/com/cloud/network/nicira/NiciraRestClient.java#L122-L131 \r\n\r\n### Fix\r\nTo make the map ordered for ensuring deterministic results during serialization/deserialization, changes were done at the source code and test by converting the `HashMap` to a `LinkedHashMap`. \r\n \r\n### Additional fixes\r\nThe change also fixed following tests in the same class which were flaky due to the same reason:\r\n- com.cloud.network.nicira.NiciraRestClientTest#testExecuteTwoConsecutiveUnauthorizedExecutions\r\n- com.cloud.network.nicira.NiciraRestClientTest#testExecuteUnauthorizedThenSuccess\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\nThe fix is backward compatible as it merely changes an unordered map implementation to an ordered one for ensuring that when string serialization of the map is done, results are deterministic.\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\n- The test passes when run with the NonDex tool(`mvn -pl plugins/network-elements/nicira-nvp edu.illinois:nondex-maven-plugin:2.1.1:nondex -Dtest=com.cloud.network.nicira.NiciraRestClientTest#testExecuteLiveLockWhenControllerAllowsLoginAndFollowsWithUnauthorizedButDoesNotRediect`). \r\n- The entire test suite of the module passes(`mvn -pl plugins/network-elements/nicira-nvp test`).\r\n \r\n#### How did you try to break this feature and the system with this change?\r\nThe change does not affect any feature as it only makes an unordered data structured as ordered. This does not enforce any constraints on source code and is an internal implementation detail. However it makes the code more deterministic in cases where serialization to strings is done directly, which is the case for some tests \r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the

Description\r\n\r\nThe PR fixes the following test which could produce non-deterministic/flaky pass/fail result\r\n`com.cloud.server.StatsCollectorTest.java#persistVirtualMachineStatsTestPersistsSuccessfully`\r\n\r\n### Setup:\r\n\r\nJava version: 11.0.20.1  \r\nMaven version: 3.8.8   \r\n\r\n### Test failure reproduction:  \r\nThe test `com.cloud.server.StatsCollectorTest.java#persistVirtualMachineStatsTestPersistsSuccessfully` compares two JSON Strings and asserts if they are equal. However, the order of key value pairs is not guaranteed in a JSON string. Hence the test can fail. This issue was verified using the [NonDex plugin](https://github.com/TestingResearchIllinois/NonDex). \r\n\r\n#### Steps:\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/apache/cloudstack.git\r\ncd cloudstack\r\nmvn install -pl server -am -DskipTests\r\nmvn -pl server edu.illinois:nondex-maven-plugin:2.1.1:nondex -Dtest=com.cloud.server.StatsCollectorTest.java#persistVirtualMachineStatsTestPersistsSuccessfully\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Root cause and Fix\r\nTest Failure in Nondex Mode\r\n```\r\nResults:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Failures: \r\n[ERROR]   StatsCollectorTest.persistVirtualMachineStatsTestPersistsSuccessfully:335 expected:<{\"vmId\":2,\"[cpuUtilization\":6.0,\"networkReadKBs\":7.0,\"networkWriteKBs\":8.0,\"diskReadIOs\":12.0,\"diskWriteIOs\":13.0,\"diskReadKBs\":10.0,\"diskWriteKBs\":11.0,\"memoryKBs\":3.0,\"intFreeMemoryKBs\":4.0,\"targetMemoryKBs\":5.0,\"numCPUs\":9,\"entityType\":\"vm\"]}> but was:<{\"vmId\":2,\"[networkWriteKBs\":8.0,\"memoryKBs\":3.0,\"entityType\":\"vm\",\"cpuUtilization\":6.0,\"diskReadKBs\":10.0,\"networkReadKBs\":7.0,\"diskReadIOs\":12.0,\"targetMemoryKBs\":5.0,\"numCPUs\":9,\"intFreeMemoryKBs\":4.0,\"diskWriteIOs\":13.0,\"diskWriteKBs\":11.0]}>\r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n```\r\nThe following error occurs when comparing two json strings in this [line](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/99ded8169beef89a664df7580b2f039569491172/server/src/test/java/com/cloud/server/StatsCollectorTest.java#L333). The expected string is a hardcoded json string. The actual string is obtained by converting the class attributes to JSON(using the Gson library) [here](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/99ded8169beef89a664df7580b2f039569491172/server/src/main/java/com/cloud/server/StatsCollector.java#L1900). The comparision fails in some cases since the key orderings between the JSON data could be different. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Fix\r\nThe Fix converts both the JSON strings to TreeMaps(which maintain key order) and compares these for equality. This makes the test more stable without losing out on effectiveness\r\n\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\nThis code modifies only test files and should not affect anything in production\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n- The test passes when run with the NonDex tool. (`mvn -pl server edu.illinois:nondex-maven-plugin:2.1.1:nondex -Dtest=com.cloud.server.StatsCollectorTest.java#persistVirtualMachineStatsTestPersistsSuccessfully`)\r\n- The entire test suite of the module passes. (`mvn -pl server test`)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### How did you try to break this feature and the system with this change?\r\nThe change only creates a new test utility and calls it within a single test.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR ensures that the resource counts are not decremented twice for a running VM while unmanaging.\r\nCurrently, the code does the same operation for a non-stopped VM twice. This could lead to resource count discrepancy for an account or domain.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nBefore fix:\r\n- Create an account\r\n- Deploy a VM for that account\r\n- Observe the account limits and count\r\n- Unmanage the VM\r\n- Again observe the account limits and count. There will be some negative values for VM, CPU and memory as the resource counts have been decremented twice\r\n\r\n```\r\n(localcloud) 🐱 > list virtualmachines account=ACSuser\r\n{\r\n  \"count\":

release 2.5.2.0 are located at:\n<a href=\"https://github.com/ESAPI/esapi-java-legacy/blob/develop/documentation/esapi4java-core-2.5.2.0-release-notes.txt\">https://github.com/ESAPI/esapi-java-legacy/blob/develop/documentation/esapi4java-core-2.5.2.0-release-notes.txt</a></p>\n<h3>Configuration files located in configuration jar</h3>\n<p>Note that the attached file &quot;<strong>esapi-2.5.2.0-configuration.jar</strong>&quot; contains the default ESAPI configuration files intended for used in production. Download the file and unjar it via 'jar xf'. After you unjar that configuration jar, look under the 'configuration/' directory. Most of the files you are interested in are located under 'configuration/esapi', such as ESAPI.properties, validation.properties, etc. The attached file &quot;esapi-2.5.2.0-configuration.jar.asc&quot; is a detached GPG signature of that the file &quot;esapi-2.5.2.0-configuration.jar&quot; that was signed by ESAPI project co-lead, Kevin W. Wall.</p>\n<h3>CVEs addressed</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>CVE-2023-24998 was remediated.

It is made available via <code>Encoder.encodeForJSON()</code>. (Note unlike other encoders, there is no corresponding decoder (i.e., <code>decodeForJSON()</code>) made available. Since that would normally be done by your JavaScript code, it wasn't deemed essential.</li>\n<li>Executing 'mvn site' now creates Javadoc for the ESAPI tag library (GitHub issue <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/ESAPI/esapi-java-legacy/issues/733\">#733</a>).</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Details</h3>\n<p>For full details, please see the release notes for ESAPI release 2.5.1.0 located at:\n<a href=\"https://github.com/ESAPI/esapi-java-legacy/blob/develop/documentation/esapi4java-core-2.5.1.0-release-notes.txt\">https://github.com/ESAPI/esapi-java-legacy/blob/develop/documentation/esapi4java-core-2.5.1.0-release-notes.txt</a></p>\n<p>Note the file &quot;esapi-2.5.1.0-configuration.jar&quot; contains the default ESAPI configuration files under 'configuration/' (ESAPI.properties, validation.properties, etc.) and the file &quot;esapi-2.5.1.0-configuration.jar.asc&quot; is a GPG signature of that jar file made by 'Kevin W.

If your ESAPI.Logger property is set to use Log4J and you do not change it, you will get obscure Exceptions or Errors thrown. (Generally an <code>ExceptionInInitializerError</code>.)</li>\n<li>Because we've upgraded to AntiSamy 1.7.0, there are also some potentially breaking changes in this release if you have customized your antisamy-esapi.xml file.</li>\n<li>As begun in the previous release, this release only supports Java 8 or later.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you do nothing else at least read this short &quot;<a href=\"https://github.com/ESAPI/esapi-java-legacy/blob/develop/documentation/esapi4java-core-2.5.0.0-release-notes.txt#L70\">Changes Requiring Special Attention</a>&quot; section of the 2.5.0.0 release notes. You have been warned!</p>\n<p>Finally, note that the file &quot;esapi-2.5.0.0-configuration.jar&quot; (see below) contains the default ESAPI configuration files under 'configuration/' (ESAPI.properties, validation.properties, etc.) and the file &quot;esapi-2.5.0.0-configuration.jar.asc&quot; is a GPG signature of that jar file made by 'Kevin W.

Java 8 or later is required to use this version of ESAPI. The ESAPi 2.3.0.0 release was the last release to support Java 7.</li>\n<li>This release of ESAPI fixes an older DoS vulnerability (CVE-2022-28366) that we were unable to patch while supporting Java 7 as the minimal JDK, as well as a newer DoS vulnerability (CVE-2022-29546) that previously did not have a CVE ID during our 2.3.0.0 release. ESAPI users might have seen either of these DoS vulnerabilities manifested via <code>Validator.isValidSafeHTML()</code> and <code>Validator.getValidSafeHTML()</code> in previous releases.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...
