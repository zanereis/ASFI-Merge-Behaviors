[GROOVY-9197](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GROOVY-9197): Java 10+ compatibility of groovyc ant task\r\n\r\nThe design of this change is to pass separately the paths necessary for groovyc to run and the classpath of the compiled artifacts.  The `-classpath` argument was previously populated with groovy-all, etc.  Now this stuff is passed via the `--classpath` argument to `FileSystemCompilerFacade`.  Thus, no special `URLClassLoader` interaction is required (which fails under Java 11).\r\n```\r\n  [compile] Compilation arguments:\r\n  [compile] C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk\\11.0.5\\bin\\java\r\n  [compile] -classpath\r\n  [compile] <enough to execute FileSystemCompilerFacade>\r\n  [compile] -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8\r\n  [compile] org.codehaus.groovy.ant.FileSystemCompilerFacade\r\n  [compile] --classpath\r\n  [compile] <compilation classpath>\r\n  [compile] -j\r\n  [compile] -Fg\r\n  [compile] -Jsource=1.8\r\n  [compile] -Jtarget=1.8\r\n  [compile] -d\r\n  [compile] <output directory>\r\n  [compile] --configscript\r\n  [compile] config.groovy\r\n  [compile] <source files to compile>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe trick to doing all of this is determining what the bootstrap classpath for `FileSystemCompilerFacade` should be.  At the moment, I am getting the Ant runtime from `AntClassLoader`.  But this should be reduced to just `groovy` and `groovy-ant`.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    private void doForkCommandLineList(List<String> commandLineList, Path classpath, String separator) {\r\n        //commandLineList.add(\"java\");\r\n\r\n        // TODO: Need some help to complete this!  Is it safe to get codesource of FileSystemCompilerFacade.class?\r\n        ClassLoader parent = getClass().getClassLoader();\r\n        if (parent instanceof AntClassLoader) {\r\n            commandLineList.add(\"-classpath\");\r\n            commandLineList.add(((AntClassLoader) parent).getClasspath());\r\n        } else {\r\n            // TODO: add enough classpath entries to support execution of FileSystemCompilerFacade\r\n            throw new AssertionError(\"not yet implemented\");\r\n        }\r\n```","created_at":"2019-11-11T21:24:46Z","updated_at":"2019-11-16T14:58:49Z","closed_at":"2019-11-15T11:00:06Z","merged_at":"2019-11-15T11:00:06Z","merge_commit_sha":"c6e50bab27dc705116b93daccd62d53160c99938","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/1080/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/1080/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/1080/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/statuses/453012fab9b3df43264d9c0b193006e11db1968a","head":{"label":"apache:GROOVY-9197","ref":"GROOVY-9197","sha":"453012fab9b3df43264d9c0b193006e11db1968a","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34039690,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDAzOTY5MA==","name":"groovy","full_name":"apache/groovy","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy","description":"Apache
