the first/last string aggregator's `getComparator` method (used in topN ranking, grouping by ordering, post agg ordering) compares two aggregator values on `__time` first and then on values. This change makes that comparator to compare only on values which is the correct behavior. The numerical first/last aggregators already compare on the values.\r\n\r\nThe current users who are ordering their results on the string first/last aggregator would need to augment their queries a `max(timeCol)` aggreagtor to achieve the same results.\r\nFor instance, a query like `SELECT stringCol2, LATEST(stringCol, 1024) as lat FROM table GROUP BY stringCol2 ORDER BY lat` would need to be rewritten as `SELECT stringCol2, LATEST(stringCol, 1024) as lat FROM table GROUP BY stringCol2 ORDER BY MAX(timeCol)`\r\n\r\nThe ingestion ordering is kept as is it since it doesn't impact the query results.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

and selector dictionary sizes currently both default to 100MB.\r\nThis is not optimal, because it can lead to OOM on small servers and\r\ninsufficient resource utilization on larger servers. It also invites\r\nend users to try to tune it when queries run out of dictionary space,\r\nwhich can make things worse if the end user sets it to too high.\r\n\r\nSo, this patch:\r\n\r\n- Adds automatic tuning for selector and merge dictionaries. Selectors\r\n  use up to 10% of the heap and merge buffers use up to 30% of the heap\r\n  (aggregate across all queries).\r\n\r\n- Updates out-of-memory error messages to emphasize enabling disk\r\n  spilling vs. increasing memory parameters. With the memory parameters\r\n  automatically sized, it is more likely that an end user will get\r\n  benefit from enabling disk spilling.\r\n\r\n- Removes the query context parameters that allow lowering of configured\r\n  dictionary sizes. These complicate the calculation, and I don't see a\r\n  reasonable use case for them.","created_at":"2022-07-09T03:39:26Z","updated_at":"2022-08-26T08:09:55Z","closed_at":"2022-07-11T15:20:50Z","merged_at":"2022-07-11T15:20:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"97207cdcc7c8445bd3875bae0c41e5d2c0c9b082","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":145651458,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDU2NTE0NTg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Ease%20of%20Use","name":"Ease of Use","color":"006b75","default":false,"description":null},{"id":219585748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODU3NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Querying","name":"Area - Querying","color":"fef2c0","default":false,"description":null},{"id":297508895,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyOTc1MDg4OTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Release%20Notes","name":"Release Notes","color":"006b75","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/46","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/milestone/46","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/46/labels","id":8348738,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAGEErM4Af2RC","number":46,"title":"24.0.0","description":"Druid 24.0.0 release.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR implements the functionality described in #12695. This design is the result of collaboration between myself and @cheddar over the past several months and we've iterated on it a few times (you might notice the column version is 3 for example, despite there only being 1 implementation). We are now confident enough about the viability of this approach to release it into the wild. There is a still _a lot_ of work to do, but I think this is now at a pretty good jumping off point, and has built some pieces that might have some wider use cases which I'll try to get into later.\r\n\r\nSince #12695 describes the high level design, here I will just dig straight into implementation details.\r\n\r\n### Ingestion\r\n\r\n#### `NestedDataDimensionSchema`, `NestedDataDimensionHandler`\r\n`NestedDataDimensionSchema` is the native ingest `DimensionSchema` that is used to specify nested data columns, specified in JSON as\r\n```json\r\n{ \"type\": \"json\", \"name\": \"nestedColumnName\" }\r\n```\r\n`NestedDataDimensionHandler` is registered as the `DimensionHandler` for the `json` complex type so that the proper indexer and mergers can be created to process the values during ingestion.\r\n\r\n#### `NestedDataColumnIndexer`, `StructuredData`\r\nThe `NestedDataColumnIndexer` is the `DimensionIndexer` for nested data columns which deals in a type called `StructuredData`, which is basically a wrapper around any java object that provides some niceness for operating on it and persisting to columns and the like. `NestedDataColumnIndexer` job is to process any type of input, traverse its structure to locate any 'literal' fields to construct a super set of all nested columns, and to construct a 'global' value dictionary of every literal value that is encountered while processing input.\r\n\r\n#### `NestedDataColumnMerger`, `NestedDataColumnSerializer`\r\n`NestedDataColumnMerger` is the `DimensionMergerV9` implementation, which is responsible for merging and sorting the global dimension dictionary and constructing `NestedDataColumnSerializer` which is a `Serializer` implementation which then does the bulk of the work creating the segment. `NestedDataColumnSerializer` with the set of fields and their types, along with the sorted global dictionary can now write out the actual column. It maintains a `GlobalDictionaryEncodedFieldColumnWriter` for each nested field, which are responsible for writing the nested columns themselves. While `NestedDataColumnSerializer` is serializing the 'raw' complex column also processes the data to feed values to `GlobalDictionaryEncodedFieldColumnWriter` which build 'local' dictionaries that map the values contained within the nested column to the global ids and write out an intermediary column of these unsorted local ids. After the 'raw' column is fully serialized, the nested columns created by `GlobalDictionaryEncodedFieldColumnWriter` can now also be finalized, which go through a similar process of sorting their local dictionaries, then build bitmap indexes for the local values and write out compressed value columns. For columns which are a single numeric type, the writer will also persist a long or double value column as appropriate.\r\n\r\n### Segment\r\n#### `NestedDataComplexTypeSerde`, `NestedDataColumnSupplier`, `NestedDataComplexColumn`, `NestedFieldLiteralDictionaryEncodedColumn`\r\nAfter serialization, the segment is left with a `NestedDataComplexColumn`, which is the `ComplexColumn` implementation that is used to read the 'raw' data out of the column when queried directly. `NestedDataComplexTypeSerde` is the `ComplexMetricsSerde` that ties `NestedDataColumnSupplier` to `COMPLEX<json>`. `NestedDataComplexColumn` also provides mechanisms to read the nested literal columns, and maintains a column cache of these columns so that they can be closed when the complex column itself is closed. These nested columns are all of the type `NestedFieldLiteralDictionaryEncodedColumn`, which are dictionary encoded with the local to global value dictionaries, and if single typed numeric, also contain a numeric value column.\r\n\r\n### Querying\r\n\r\n#### `NestedFieldVirtualColumn`, `NestedFieldLiteralColumnIndexSupplier`\r\n`NestedFieldVirtualColumn` is a specialized `VirtualColumn` that can be used to create column selectors for the `NestedFieldLiteralDictionaryEncodedColumn` that are associated with the `NestedDataComplexColumn`, and is used by the `JSON_VALUE` SQL function to provide fast queries to avoid resorting to processing the 'raw' nested data, and `JSON_QUERY` to have direct access to the raw data column. `NestedFieldLiteralColumnIndexSupplier` is the `ColumnIndexSupplier` which allows `NestedFieldLiteralColumnIndexSupplier` to utilize the bitmap indexes of the `NestedFieldLiteralDictionaryEncodedColumn` used by `JSON_VALUE` for fast filtering.\r\n\r\n#### Native Expressions\r\nTo fill in additional functionality, a number of additional native Druid expressions have been added:\r\n\r\n| function | notes |\r\n|---|---|\r\n| `json_value(expr, path)` | Extract a Druid literal (`STRING`, `LONG`, `DOUBLE`) value from a `COMPLEX<json>` column or input `expr` using JSONPath syntax of `path` |\r\n| `json_query(expr, path)` | Extract a `COMPLEX<json>` value from a `COMPLEX<json>` column or input `expr` using JSONPath syntax of `path` |\r\n| `json_object(expr1, expr2[, expr3, expr4 ...])` | Construct a `COMPLEX<json>` with alternating 'key' and 'value' arguments|\r\n| `parse_json(expr)` | Deserialize a JSON `STRING` into a `COMPLEX<json>` to be used with expressions which operate on `COMPLEX<json>` inputs. |\r\n| `to_json(expr)` | Convert any input type to `COMPLEX<json>` to be used with expressions which operate on `COMPLEX<json>` inputs, like a `CAST` operation (rather than deserializing `STRING` values like `PARSE_JSON`) |\r\n| `to_json_string(expr)` | Convert a `COMPLEX<json>` input into a JSON `STRING` value |\r\n| `json_keys(expr, path)`| get array of field names in `expr` at the specified JSONPath `path`, or null if the data does not exist or have any fields |\r\n| `json_paths(expr)` | get array of all JSONPath paths available in `expr` |\r\n\r\n\r\n#### SQL Functions\r\nThe `NestedFieldVirtualColumn` and the expressions are wired up as SQL operators. `JSON_VALUE` and `JSON_QUERY` plan to `NestedFieldVirtualColumn` whenever the input is a `COMPLEX<json>` column, anything else plans into an `ExpressionVirtualColumn` for the associated native expressions.\r\n\r\n| function | notes |\r\n|---|---|\r\n| `JSON_VALUE(expr, path [RETURNING sqltype])` | Extract a Druid literal (`STRING`, `LONG`, `DOUBLE`) value from a `COMPLEX<json>` column or input `expr` using JSONPath syntax of `path`. The optional `RETURNING sqltype` syntax allows suggesting the type of the nested literal to be extracted from a `COMPLEX<json>` column, and if not present type will attempted to be determined from context before falling back to considering the output as `VARCHAR`. |\r\n| `JSON_QUERY(expr, path)` | Extract a `COMPLEX<json>` value from a `COMPLEX<json>` column or input `expr` using JSONPath syntax of `path` |\r\n| `JSON_OBJECT(KEY expr1 VALUE expr2[, KEY expr3 VALUE expr4 ...])` | Construct a `COMPLEX<json>` storing the results of `VALUE` expressions at `KEY` expressions |\r\n| `PARSE_JSON(expr)` | Deserialize a JSON `STRING` into a `COMPLEX<json>` to be used with expressions which operate on `COMPLEX<json>` inputs. |\r\n| `TO_JSON(expr)` | Convert any input type to `COMPLEX<json>` to be used with expressions which operate on `COMPLEX<json>` inputs, like a `CAST` operation (rather than deserializing `STRING` values like `PARSE_JSON`) |\r\n| `TO_JSON_STRING(expr)` | Convert a `COMPLEX<json>` input into a JSON `STRING` value |\r\n| `JSON_KEYS(expr, path)`| get array of field names in `expr` at the specified JSONPath `path`, or null if the data does not exist or have any fields |\r\n| `JSON_PATHS(expr)` | get array of all JSONPath paths available in `expr` |\r\n\r\n\r\n### Other notable parts\r\n\r\n#### `NestedPathFinder`, `StructuredDataProcessor`\r\nOut of worry that using an off the shelf library for parsing path expressions would be too slow, I ended up writing my own JSONPath parser inside `NestedPathFinder` that supports the small subset of functionality that we needed and minimize overhead as much as possible. There is also code in there to parse 'jq' style paths, which is what my first prototype functions used, and is still accepted by the virtual column. Both are parsed into a `List<NestedPathPart>`, where `NestedPartPath` is either a `MapField` or an `ArrayElement`, and the sequence is processed in order to extract values from some object.\r\n\r\nProcessing of nested structure is done with `StructuredDataProcessor`, which provides mechanisms to dig through objects to do stuff. This is used at both ingest time to build the global dictionary, estimate sizes, and collect the superset of paths, and also by expressions which use it to perform the function such as extracting a value, collecting the list of keys at some path, etc.\r\n\r\n### Building blocks\r\n\r\n#### `FixedIndexed`\r\nLike `GenericIndexed` but for fixed width values so no 'offsets' are required to be stored since values offsets can be computed by index. This is used for both the long and double components of the global value dictionary, and each nested field column has a int `FixedIndexed` to store mapping of local dictionary id to global dictionary ids.\r\n\r\n#### `ComparatorDimensionDictionary`, `SortedComparatorDimensionDictionary`\r\n`Comparator` based version of `DimensionDictionary` and `SortedDimensionDictionary`. I might swap out these new ones for the current ones at some point in the future to standardize on using `Comparator` for comparison instead of `Comparable`.\r\n\r\n#### `CompressedBlockReader`, `CompressedBlockSerializer`\r\nModels a contiguous memory address space which is compressed into 64kb blocks (sized to the compression buffer pool). This is a sort of replacement for using `GenericIndexed` to store compressed blocks, without the baggage of `GenericIndexed`. It currently only supports being contained in a single smoosh file and so is limited to at most 2gb of compressed data, but in future work I would like to do would allow for splitting across multiple files.\r\n\r\n#### `CompressedVariableSizedBlobColumn`, `CompressedVariableSizedBlobColumnSupplier`, `CompressedVariableSizedBlobColumnSerializer`\r\nGeneric structure to store columns of variably sized compressed blobs, basically it stores a compressed set of longs corresponding to the 'end' offset of all of the values, and then the compressed blocks of data itself. This is built on top of a `CompressedBlockSerializer`/`CompressedBlockReader` and another new thing, `CompressedLongsReader`/`CompressedLongsWriter` that is itself _also_ built with `CompressedBlockSerializer`/`CompressedBlockReader` (instead of using existing `ColumnarLongs` implementations).\r\n\r\nThis is used to store the 'raw' json value of nested columns, and I could also see it being used to support compressed complex aggregators as an alternative to `GenericIndexedBasedComplexColumn` in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

by volume from #10407\r\n\r\nCurrently there is no way to know how much data is processed by task during ingestion. This PR adds ingest/events/processedBytes metric to emit number of bytes read since last emission time.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds InputStats class which is present in all task types and acts as holder for task level counts like processed bytes in this case. Thus standardized metrics throughout the task types can be added in future and emitted using InputStatsMonitor which is automatically initialized for all tasks\r\n\r\nThis PR provides convenient wrapper class named CountableInputEntity which can warp any InputEntity to count number of bytes processed through that InputEntity, thus its easier for new implementations to emit this metric just by wrapping the base input entity in this while creating InputEntityIteratingReader\r\n\r\nSince Kafka and Kinesis does not use InputEntity, therefore processed bytes is increment directly in SeekableStreamIndexTaskRunner as it has access to InputStats\r\n\r\nWith this is place, druid will be able to report throughput by volume\r\n\r\nThis is a work in progress. \r\n have updated the PR to have the monitor emitted correctly now.

we move towards query execution plans that involve more transfer\r\nof data between servers, it's important to have a data format that\r\nprovides for doing this more efficiently than the options available to\r\nus today.\r\n\r\nThis patch adds:\r\n\r\n- Columnar frames, which support fast querying. Writes are faster than\r\n  on the segment format. Querying is slower than equivalent operations\r\n  on the segment format, due to lack of indexes and due to various choices\r\n  intended to support fast writes as well reasonably fast reads. Benchmarks\r\n  below.\r\n- Row-based frames, which support fast sorting via memory comparison\r\n  and fast whole-row copies via memory copying.\r\n- Frame files, a container format that can be stored on disk or\r\n  transferred between servers.\r\n\r\nCentral classes:\r\n\r\n- [Frame](https://github.com/gianm/druid/blob/frames/processing/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/frame/Frame.java), a data frame.\r\n- [FrameWriters](https://github.com/gianm/druid/blob/frames/processing/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/frame/write/FrameWriters.java), entry point for writing frames.\r\n- [FrameReader](https://github.com/gianm/druid/blob/frames/processing/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/frame/read/FrameReader.java), entry point for reading frames.\r\n- [FrameFile](https://github.com/gianm/druid/blob/frames/processing/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/frame/file/FrameFile.java), a container format that holds many frames in a file or stream.\r\n- [FrameFileWriter](https://github.com/gianm/druid/blob/frames/processing/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/frame/file/FrameFileWriter.java), writer for frame files or streams.\r\n- [FrameStorageAdapter](https://github.com/gianm/druid/blob/frames/processing/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/frame/segment/FrameStorageAdapter.java), entry point for query engines to run on top of frames.\r\n\r\nThe code in this patch is not used in production yet. Therefore, the\r\npatch involves minimal changes outside of the `org.apache.druid.frame`\r\npackage.

Description\r\n\r\nFew indexing tasks register `RealtimeMetricsMonitor` or `TaskRealtimeMetricsMonitor` with the process’s `MonitorScheduler` when they start. These monitors never unregister themselves (they always `return true`, they'd need to `return false` to unregister). Each of these monitors emits a set of metrics once every `druid.monitoring.emissionPeriod`.\r\nAs a result, after executing several tasks for a while, Indexer emits metrics of these tasks even after they're long gone.\r\n\r\n#### Proposed Solution\r\n\r\nSince one should be able to obtain the last round of ingestion metrics after the task unregisters the monitor, introducing `lastRoundMetricsToBePushed` variable to keep track of the same and overriding the `AbstractMonitor.monitor` method in `RealtimeMetricsMonitor`, `TaskRealtimeMetricsMonitor` to implement the new logic.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects.

fixes #12692\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nDue to the race conditions described in [this comment](https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/12692#issuecomment-1166225796),\r\nthe ITPerfectRollupParallelBatchIndexTest and possibly other ITs can exhibit flaky behaviour.\r\nThis typically happens when the middle manager/indexer cleans up the partitions of a\r\nsupervisor task while a different peon is trying to list those partitions (to account for remaining\r\nspace in a storage location).\r\n\r\nThis PR tries to eliminate this behaviour by increasing the partition timeout, so that partitions are\r\neffectively not cleaned up during the course of the test, but only after.\r\n\r\nThis is not a permanent fix and a better fix would be improving the way the cleanup is handled\r\nbetween the peons and the middle manager.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n * Add `druid_worker_intermediaryPartitionTimeout = PT30M` in integration-test env configs\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR

As part of this we report the average num of rows in a segment and also a distribution of segments in predefined buckets. \r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing.

How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\n#### Adding metrics\r\nThe use of buckets was chosen because average wasn't good enough to understand the number of rows that are there in segments since its possible to have outliers and such. I looked into using min/max/median but that would involve too much memory keeping track of the number of rows in every segment for every datasource. Using buckets gives us a good idea of the distribution of rows in segments that only requires keeping track of a fixed number of values.\r\n\r\ndoing this at SegmentManager whenever we load or drop a segment allows for not counting the number of rows(which can be an expensive operation as it scans the segment) more than once. The downside to this is handling lazily loaded segments. These metrics will not make sense if lazy loading is enabled.\r\n\r\nWe chose to not handle lazy loading with this as it can be hard to understand if a segment is loaded 2x once lazily then actually how to keep track of that. And also it is hard to know if a dropped segment was originally lazy loaded or not. So instead this will throw an exception if `SegmentStatsMonitor` is enabled and `lazyLoadOnStart` is true\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects.

Description\r\nThis PR fixes an issue where datasources with no segments can become effectively stuck `DruidSchema` in a stale state if they are in the 'needs refresh' list after all segments have been removed. This meant that the datasource would be more or less permanently in `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES` until new segment activity takes place for such a datasource, which might be never if it was completely dropped, meaning the table would be present until the broker was restarted.\r\n\r\nThis is the source of the `ITBroadcastJoinQueryTest` flakiness, since depending on if the table was in the refresh list or not seemed to be the determining factor on whether or not the test flaked out or not. \r\n\r\nIn the failure case, the broker would have a log message like this:\r\n```\r\n2022-06-30T23:40:59,164 INFO [DruidSchema-Cache-0] org.apache.druid.sql.calcite.schema.DruidSchema - global dataSource [broadcast_join_wikipedia_test] has new signature: {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich was the clue I was looking for that trouble was afoot. There is probably an alternative way to fix this by removing stuff from the refresh list, but this way seemed to work well enough and ensures that we shouldn't ever run into stale tables by giving us another out to remove them.\r\n\r\nSince making this change I have been unable to trigger the failure locally, so will run through travis a few times to ensure it is indeed fixed. None of the changes made to `ITBroadcastJoinQueryTest` were in fact necessary, I just modified it to more aggressively drop the segments so that the test would run a little quicker rather than waiting on the load rules to drop them.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [x] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-01T05:10:03Z","updated_at":"2022-08-26T08:10:25Z","closed_at":"2022-07-02T01:54:01Z","merged_at":"2022-07-02T01:54:01Z","merge_commit_sha":"bbbb6e1c3f9ea52766fe0c330fe8e6d0249560a4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":690563172,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTA1NjMxNzI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20SQL","name":"Area - SQL","color":"fef2c0","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1048471070,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDQ4NDcxMDcw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Flaky%20test","name":"Flaky test","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/46","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/milestone/46","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/46/labels","id":8348738,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAGEErM4Af2RC","number":46,"title":"24.0.0","description":"Druid 24.0.0 release.

Description\r\n\r\nFixes one of the bugs reported in #12692 \r\n\r\nAs observed in [this comment](https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/12692#issuecomment-1166225796),\r\nthe expiry timeout is compared against the current time but the condition is reversed.\r\nThis means that as soon as a supervisor finishes, it gets cleaned up, irrespective of the specified\r\n`intermediaryPartitionTimeout` period.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n* Fix the condition\r\n* Add tests to verify the new correct behaviour\r\n* Reduce the default expiry timeout from P1D to PT5M\r\n   to retain current behaviour in case of default configs.\r\n\r\n### Upgrade effects\r\n\r\nOn upgrade, \r\n1. Clusters that have overridden `intermediaryPartitionCleanupPeriodSec`\r\n    but not `intermediaryPartitionTimeout` might notice intermediate data\r\n    from completed supervisors lingering for up to 5 more minutes.\r\n2. Clusters that have overridden `intermediaryPartitionTimeout` but not\r\n    `intermediaryPartitionCleanupPeriodSec` might notice intermediate data\r\n    lingering for up to the specified partition timeout duration (i.e. their partition\r\n    timeout will now start getting honored).\r\n3.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR. Remove this section if there is no corresponding issue. Don't reference the issue in the title of this pull-request. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are a committer, follow the PR action item checklist for committers:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/committer-instructions.md#pr-and-issue-action-item-checklist-for-committers. -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing. If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\nWe have a situation where our upstream mixed up PST vs UTC, but luckily the difference is always 8 hours (not taking into account Daylight Savings Time). And in a heterogeneous environment, sometimes you don't have control over the upstream setup.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, one of our ingestion always spans 2 days: today+8hours - tomorrow+8hours.\r\n\r\nIn this situation, we cannot use the following `segmentGranularities`: `DAY` or `SIX_HOUR`.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\nWithout this patch, we are forced to use `segmentGranularities: HOUR`, which is un-optimal. `EIGHT_HOUR` is the next best thing we can have.\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `Granularities`\r\n * `GranularityType`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

change allows for providing custom calcite rules from extensions to participate in query planning. The custom rules from extensions could be used to either do logical transformations for a query plan (some org specific optimization or experiment through a custom extension) or physical transformations (custom native query planning).\r\n\r\nFor adding a custom rule, the extension will require an implementation of `DruidExtensionCalciteRuleProvider` which will provide the custom rule.

#12636 amends Druid to make a single pass through the Calcite planner. This was originally done in support of the catalog project to avoid resolving the same catalog object multiple times, which could encounter race conditions if the resolutions occurred on either side of a change to the catalog.\r\n\r\nWhile discussing that change, @clintropolis called our attention to the \"query optimized\" way that Druid handles parameters, which then raised questions about how we ensure the proposed changes do not break our JDBC support. @gianm suggested we focus testing on JDBC.\r\n\r\nThat testing revealed that Druid's implementation of the JDBC protocol is a bit off, which may have led to some of the confusion around when to prepare and when to expect parameters. [Issue #12682](https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/12682) and [issue #12684](https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/12684) spell out the gaps.\r\n\r\nWhile JDBC has two kinds of statements (`Statement` and `PreparedStatement`), Druid has just one that attempts to do what the two JDBC statements do. That is, it tries to be both prepared and non-prepared.\r\n\r\nAlso, while JDBC separates the idea of statement and `ResultSet`, Druid combines the two: closing the result set closes the statement as well. While this might be handy, for a `Statement`, it does work at cross-purposes to the `PreparedStatement` which is designed to be prepared once and executed multiple times. Closing the statement after the first execution forces `PreparedStatement` to be identical to `Statement` (except that the former takes parameters.)\r\n\r\n### Corrects the Druid JDBC Driver Behavior\r\n\r\nWe could argue about the merits of the Druid design. However, JDBC is a standard and the correct behavior is spelled out in the [JDBC 4.1 Spec](https://download.oracle.com/otn-pub/jcp/jdbc-4_1-mrel-spec/jdbc4.1-fr-spec.pdf?AuthParam=1655858260_d6388aeec9aeb8e5616d221749b1ff71). That behavior is:\r\n\r\n* A `Statement` is a reusable object that can execute multiple SQL statements, using a `ResultSet`. Closing the `ResultSet` does not close the statement. Druid can, however, close the `ResultSet` on EOF.\r\n* A `PreparedStatement` is a reusable object created with a (typically parameterized) SQL statement. Each execution is given a set of parameter values, and produces a `ResultSet`. Again, closing the `ResultSet` does not close the statement, which allows the statement to be executed with a different set of parameters.\r\n\r\nTo correct the Druid behavior, the Avatica JDBC implementation is refactored to clearly model the JDBC concepts:\r\n\r\n* `DruidJdbcStatement` models a (non-prepared) Statement.\r\n* `DruidJdbcPreparedStatement` models a PreparedStatement.\r\n* `AbstractDruidJdbcStatement` is the common base class for the above.\r\n* `DruidJdbcResultSet` represents a result set (a running query).\r\n\r\nWhile PR #12636 went on to modify the planner and the `SqlLifecyle` layers, this PR leaves those layers unchanged, and implements the desired behavior with the existing code. The hope is that the result is a bit easier on reviewers. This code will be modified again later to support the single-pass planner.\r\n\r\nThe Avatica driver tests were modified to be consistent with the JDBC standard. The original code didn't pass, but the revised code does.\r\n\r\nThe result is that we now have a clean SQL stack for JDBC, HTTP and internal use that make a single planner pass when possible, and use two passes for the JDBC prepare/execute model.\r\n\r\n### Flaky Test: `DruidAvaticaHandlerTest.testConcurrentQueries()`\r\n\r\nAlso fixes a flaky test: `DruidAvaticaHandlerTest.testConcurrentQueries()`. This test has occasionally failed in builds. The problem was first mentioned in 2017 in [Issue #4408](https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/4408) , which was claimed to be fixed. When run in a tight loop, however, the test eventually fails with an NPE. The issue is traced to the context on the `DruidConnection`: it is passed to each statement, where it is shared and concurrently modified. The fix is to make a copy for each new statement which avoids queries trying to share the same map.\r\n\r\nVerified the problem by running the test 100 times in a tight loop. Verified the fix the same way.\r\n\r\n### Minor Revisions\r\n\r\nCareful inspection of the code identified several other improvements:\r\n\r\n* Hold the yielder thread pool on the connection, not statement, so we get some benefit from caching.

is a breakout from PR #12636: Single Pass through the Calcite planner. This PR adds just one item: a clone of the Calcite planner, lightly converted to Druid's coding style, with a method to provide access to the validator. The only tricky bit is the validator itself. While #12636 cloned the validator, this PR uses a sneaky approach: it defines `DruidSqlValidator` as a subclass of the unreachable `CalciteSqlValidator`. To do that, it lives in the same Calcite name space as `CalciteSqlValidator`. Some checkstyle hacking was needed to allow this odd state of affairs.\r\n\r\nThere is zero change in functionality: everything works exactly as before. The goal here is simply to review the replacement of the Druid home-grown validator with the Calcite-provided one.

the Docker image build for the revised ITs. Split out from PR #12368 to simplify review and merge.\r\n\r\nThis PR contains two items:\r\n\r\n`it-tools` which defines the IT test extensions that are added into the IT Docker image. These are the same as what the `integration-tests` project provides, just built separately and packaged so they can be added to the image. `it-tools` is built as part of the Maven build, after `distribution`. Its output is an extension jar. No harm in including it even in non-IT builds.\r\n\r\n`it-image` which builds the Docker image. It is activated by the `test-image` profile.\r\n\r\nIn addition, `.travis.yml` is modified to run the Docker image to show that it builds. Nothing uses the image, that will come when #12368 is merged. We're just proving that that the build works to assure reviewers that things are correct.\r\n\r\nThe changes here have already been reviewed as part of #12368. This is a subset of those changes.

servers talk to each other over HTTP. We have a low-level HTTP\r\nclient (HttpClient) that is super-asynchronous and super-customizable\r\nthrough its handlers. It's also proven to be quite robust: we use it\r\nfor Broker -> Historical communication over the wide variety of query\r\ntypes and workloads we support.\r\n\r\nBut the low-level client has no facilities for service location or\r\nretries, which means we have a variety of high-level clients that\r\nimplement these in their own ways. Some high-level clients do a better\r\njob than others. This patch adds a mid-level ServiceClient that makes\r\nit easier for high-level clients to be built correctly and harmoniously,\r\nand migrates some of the high-level logic to use ServiceClients.\r\n\r\nMain changes:\r\n\r\n1) Add ServiceClient org.apache.druid.rpc package. That package also\r\n   contains supporting stuff like ServiceLocator and RetryPolicy\r\n   interfaces, and a DiscoveryServiceLocator based on\r\n   DruidNodeDiscoveryProvider.\r\n\r\n2) Add high-level OverlordClient in org.apache.druid.rpc.indexing.\r\n\r\n3) Indexing task client creator in TaskServiceClients. It uses\r\n   SpecificTaskServiceLocator to find the tasks. This improves on\r\n   ClientInfoTaskProvider by caching task locations for up to 30 seconds\r\n   across calls, reducing load on the Overlord.\r\n\r\n4) Rework ParallelIndexSupervisorTaskClient to use a ServiceClient\r\n   instead of extending IndexTaskClient.\r\n\r\n5) Rework RemoteTaskActionClient to use a ServiceClient instead of\r\n   DruidLeaderClient.\r\n\r\n6) Rework LocalIntermediaryDataManager, TaskMonitor, and\r\n   ParallelIndexSupervisorTask. As a result, MiddleManager, Peon, and\r\n   Overlord no longer need IndexingServiceClient (which internally used\r\n   DruidLeaderClient).\r\n\r\nThere are some concrete benefits over the prior logic, namely:\r\n\r\n- DruidLeaderClient does retries in its \"go\" method, but only retries\r\n  exactly 5 times, does not sleep between retries, and does not retry\r\n  retryable HTTP codes like 502, 503, 504. (It only retries IOExceptions.)\r\n  ServiceClient handles retries in a more reasonable way.\r\n\r\n- DruidLeaderClient's methods are all synchronous, whereas ServiceClient\r\n  methods are asynchronous. This is used in one place so far: the\r\n  SpecificTaskServiceLocator, so we don't need to block a thread trying\r\n  to locate a task. It can be used in other places in the future.\r\n\r\n- HttpIndexingServiceClient does not properly handle all server errors.\r\n  In some cases, it tries to parse a server error as a successful\r\n  response (for example: in getTaskStatus).\r\n\r\n- IndexTaskClient currently makes an Overlord call on every task-to-task\r\n  HTTP request, as a way to find where the target task is. ServiceClient,\r\n  through SpecificTaskServiceLocator, caches these target locations\r\n  for a period of time.","created_at":"2022-06-23T05:23:23Z","updated_at":"2022-08-26T08:10:18Z","closed_at":"2022-07-05T16:43:26Z","merged_at":"2022-07-05T16:43:26Z","merge_commit_sha":"2b330186e2a35ead88f3e1a5bfcd4de8853d081a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":222509152,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMjI1MDkxNTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Operations","name":"Area - Operations","color":"fef2c0","default":false,"description":null},{"id":2717749995,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE3NzQ5OTk1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Ingestion","name":"Area - Ingestion","color":"fef2c0","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/46","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/milestone/46","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/46/labels","id":8348738,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAGEErM4Af2RC","number":46,"title":"24.0.0","description":"Druid 24.0.0 release.

PR #12187 the default was changed to `druid.coordinator.kill.on = true`. However, I think this is too risky of a default without the logic in #12526. Currently the main safeguard against accidental permanent deletion is `durationToRetain`, which is based on the segment interval, not the time the segment was marked unused. This means older segments can be eligible for autokilling immediately after being marked unused. This can happen by mistake: someone might activate the \"mark unused\" functionality (via API or web console) for the wrong datasource, or the wrong interval. Then autokilling can turn that small mistake into a big mistake.\r\n\r\nSo, I think we should change the default back to `false` and revisit once the logic in #12526 is implemented. This patch does that, as well as updates the docs to be more clear about how the behavior works, so people can understand it prior to turning autokilling on.","created_at":"2022-06-22T19:45:42Z","updated_at":"2022-08-26T08:10:43Z","closed_at":"2022-06-24T00:17:11Z","merged_at":"2022-06-24T00:17:11Z","merge_commit_sha":"d29343cbe36357356ec65a2f56087d5b39e92148","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/46","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/milestone/46","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/46/labels","id":8348738,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAGEErM4Af2RC","number":46,"title":"24.0.0","description":"Druid 24.0.0 release.

reverts commit 8fbf92e047f792ff1c69bf67d14784ac55eee88f (PR #12600).\r\n\r\nWhile that patch fixed a correctness bug, it also introduced a performance regression: the number of segments returned from the metadata store to Druid servers increases substantially. We observed significant slowdowns on Overlord APIs as a result of this.\r\n\r\nThe main problem is that 4-digit, 5-digit, 6-digit, etc, years are all jumbled up when sorted lexicographically. We can't write a range filter (such that metadata store indexes can be used) without also potentially returning a bunch of extra records that need to be filtered out on the Overlord.\r\n\r\nI can't see a good way to solve the original correctness bug while maintaining performance, other than introducing bigint-typed versions of `start` and `end`. So I think we'll need to do that, unless someone else has a better idea.","created_at":"2022-06-20T17:12:36Z","updated_at":"2022-09-23T19:27:10Z","closed_at":"2022-06-25T03:38:26Z","merged_at":"2022-06-25T03:38:26Z","merge_commit_sha":"679ccffe0fe11cd4ecc5998138c7436bb0b5955a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/46","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/milestone/46","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/46/labels","id":8348738,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAGEErM4Af2RC","number":46,"title":"24.0.0","description":"Druid 24.0.0 release.

[new IT PR](https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/12368/files#) has struggled to get a clean build due to the complexity and flakiness of the Druid build system. It is ironic that the attempt to fix the ITs has been stymied by the fragility of the existing ITs. Out of desperation, the big PR is being broken up into smaller chunks. This one provides changes made to the existing ITs to support the new ITs.\r\n\r\nThe first set of changes make the \"custom node role\" code usable by the new ITs. No functional change, just some clean-up. There are also some documentation updates.\r\n\r\nThe second change is more substantial. The new ITs use the \"failsafe\" Maven plugin, which is the sister plugin to the \"failsafe\" plugin Druid uses for unit tests (UTs). The venerable `-DskipTests` flag will thus skip both ITs and UTs. But, when running the new ITs, we want to skip the UTs, but run the ITs. A [common solution](https://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-failsafe-plugin/examples/skipping-tests.html) is to [use separate flags for ITs and UTs](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6612344/prevent-unit-tests-but-allow-integration-tests-in-maven).\r\n\r\n* `-DskipITs` skips the integration tests but runs unit tests.\r\n* `-DskipUTs` skips unit tests but runs the \"new\" integration tests.\r\n\r\nThe existing Druid profile, `-P skip-tests` is expanded to skip both ITs and UTs.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, `-DskipTests` and `-DskipUTs` have the same effect. However, once the new ITs are in place, the meanings will differ, as explained above.\r\n\r\nThe key purpose of this PR is to test the new setup in Travis separately from the other changes in PR #12368.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [X] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [X] has been tested in the Travis Druid build (the purpose of this PR.)","created_at":"2022-06-17T18:12:22Z","updated_at":"2022-08-26T08:10:34Z","closed_at":"2022-06-25T20:43:59Z","merged_at":"2022-06-25T20:43:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"f83fab699ee3756d3a749961efa2dca41fad7841","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/46","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/milestone/46","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/46/labels","id":8348738,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAGEErM4Af2RC","number":46,"title":"24.0.0","description":"Druid 24.0.0 release.

[new IT PR](https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/12368/files#) has struggled to get a clean build due to the complexity and flakiness of the Druid build system. It is ironic that the attempt to fix the ITs has been stymied by the fragility of the existing ITs. Out of desperation, the big PR is being broken up into smaller chunks. This one provides the myriad cleanup tasks done in that PR.\r\n\r\nThe cleanup is of two kinds:\r\n\r\n* Just general cleanup: fixing misspellings, etc.\r\n* Allowing the use of some of Druid's \"JSON config\" objects in tests.\r\n\r\nThe general cleanup is self-explanatory. The JSON configs are odd beasts: there is no way to create one via code; only using the JSON config mechanism that populates the instance dynamically from a provided set of properties. While that is great in production, it does make it very hard to create the config in tests. Since we do, in fact, want to test, this PR alters a few of these configs to provide a constructor or factory method.\r\n\r\nFurther, the config key used for properties tends to reside in the consumer of those properties. If we do want to create one in tests, using the property mechanism, we have to copy/paste that key. To make life a bit easier here, this PR moves the key to a constant inside the config object itself (but only for those configs used by the IT PR.)\r\n\r\nThe ITs want to create a Guice instance for \"client\" use, not for use in a Druid server. The existing ITs jump though some amazing hoops to do this. The new ones take a somewhat different path. To make this possible, a few of the formerly-private bits related to Guice initialization are now exposed for use by tests.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [X] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [X] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [X] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2022-06-17T17:23:10Z","updated_at":"2022-08-26T08:10:45Z","closed_at":"2022-06-23T17:49:51Z","merged_at":"2022-06-23T17:49:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"ffcb996468c343450258f90bd88a6b55aae4ef59","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":303259531,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMDMyNTk1MzE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Testing","name":"Area - Testing","color":"fef2c0","default":false,"description":null},{"id":782100314,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3ODIxMDAzMTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Refactoring","name":"Refactoring","color":"d1ea7e","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/46","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/milestone/46","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/46/labels","id":8348738,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAGEErM4Af2RC","number":46,"title":"24.0.0","description":"Druid 24.0.0 release.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

Changed it in a way that we are using a local URI.\r\n\r\nThe uber goal was to fix https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/10853 but that is tricky as it would require a new Nginx docker image to be bundled to serve static contents.\r\nWill defer it until https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/12368 makes it into master.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n\r\nFixes the unit test `HttpEntity` which was contacting `https://druid.apache.org/data/wikipedia.json.gz`. Changed it in a way that a local server gets started in the unit test and shuts down when the UT is finished. \r\n\r\nThe uber goal was to fix https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/10853 but that is tricky as it would require a new Nginx docker image to be bundled to serve static contents.\r\nWill defer it until https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/12368 makes it into master.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing. If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code?

What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `HttpEntityTest`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

stuff to its own package and separates CurrentTimestampAndFriendsConvertlet from DruidConvertletTable. With more than one convertlet, this keeps things more tidy.\r\n\r\nNote: the operator does not work for the \"OVERWRITE WHERE\" clause of REPLACE queries. That clause has sort of a hand-coded equivalent of SqlToRelConverter and so it would need to have a special case added for this operator. That should be done in a followup.

I think it's time for them to start delegating to their followers.\r\n\r\nThere are some `GET` requests that can be delegated safely, in my opinion. Example:\r\n* GET /druid-ext/basic-security/authentication/db/*\r\n* GET /druid-ext/basic-security/authorization/db/*\r\n* GET /druid/indexer/v1/task/*/log\r\n* GET /druid/indexer/v1/task/*/reports\r\n* GET /druid/indexer/v1/task/*/segments\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\n`CoordinatorPollingBasicAuthenticatorCacheManager` and its `Authorizer` counterpart are running inside every daemon, fetching `/druid-ext/basic-security/authentication/db/%s/cachedSerializedUserMap` data and cache them on local disk.\r\n\r\nWhen Coordinator is under heavy load, this remote call can break and fail the daemon. Specifically with Peon, since it goes up and down on every subtask ingestion, this failure can results in a failed ingestion. And that's unfortunate considering that Middle Manager already saved perfectly good Authz cache data on local disk.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\nThis patch makes absolutely sure that any kind of failure will force the daemon to load the local cache on disk.\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #5772.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR. Remove this section if there is no corresponding issue. Don't reference the issue in the title of this pull-request. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are a committer, follow the PR action item checklist for committers:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/committer-instructions.md#pr-and-issue-action-item-checklist-for-committers. -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing. If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\nIn a heterogeneous environment, sometimes you don't have control over the input folder. Upstream can put any folder they want. In this situation the `S3InputSource.java` is unusable.\r\n\r\nMost people like me solved it by using Airflow to fetch the full list of parquet files and pass it over to Druid. But doing this explodes the JSON spec. We had a situation where 1 of the JSON spec is 16MB and that's simply too much for Overlord.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\nThis patch allows users to pass `{\"filter\": \"*.parquet\"}` and let Druid performs the filtering of the input files.\r\n\r\nI am using the `glob` notation to be consistent with the [LocalFirehose syntax](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/ingestion/native-batch.html#localfirehose).\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `S3InputSource`\r\n * `CloudObjectInputSource`\r\n * `OssInputSource`\r\n * `AzureInputSource`\r\n * `GoogleCloudStorageInputSource`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

This PR provides the foundation: the DB and REST layer, but not yet the integration with the Calcite SQL layer.\r\n\r\nThe DB layer extends what is done for other Druid metadata tables.  The semantic (\"business logic\") layer provides the usual CRUD operations on tables, as well as operations to sync metadata between the Coordinator and Broker. A synchronization layer handles the Coordinator/Broker sync: the Broker polls for the information it does not yet have: the Coordinator pushes updates to known Brokers. \r\n\r\nThe entire design is pretty standard and follows Druid patterns. The key difference is the rather extreme lengths taken by the implementation to ensure each bit is easily testable without mocks. That means many interfaces which can be implemented in multiple ways.\r\n\r\nWhile the entire catalog mechanism is present in this PR, the Guice configuration is not yet enabled, meaning that the catalog is not yet enabled. This project has created, or depends on, multiple in-flight PRs and it is becoming a bit complex to combine them all in a private branch. This is one of several PRs that provide slices of catalog work.\r\n\r\nWe'll want to create integration tests when we enable the feature, and that work is waiting for the [new IT PR](https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/12368) to be merged.\r\n\r\nThe next step in the catalog work is to integrate the catalog with the Druid planner. For that, we'll need the [planner test framework](https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/12545) to be merged.\r\n\r\nThis code will likely evolve as we work on the SQL layer. Some of that work has already been done in a private branch and suggests that the present code is pretty much on the right track: we'll just expand the table and column definitions as needed.\r\n\r\nThis is a great opportunity for reviewers to provide guidance on the basic catalog mechanism before we start building SQL integration on top.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [X] has a design document [here](https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/12546).\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors. (Not yet: the functionality is not yet user visible.)\r\n- [X] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [X] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [X] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.

#11933 proposed using the industry-standard operator DAG structure for Druid queries in place of the existing Sequence-based approach. The issue has a lengthy discussion of the reasons.\r\n\r\nSeparately, issue #12262 proposes a multi-stage query engine for Druid, focused on long-running report-style queries and ingestion. To extend that idea to the low-latency space would seem to demand we start with what we already have, and which has proven itself to be rock-solid in many production shops.\r\n\r\nPutting the two together, to create a multi-stage solution for Druid's low-latency query path, we propose to evolve what we have, step-by-step, to the industry-standard operator DAG approach, which will allow us to introduce multi-stage queries within the existing framework.\r\n\r\nThis PR is a first step: it provides the foundation structure. The code here has already been used to create a full operator-based solution for [scan queries in the context of the historical node](https://github.com/paul-rogers/druid/tree/op-step1) and to fully convert the scan query path for the [test query stack](https://github.com/paul-rogers/druid/tree/op-step2). That work will be contributed, step-by-step, building on top of this PR.\r\n\r\nSee [the README](https://github.com/paul-rogers/druid/blob/20942c83c23d7bae516bace80fdf07b3603067a5/processing/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/queryng/README.md) for more details.\r\n\r\n### Operators\r\n\r\nAn operator does one task in a data pipeline. The key operator abstractions include:\r\n\r\n* `Operator`: an interface for a data pipeline component. An operator can be opened to provide an iterator over results, then closed. An operator can have zero inputs (a leaf operator), one input (a filter, limit or projection operator) or multiple inputs (join, merge, union, etc.)\r\n* `RowIterator`: a super-simple iterator over the rows which an operator produces. Uses an exception to signal EOF, which reduces the code needed in a data pipeline relative to the Java iterator protocol.\r\n\r\nMultiple variations of operators are provided in this PR. All of these operators are simple in the sense that they only refer to other operators, but not to any of Druid's query infrastructure.\r\n\r\n* `LimitOperator`: applies a limit to a result set.\r\n* `NullOperator`: does nothing, like an empty list or empty iterator.\r\n* `MappingOperator`: takes one input and applies some form of mapping as defined by a derived class.\r\n* `ConcatOpreator`: performs a union of its inputs, emitting each one after the other.\r\n* `OrderedMergeOperator` implements an ordered merge of multiple inputs.\r\n* `WrappingOperator` similar to \"baggage\" on sequences: an operator that does tasks at the start and end, of result set, but imposes no per-row overhead.\r\n\r\n### Fragments\r\n\r\nOperators combine to form a data pipeline. Data pipelines are distributed, as in Druid's scatter/gather architecture. A common terminology is to say that the entire query forms a DAG. The DAG is \"sliced\" at node boundaries, with exchanges between slices. At runtime, a *slice* is replicated across many nodes. Each instance of a slice is a *fragment*.\r\n\r\nThis PR provides the basics of the fragment structure. In most engines, a planner converts SQL into a logical plan, then into a physical plan that describes the operator DAG. Slices of that plan are sent to nodes which then execute the fragments. Druid, however, already has an existing `QueryRunner` based structure. `QueryRunner` are actually \"query planners\": the `QueryRunner.run()` method is better thought of as `QueryPlanner.plan()`: it figures out what sequence is needed at that point in the pipeline and creates that sequence.\r\n\r\nOur first step in the path to adopt operators is to reuse the query runners. Instead of creating sequences, we modify `QueryRunner`s to create operators. The fragment-related abstractions in this PR support such an approach.\r\n\r\n* `FragmentContext`: the state shared by all operators in a fragment. For now, this state includes the `ResponseContext` and, internally, the collection of all operators that form the fragment.\r\n* `FragmentBuilder`: creates a fragment from a collection of operators, and provides an API to run the resulting fragment.\r\n* `FragmentRun`: runs the fragment, which means calling `open()` on the root operator, returning the root operator's iterator, and closing all operators at the completion of the run.\r\n* `FragmentBuilderFactory`: a factory to create a fragment builder. This class will be injected via Guice.\r\n\r\nWe will need a way to pass the `FragmentContext` to `QueryRunner`s so that they can create operators for a fragment. It turns out that `QueryPlus` is handy way to accomplish this, so this PR contains the required `QueryPlus` code. That code isn't used yet: we're just setting things up.\r\n\r\n### Starter Scan Query Operators\r\n\r\nThis PR has been marked as needing design review. To help with the review, this PR includes a “starter set” of scan query operators that illustrates how the mechanism works.\r\n\r\n#### Bootstrap\r\n\r\nThe `QueryNGModule` defines a `FragmentBuilderFactory` which is injected into `QueryLifecycleFactory`. That factory then creates a `QueryLifecycle`. The query lifecycle checks if the query is enabled (as described above) using the config attached to ``FragmentBuilderFactory`. If so, it then uses ``FragmentBuilderFactory`` to create a `FragmentBuilder` which is then attached to the `QueryPlus` for that query. \r\n\r\nFrom then on, each `QueryRunner` checks if there is a `FragmentBuilder` instance attached to the `QueryPlus`. If so, the query runner creates an operator (if that query runner has been converted to do so), else it executes the \"classic\" code path to create a sequence.\r\n\r\nNote that, if the mechanism is not enabled, there will never be a `FragmentBuilder` attached to the `QueryPlus`, and so execution will ignore the operator path.\r\n\r\n#### Operator and Sequence Interoperability\r\n\r\nIn this PR, a set of shims allows operators to read from sequences, and to masquerade as sequences. This allows operators to seamlessly insert themselves into a sequence-based execution pipeline.\r\n\r\nWhen two operators are adjacent, the intervening sequence is optimized away, leaving the the two operators to talk directly.\r\n\r\nAs the conversion continues, there will be more operators and fewer in the execution pipeline.\r\n\r\n#### Operator \"Planning\"\r\n\r\nThe `QueryRunner.run()` method can actually be seen as being a `QueryPlanner.plan()` method: the method decides which sequences are needed to run a query. The sequences do the actually running. In this light, it is easy to see how we convert to operators: the `QueryRunner.run()` method creates an operator instead.\r\n\r\nLooking ahead, the \"planning\" code can be gathered up in a \"native query planner\". In anticipation, each converted `QueryRunner` calls to `ScanQueryPlanner` to decide which operator(s) to create. In some cases, the operator is a 1:1 replacement for a sequence. In other cases, it turns out we can optimize the query by omitting unneeded operators, or by using one of several finely tuned operators in place of the generalized sequence in the existing code.\r\n\r\nThe general pattern is:\r\n\r\n* Accept a `QueryPlus` and an upstream `QueryRunner`.\r\n* Create an operator which runs the `QueryRunner`.\r\n* Convert the resulting sequence to an \"input operator.\"\r\n* Decide which operator(s) we need to add to perform the task at hand.\r\n* Wrap the result in a sequence compatible with the return value of `QueryRunner.run()`.\r\n\r\nAgain, the code is such that the \"shim\" sequences and operators melt away when operators are adjacent.\r\n\r\n#### Scan Operators\r\n\r\nThis PR includes the following scan query operators:\r\n\r\n* `CursorReader` reads from one or more `Cursor`s.\r\n* `ScanQueryOperator` replaces the `ScanQueryEngine`, which pretty much reads from a set of cursors.\r\n* `GroupedScanResultLimitOperator`, `UngroupedScanResultLimitOperator`: limit operators for scans.\r\n* `ScanResultOffsetOperator`: offset operator for scans.\r\n* `ScanListToArrayOperator`, `ScanCompactListToArrayOperator`: unpacks scan \"batches\" to individual rows.\r\n\r\nSurprisingly, these are the only scan-specific operators required. A later PR will include the set of generic operators needed to completely replace sequences in the scan query path, at least for tests.\r\n\r\n### Configuration\r\n\r\nAt present, the operator path is experimental, and thus disabled by default. The operator path is enabled in this PR only for test queries, and only using the flag described below. The mechanism is completely disabled for production code. We'll enable it later after we convert more operators.\r\n\r\nFor test queries, the mechanism is enabled (only for tests) by setting a system property: `-druid.queryng.enabled=true`. This is a temporary approach, good enough for testing. Tests use the \"classic\" mechanism unless this flag is set for the test. Even with enabled with the flag, the mechanism is enabled only for scan queries; disabled for all other query types. Later PRs will widen the path.\r\n\r\nA later PR will provide a config variable to enable the operator path in production code. At that time, if the `druid.queryng.enable` config property is set to `true`, then the mechanism is optional. By default, the mechanism also requires that the `queryng` variable be set to `true` in the query context. A second config variable, `druid.queryng.requireContext` can be set to `false` to enable use of the mechanism without setting a per-query context variable, which is handy for running tests.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\nOne of the very handy things about operators is that they are highly modular and thus extremely easy to unit test. Tests exist for all the basic abstractions defined above. Further, all SQL `CalciteQueryTest` queries were run with the mechanism enabled.\r\n\r\n### Next Steps\r\n\r\nThe goal of this PR is for reviewers to focus on the core abstractions. The next PR will begin to create the parallel operator path for scan queries. Those PRs will provide operators converted from the existing sequences, along with the \"planner\" code that query runners use to define the operator. That whole path an be seen in [this branch](https://github.com/paul-rogers/druid/tree/op-step2).\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [X] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

has traditionally supported just one kind of SQL statement: `SELECT`. The planner was thus designed to process \"a query\", and an ever-increasing amount of conditional code was added to support other statements such as `INSERT` and `REPLACE`. As we look toward adding DDL statements, the current approach will become unworkable. Other SQL products introduce an additional layer to handle statement types: the *statement handler*. This PR adds statement handlers to Druid.\r\n\r\nThis PR builds on the [single-pass planner](https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/12636) PR to heavily refactor the Druid planner to split statement-specific code into a set of statement-specific handler classes. All handlers implement a simple interface:\r\n\r\n```java\r\ninterface SqlStatementHandler\r\n{\r\n  void analyze() throws ValidationException;\r\n  Set<ResourceAction> resourceActions();\r\n  PrepareResult prepare() throws RelConversionException, ValidationException;\r\n  PlannerResult plan() throws SqlParseException, ValidationException, RelConversionException;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe details of what is needed for each statement is a (complex) implementation detail of the handler classes.\r\n\r\nAt present, all the SQL statements which Druid supports include a `SELECT`: `EXPLAIN`, `INSERT`, `REPLACE` and, of course, `SELECT` itself. To reflect this fact, a base `QueryHandler` class handles the common aspects. As we add other statements (such as DDL), completely new handlers will handle those cases.\r\n\r\nFor the most part, the code is identical between `master` and this PR, but the code is heavily refactored and shifted around.\r\n\r\nThe key risk with this kind of change is that we break something. To catch any regression, this work was done in a private branch that also had the [planner test framework](https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/12545). The planner artifacts (schema, logical plan, native query) were identical before and after the change. The various `Calcite?QueryTest` cases provide a lighter validation in this PR itself, since the planner framework is not yet in master, nor is it included in this PR.\r\n\r\nSince the PR incorporates #12636, we should review and merge that PR first. I'll then rebase this one on the updated master which will remove the common code, leaving only the handler-related changes.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [X] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Druid planner contains the following comment:\r\n\r\n```text\r\n   * In some future this could perhaps re-use some of the work done by {@link #validate(boolean)}\r\n   * instead of repeating it, but that day is not today.\r\n```\r\n\r\nWell, today *is* that day. The Druid planner now makes only one pass through Calcite planner. This means we parse and validate the query only once, not twice as before.\r\n\r\nThe original two-pass approach likely was a way to resolve a conflict. Druid wants access to the \"validator\" used to validate a query so we can extract the \"resource actions\" (the datasources which the query accesses.) The validator is private to the default `CalcitePlanner`, so Druid created its own. However, to then continue on to planning, the Calcite planner throws a fit because it thinks we skipped the validation step, because we didn't do validation though Calcites's own default planner. Hence, we had to start over and do it Calcite's way.\r\n\r\nNow, as it turns out, there is nothing special about the default `CalcitePlannerImpl`: it seems to exist as a handy way to support out-of-the-box, JDBC-based queries. More advanced use cases generally provide their own implementation. So, this PR clones the Calcite class, but with adjustments for Druid. The main adjustment is to provide access to the validator.\r\n\r\nOnce we resolve the validation issue, the rest is just plumbing: saving the parser state between validate on the one hand, and prepare/plan on the other. `SqlLifecycle` and `DruidPlanner` change a bit to handle that task.\r\n\r\nThe PR also moves some validation-like code from the `plan()` method to `validate()` to better fit into the new flow.\r\n\r\nThe key risk with this kind of change is that we break something. To catch any regression, this work was done in a private branch that also had the [planner test framework](https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/12545). The planner artifacts (schema, logical plan, native query) were identical before and after the change. The various `Calcite?QueryTest` cases provide a lighter validation in this PR itself, since the planner framework is not yet in master, nor is it included in this PR.\r\n\r\nThe result of this change is that:\r\n\r\n* The Druid planner produces less \"garbage\" due to Calcite's heavy object creation.\r\n* We do half the work within Calcite, thus saving some CPU resource.\r\n* Table (datasource) checks are done once, avoiding potential race conditions if they change between validation and plan.\r\n\r\n### Authorization\r\n\r\nReview comments called attention to some oddities in authorization that are addressed in a revised commit:\r\n\r\n* Authorization is moved from `SqlLifecycle` to `DruidPlanner` so it can be enforced as part of the query lifecycle. A new `authorize()` call does the job and ensures that the call is a) made, and b) made at the correct time.\r\n* Because of this, `ValidationResult` became redundant and was removed: the resource actions are mostly now private to the planner itself.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [X] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

is a subset of the changes for the [planner test framework](https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/12545), split out to make reviews easier.\r\n\r\nDruid native queries are often serialized to JSON. In the planner framework, we save the JSON as an \"expected plan.\" To make the resulting files a bit smaller, this PR removes from the JSON those fields with default values: values that Jackson would infer even if the fields are not present. For example, rather than spelling out `\"foo\": null`, we can simply omit `\"foo\"` and get the same results. The same is true for `\"foo\": {}` and `\"foo\": []` since most constructors will create an empty collection if passed a null.\r\n\r\nThe clean-up is done using the `@JsonInclude` annotation, sometimes with a custom filter class. Scan Query has a batch size which defaults to `4096 * 5` if the provided value is 0. Given this, added a filter which omits the value if it is the default, which avoids cluttering the deserialized JSON with magic numbers.\r\n\r\nSome unit tests check for an exact serialization of the JSON, including the now-removed `null` fields. All such tests were updated with the revised format.\r\n\r\nThis change is purely cosmetic: the deserialized query objects do not change meaning. Tested via unit tests, including the new planner test framework.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [X] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2022-06-10T21:41:34Z","updated_at":"2022-08-26T08:11:00Z","closed_at":"2022-06-16T21:07:25Z","merged_at":"2022-06-16T21:07:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"893759de91133efee56a2ac919532afa4cb61bd3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/46","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/milestone/46","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/46/labels","id":8348738,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAGEErM4Af2RC","number":46,"title":"24.0.0","description":"Druid 24.0.0 release.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #12630.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #12628 .\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

Description\r\nThis PR splits out `NULL` value index into their own construct for filter processing for two reasons. The first is that the new index structure, introduced in #12388 means that we can now provide basically any index we can imagine, and I imagined by having a separate `NullValueIndex` for `ColumnIndexSupplier` to provide to `Filter`, we can provide limited indexes for existing Druid numeric columns (if `druid.generic.useDefaultValueForFalse=false`). This improves performance quite nicely when using numeric columns in `IS NULL`/`IS NOT NULL` style queries.\r\n\r\n```\r\n      // 42,43: filter numeric nulls\r\n      \"SELECT SUM(long5) FROM foo WHERE long5 IS NOT NULL\",\r\n      \"SELECT string2, SUM(long5) FROM foo WHERE long5 IS NOT NULL GROUP BY 1\"\r\n```\r\nbefore:\r\n```\r\nBenchmark                        (query)  (rowsPerSegment)  (vectorize)  Mode  Cnt    Score    Error  Units\r\nSqlExpressionBenchmark.querySql       42           5000000        false  avgt    5  107.308 ±  3.975  ms/op\r\nSqlExpressionBenchmark.querySql       42           5000000        force  avgt    5  118.790 ±  1.792  ms/op\r\nSqlExpressionBenchmark.querySql       43           5000000        false  avgt    5  259.829 ± 12.465  ms/op\r\nSqlExpressionBenchmark.querySql       43           5000000        force  avgt    5  241.353 ± 10.005  ms/op\r\n```\r\nafter:\r\n```\r\nBenchmark                        (query)  (rowsPerSegment)  (vectorize)  Mode  Cnt    Score   Error  Units\r\nSqlExpressionBenchmark.querySql       42           5000000        false  avgt    5   71.755 ± 3.011  ms/op\r\nSqlExpressionBenchmark.querySql       42           5000000        force  avgt    5   55.674 ± 1.288  ms/op\r\nSqlExpressionBenchmark.querySql       43           5000000        false  avgt    5  241.125 ± 5.544  ms/op\r\nSqlExpressionBenchmark.querySql       43           5000000        force  avgt    5  176.183 ± 7.409  ms/op\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe second reason to split null value indexes into their own thing, is to set the stage towards allowing our filter behavior to be SQL compliant. With this explicit null value index in place, if we modify the other index providers to never match null, we should make it a lot harder for filters to accidentally match nulls using indexes, and could allow for the cursor builder to use of implicit 'is not null' indexes for columns which are not explicitly being matched for 'is null'.
