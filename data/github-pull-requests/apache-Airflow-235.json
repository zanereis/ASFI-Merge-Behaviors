Removes the ldap3 library which was used in the old auth_ldap module (removed in https://github.com/apache/airflow/commit/3a7b741ab9ed0937571c77a10b5d244f14eaf7db)\r\n2.

[3](https://github.com/dpgaspar/Flask-AppBuilder/issues/806#issuecomment-421334361))\r\n\r\nDon't think we need to add tests here since it's more of a FAB thing than an Airflow

the color for each state is repeatedly appearing in the response payload of endpoints `/dag_stats` and `/task_stats`.\r\n\r\nThis can be avoided by having the mapping between state and color in the static file, and map each state into different color at client side after client receives the necessary info, instead of passing duplicated color information in the response payload.\r\n\r\nThis significantly reduces the size of data to be transferred from server to client.\r\n\r\n---\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before creating PR: [x]\r\n\r\n- [x] Description above provides context

should be set to false everywhere except UI,\r\nexperimental API and dag import\r\n\r\nAdded missing store_serialized_dags to the _DagBag class.\r\n\r\nWhen I have applied store_serialized_dags from config everywhere I did\r\nnot know/understand how this parameter works.\r\n\r\nIt caused some problems:\r\n* migrations failed as they have used DagBag with SerializedDag before serialized_dags table was created\r\n* code that runs after all migrations and clean up dags took much longer as it was creating and saving serialized representations of dags\r\n* and, first of all, scheduler stopped parsing dags because\r\nDagBag::collect_dags method that it uses, returned no dags, as it does\r\nnot collect dags when stored_serialized_dags is on.\r\nGenerally, even though store_serialized_dags parameter is used in\r\nmodels and throughout common code, it should only be set to True in web\r\nserver.\r\nIf it is set to true in other parts of the system, they will stop\r\nworking.\r\nCLI will stop working.\r\nScheduler is the element that creates serialized dags and it should\r\nalways read from disk to keep other parts of the system up to date.\r\nBut there is no way to check whether dag_bag was called by web server and\r\nstore_serialized_dags should be applied or if it was called from\r\nscheduler and dags should be read from files on the disk not from the db.\r\n\r\n---\r\nMake

dag_processing.py imports the `multiprocessing` library, and uses `multiprocessing.connection.Connection` to declare a `Connection` type for the `DagFileProcessorManager` class. This causes an import error on OS X. \r\n\r\nThis happens because the `multiprocessing` package does not expose the `.connection`module by default. To access this behavior, you need to call [`multiprocessing.allow_connection_pickling()`](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/17a5588740b3d126d546ad1a13bdac4e028e6d50/Lib/multiprocessing/context.py#L164)  first. \r\n\r\nAlternatively, instead of importing `multiprocessing` calling `multiprocessing.connection.Connection` in your code, you can import the Connection class directly:\r\n```\r\nfrom multiprocessing.connection import Connection\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR makes that update.Presumably, this distinction matters bc of weird rules in Python's import code.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before creating

purpose of this pr is to get more flexibility with the ExternalTaskSensor to be able to pass the context in the execution_date_fn for the purpose of doing some logic that cannot just be handled with the execution date or the time delta.\r\nOne user case that regularly comes up is that the users want to get the external task/dag id's schedule run time and do some automated logic vs trying to manually go look up the time and do a timedelta.\r\n\r\nThis allows us to build smarter functions. This pr also keeps the legacy way to keep backwards compatibility if only one arg is passed, and throws an error if more than 2 args are passed.\r\n\r\nA test case is written to pass two args to our function and make sure it passes/runs to success.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before creating PR: [x]\r\n\r\n- [x] Description above provides context of the change\r\n- [x]

is some debate about whether Celery autoscale actually works, as discussed in the comments to this PR:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/3989#issuecomment-535882666\r\n\r\nThis is also related to the discussion in this issue:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/8480\r\n\r\nI ran into this issue as well with Airflow (autoscale not working) and had a look at the celery code and I think the issue is that for the worker process count to grow this is dependent on the number of tasks the worker has claimed, known as the prefetch_count.  If the prefetch_count isn't above the worker process count, then the number of worker processes won't budge. It seems like a catch-22. Airflow runs into this problem because `worker_prefetch_multiplier` is set to 1 (and `task_acks_late` is set to True...setting this to False also bumps the prefetch_count).\r\n\r\nThis issue can be worked around by setting the `worker_prefetch_multiplier` setting to an int greater than 1.  In this PR I included a note about the implications of this in the config and a link to relevant documentation.   Currently in airflow `worker_prefetch_multiplier` is set to 1 so a worker can't prefetch and lay claim to more tasks than it has process workers.  So in theory setting this to 2 can get you into trouble if you have worker A that has 6 processes and has grabbed 10 tasks and the 6 tasks it is working on are long running causing the other 4 tasks to be blocked.  Meanwhile worker B just finished up processing its own 6 tasks and is available to work on the 4 that are backed up on worker A but A has already claimed those tasks.  If you are running one worker, though, then this shouldn't be a problem.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes `worker_prefetch_multiplier` configurable so that the user can get autoscale working if they feel that for their use case `worker_prefetch_multiplier` of greater than 1 won't be an issue.\r\n\r\nI also [opened up a Celery PR](https://github.com/celery/celery/pull/6069) with a suggested fix for this issue.\r\n\r\n---\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before creating PR: [x]\r\n\r\n- [X] Description above provides context of the change\r\n- [X] Unit tests coverage for changes (not needed for

adds a docker compose example to run Airflow installation.\r\n\r\nThe Compose defines multiple services to run Airflow. There is an init service which is an ephemeral container to initialize the database and creates a user if necessary. The init service command tries to run `airflow list_users` and if it fails it initializes the database and creates a user. Different approaches were considered but this one is simple enough and only involves airflow commands (no database-specific commands).\r\n\r\nExtension fields are used for airflow environment variables to reduce code duplication.\r\n\r\nI added some lines of documentation on `IMAGES.rst` but maybe there is a better place for that.\r\n\r\nIssues: #8605 #8606\r\n---\r\nMake sure to mark the

Currently in `master` and `1.10.10`, connection add/edit UI pages are not working correctly for Spark connections.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Current Connection Adding for Spark ('Spark' in not available):\r\n![Airflow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11539188/80908613-931fe680-8d21-11ea-9bcc-39c9abc1117e.png)\r\n\r\n## Current Connection Editing for Spark:\r\n![Airflow-2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11539188/80908617-9a46f480-8d21-11ea-87aa-2b59beac6459.png)\r\n\r\nYou can easily reproduce this by trying to edit default connection `spark_default`.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Root-cause\r\n\r\nThe root-cause is that \"spark\" is not listed in `models.Connection._types`. So when `www/forms.py` tries to produce the UI, \"spark\" is not available and it always tried to \"fall back\" to the option list whose first entry is \"Docker\" (this is why we see \"Docker Registry\" when we edit \"spark_default\").\r\n\r\nIn addition, we should hide irrelevant entries for spark connections (\"schema\", \"login\", and \"password\")\r\n\r\n## After Fix - Add Spark Connection\r\n![Airflow-3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11539188/80908691-3e30a000-8d22-11ea-96f2-25750c490a77.png)\r\n\r\n## After Fix - Edit Spark

Currently the task instance view does not show all runs anyways and rather shows just the number of times it ran this task for a given execution date. We need to remove these from the order_columns to prevent them from being clickable and rather have them be static.\r\n\r\nBecause this is a cosmetic change we have attached the UI shots from our instances within Pinterest and do not have any unit tests for this change.\r\n\r\nBefore this change you can see the try number is clickable. \r\n<img width=\"255\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-05-02 at 6

PR is aim to fix issue https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/8311\r\n\r\n#### Idea:\r\n\r\n1. Check if a task is still running.\r\n2. If so, disregard the duration field fetched from backend,\r\n3. calculate duration with current timestamp - ti.start_time\r\n\r\n#### Tooltip before fix:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2020-05-01 at 22 11 23](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/295515/80839203-10047080-8bfb-11ea-97af-5e9bc7fd6ef4.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Tooltip after fix:\r\n\r\n![screenshot1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/295515/85921198-d5295c80-b87a-11ea-887a-16604eff1a18.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe original bug of not showing duration at all on graph view is not the case on master branch, but, the value shows in the tooltip is not correct, since it is read from database and scheduler doesn't update duration frequently to reflect the actual duration till current timestamp for running tasks.\r\n\r\nNote: The bug reported in issue 8311 is on v1.10.10 but this PR is based on master branch. Since there are fundamental change between master and v1.10.10 branch, separate PR might be needed to for v1.10.10.\r\n\r\n---\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before creating PR: [x]\r\n\r\n- [x]

currently fails on Python 3.8. One reason is bc the new process start method changes from `fork` to `spawn`, which pickles the factory method used to create the new process. Currently, that method is an instance method, which causes failure during the pickling process. This PR moves the callback method to a standalone function, which won't be impacted by pickling\r\n\r\nThis also adds support for controlling preferred start method based on config values.\r\n\r\nThis

PR is to address issue https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/8662\r\n\r\nCurrently, task instances of `DummyOperators` are always marked as `SUCCESS` then immediately being skipped. Other entries like `start_date`, `end_date`, and `duration` are not marked for it in the database (in `task_instance` table in DB, `start_date`, `end_date`, and `duration` are all `NULL` for `DummyOperator` tasks).\r\n\r\nOne of the issues resulted from this is that when we hover over task instances of `DummyOperator` in RBAC UI, the started and ended times are always showing the CURRENT time, instead of the the actual task started and ended time (like other operators/sensors).\r\n\r\nFor details, please refer to https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/8662\r\n\r\n---\r\nMake sure to

PR is a part of [AIP-31], and closes the following issues:  \r\ncloses #8055, closes #8053,  closes #8052 .\r\nThe goal of the XComArg model is to create a communication token to be passed between operators. In this fashion, we can wire the output of one operator to the next in a functional and \"comfortable\" (code-writing-wise) manner.\r\nCollaborated with: @turbaszek @casassg

PR is a part of [AIP-31], and closes #8058 \r\nThe goal of this issue is to detach the execution context from the executing method's signature.\r\nBefore, the only way to retrieve execution context was via `**kwargs` in the function's signature.\r\nNow, it is possible to retrieve it using a simple external function call (only works when function is within execute context).\r\nThis develops AIP-31 to allow a more functional way of writing code, without being coupled to airflow's current implementation.\r\nCollaborated with: @turbaszek @casassg @evgenyshulman \r\n\r\n---\r\nMake sure to

use Snowflake with SSO, Okta, ADFS or any other SAML 2.0 compliant identify provider we need to pass the `authenticator=externalbrowser` extra parameter to the snowflake connection string. Currently the `authenticator` parameter not extracted from the connection extras JSON and not possible to use Airflow and Snowflake with SAML/SSO\r\n\r\nThis PR extracts the `authenticator` parameter from the connection \"extra\"s JSON and passing it to the snowflake uri. This allows to use Airflow and Snowflake configured with SAML/SSO. \r\n\r\nExample airflow connection config:\r\n```\r\nConn Id: <CONNECTION_ID>\r\nConn Type: Snowflake\r\nHost: <YOUR_SNOWFLAKE_HOSTNAME>\r\nSchema: <YOUR_SNOWFLAKE_SCHEMA>\r\nLogin: <YOUR_SNOWFLAKE_USERNAME>\r\nPassword: <YOUR_SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD>\r\nExtra: {\r\n        \"account\": <YOUR_SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT_NAME>,\r\n        \"warehouse\": <YOUR_SNOWFLAKE_WAREHOUSE_NAME>,\r\n         \"database\": <YOUR_SNOWFLAKE_DB_NAME>,\r\n         \"region\": <YOUR_SNOWFLAKE_HOSTED_REGION>,\r\n         \"authenticator\": \"externalbrowser\"\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nRelated snowflake documentation with the valid authentication strings: [Snowflake Python:

response payload of `/dag_stats` and `/task_stats` are like \r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"example_short_circuit_operator\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"state\": \"success\",\r\n            \"count\": 0,\r\n            \"dag_id\": \"example_short_circuit_operator\",\r\n            \"color\": \"green\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            \"state\": \"running\",\r\n

present as the key, but still repeatedly appear in each element,\r\nwhich makes the response payload size unnecessarily bigger. \r\n\r\nIn one of the tests I did, this change reduces the response payload size of `/task_stats` to 23Kb from 33Kb.\r\n\r\n---\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before creating PR: [x]\r\n\r\n- [x] Description above provides context of the change\r\n- [x] Unit

sure to mark the boxes below before creating PR: [x]\r\n\r\nAddress github issue #8619 \r\nWhen there is an inconsistency between executor event return state and DB state. It is hard to debug the root cause and for celery executor we need to query logs from all workers. The reason is that at this time DB hostname was not updated and we don't know which worker have picked up the task and caused the failure. If we have the hostname with the executor event, we will be able to identify the host and debug root cause on that host. It could reduce time and operations to find out problematic host.\r\n\r\nImplementation:\r\nChange value type of event_buffer from str state to tuple of state and info. Add hostname to the celery command failed exception information and pass celery info into event_buffer.\r\n\r\n- [x] Description above provides context of the change\r\n- [x] Unit tests coverage for

PR closes #8603, which seeks adding support for `.jinja2` for file templates across the project.\r\n\r\nIt defines a new property for `BaseOperator` which is a list containing `.jinja2` (and possibly other extensions if someone wants to add in the future), and whenever `template_ext` is not empty, the list is combined with it to produce a definite list of extensions, which is used throughout the class.\r\n\r\n---\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before creating PR: [x]\r\n\r\n- [x] Description above provides context of the change\r\n- [x] Unit tests coverage for changes (not needed for

the current implementation of the hive macros encoding the resultant from the metastore calls, in py2 this returns a string type still but in python3 encoding forces the representation to be a byte type. See the example below\r\n```\r\nahaidrey-078HTD6:incubator-airflow ahaidrey$ python3\r\nPython 3.7.0 (default, Oct  2 2018, 09:20:07)\r\n[Clang 10.0.0 (clang-1000.11.45.2)] on darwin\r\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\r\n>>> a = 'apple'\r\n>>> b = a.encode('utf-8')\r\n>>> type(b)\r\n<class 'bytes'>\r\n\r\nahaidrey-078HTD6:~ ahaidrey$ python\r\nPython 2.7.16 (default, Dec  3 2019, 02:03:47)\r\n[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 9.0.0 (clang-900.0.31)] on darwin\r\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\r\n>>> a = 'apple'\r\n>>> b = a.encode('utf-8')\r\n>>> type(b)\r\n<type 'str'>\r\n```\r\nThe issue with this is that the resultant for example being used by macros returns a byte type that isn't templatable as a string and breaks the queries it is used in. What this means is that all the templates need to be written as something like this:\r\n```\r\nval = \"{{ macros.hive.max_partition(table='mytable', schema='myschema', field='myfield', filter_map={'key1': 'val1'}).decode('utf-8') }}\"\r\n```\r\nRequiring from the users end to always decode the value is not the intention of this method and should use a value that can be returned as is.\r\n\r\nThis PR is to fix this ordeal. We may be able to just remove the encoding altogether but it could make things backwards incompatible.\r\n\r\n---\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before creating PR: [x]\r\n\r\n- [x] Description
