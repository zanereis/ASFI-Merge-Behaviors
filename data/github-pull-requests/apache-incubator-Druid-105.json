This is useful because partition columns are added incrementally so that typically we need to ingest added directories only. If not specified, set the same as `basePath`.\n`partitionColumns` are optional, and if not specified, automatically scan all `x=y` patterns for the given input file paths.\n","created_at":"2016-05-10T06:55:15Z","updated_at":"2019-03-07T08:10:21Z","closed_at":"2019-03-07T08:10:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"59805577114eb5979aa527213265677cd13e3574","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287687,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Feature","name":"Feature","color":"2ceefb","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1252153393,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjUyMTUzMzkz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"ffffff","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/2945/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/2945/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2945/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/statuses/14e0ba5c05b9ad429bfe58b2b3445d841141988c","head":{"label":"sirpkt:hadoop-index-partition-support","ref":"hadoop-index-partition-support","sha":"14e0ba5c05b9ad429bfe58b2b3445d841141988c","user":{"login":"sirpkt","id":4968993,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Njg5OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4968993?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirpkt","html_url":"https://github.com/sirpkt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirpkt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirpkt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirpkt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirpkt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirpkt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirpkt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirpkt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirpkt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirpkt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":45589174,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NTU4OTE3NA==","name":"druid","full_name":"sirpkt/druid","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sirpkt","id":4968993,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Njg5OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4968993?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirpkt","html_url":"https://github.com/sirpkt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirpkt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirpkt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirpkt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirpkt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirpkt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirpkt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirpkt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirpkt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirpkt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sirpkt/druid","description":"Column

PR adds a utility class called BenchmarkDataGenerator for randomly generating event rows for benchmarking purposes. \n\nEach column is independently generated (no cross-column relationships are supported), column configuration is handled by the BenchmarkColumnSchema class which defines properties like type, cardinality and distribution of values.\n\nThis PR also adds benchmarks for:\n- Adding rows to an IncrementalIndex (IndexIngestionBenchmark)\n- Persisting an IncrementalIndex (IndexPersistBenchmark)\n- Merging several segments (IndexMergeBenchmark)\n\nBasic benchmarks for each query type, running against a single segment with no filters or extraction functions, are added as well.\n\nEach query benchmark has the following 3 benchmarks:\n- Query a single IncrementalIndex and materialize the results\n- Query a single QueryableIndex and materialize the results\n- Query multiple QueryableIndex in parallel, with 1 thread per segment\n\nThe number of rows per segment, number of total segments, and other relevant configuration are specified as parameters to the benchmarks.\n\nEach benchmark references a schema defined in BenchmarkSchemas, with the schema to be used defined by a benchmark parameter. Currently there is one schema, \"basic\".\n\nEach query benchmark can have a set of supported queries per schema, currently each benchmark has one query defined for the \"basic\" schema. The choice of schema and query is specified by the \"schemaAndQuery\" parameter, using a schemaName.queryName

#1872.\n\nStill a couple TODOs, don't merge yet, just looking for feedback.\n\nThe idea is that when a groupBy query is ordered on the same dimensions it's grouping on, and doesn't have a having clause, then it's ok to apply the limit on partially merged results rather than waiting for fully merged results. This can speed up the query, and will also prevent it from hitting its maxResults limit if the limit threshold is less than maxResults.\n","created_at":"2016-04-20T20:40:08Z","updated_at":"2018-07-06T15:35:57Z","closed_at":"2016-05-18T23:08:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"158f3913aabff6ad56653e879786530eb321268e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":182900868,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxODI5MDA4Njg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Discuss","name":"Discuss","color":"ff00ff","default":false,"description":null},{"id":321808195,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMjE4MDgxOTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Improvement","name":"Improvement","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/2864/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/2864/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2864/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/statuses/3d345b89a64fc936a61529f4e86e2e88579233b1","head":{"label":"gianm:groupBy-push-limit","ref":"groupBy-push-limit","sha":"3d345b89a64fc936a61529f4e86e2e88579233b1","user":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":28350072,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODM1MDA3Mg==","name":"druid","full_name":"gianm/druid","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gianm/druid","description":"Real²time

PR adds functionality to specify \"druid.broker.segment.watchedDataSources\" which allows the broker to only listen for specific configured datasources. \n\nChanges in this PR include - \n1) Adding back FilteredServerView and related classes earlier removed in (https://github.com/druid-io/druid/commit/a32906c7fd11c9a8554df2621a172353a523a9dd)\n2) Extends the changes done in https://github.com/druid-io/druid/pull/2382 to use FilteredServerView so that the filtered segments are actually removed from broker heap\n3) Introduces new property

have been working on using Spark for long-running Druid queries. I was able to run a long-running druid query without timeout by having intermediate-level brokers that process the query for a specific chunk of segments and letting the final broker merge the query results from intermediate brokers. While doing so, I had to write my own query runners where one does stuff from `RetryQueryRunner` to `toolChest.mergeResults` and the other does stuff from `toolChest.mergeResults` to `FinalizeResultsQueryRunner`. @xvrl suggested refactoring `ClientQuerySegmentWalker` this way so I can use the methods from a new class instead of reusing the code from `ClientQuerySegmentWalker`.\n","created_at":"2016-04-14T01:30:35Z","updated_at":"2018-07-06T15:35:56Z","closed_at":"2016-04-18T21:00:47Z","merged_at":"2016-04-18T21:00:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"7b65ca78893576f7d4f50ab9c87aad922cc739f5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":321808195,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMjE4MDgxOTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Improvement","name":"Improvement","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/2837/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/2837/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/2837/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/statuses/3b0a96ad7f62ee0179702e2f151289bb91bf4032","head":{"label":"jisookim0513:refactor-client-query-segment-walker","ref":"refactor-client-query-segment-walker","sha":"3b0a96ad7f62ee0179702e2f151289bb91bf4032","user":{"login":"jisookim0513","id":3820496,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjA0OTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3820496?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jisookim0513","html_url":"https://github.com/jisookim0513","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jisookim0513/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jisookim0513/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jisookim0513/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jisookim0513/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jisookim0513/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jisookim0513/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jisookim0513/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jisookim0513/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jisookim0513/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":53085162,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MzA4NTE2Mg==","name":"druid","full_name":"jisookim0513/druid","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jisookim0513","id":3820496,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjA0OTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3820496?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jisookim0513","html_url":"https://github.com/jisookim0513","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jisookim0513/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jisookim0513/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jisookim0513/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jisookim0513/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jisookim0513/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jisookim0513/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jisookim0513/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jisookim0513/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jisookim0513/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jisookim0513/druid","description":"Column
