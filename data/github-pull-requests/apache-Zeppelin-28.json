What is this PR for?\r\nAfter [[ZEPPELIN-1588]: bumping nvd3 to 1.8.5](#2042) merged, Zeppelin was occurring front-end side error such as `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'x' of null` because of upgrading for `1.7.1` to `1.8.5`. \r\nAFAIK, this is a bug in `ndv3`, and ndv3 is still fixing the problem discussing [here](https://github.com/novus/nvd3/issues/330).\r\nAlso The latest release(1.8.5 version) scatter file and the master scatter file have a lot of changes, so we should wait for the next release.\r\nThus, I think we need to revert version from 1.8.5 to 1.7.1 for stable Zeppelin and our next 0.7.1 release.\r\n\r\n_Plus, when I check on current master of nvd3, scatter chart works well like this._\r\n![z_2229_master_check](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8110458/24280800/f1cd4caa-1096-11e7-8d68-bc831d9e228b.gif)\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Bug Fix]\r\n\r\n### What is

What is this PR for?\r\nI added pagination below Helium package list in https://zeppelin.apache.org/helium_packages.html by #2126. But after this, \"Lately published\" page doesn't show actual latest package first. It's because while i'm paginating the packages, I should've made ordering by `published` date first before [slicing package array](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/compare/gh-pages...AhyoungRyu:ZEPPELIN-2303/fixLatelyPublishedOrdering?expand=1#diff-c2c3af7bcb6c1faa231eaf25c15d3732R63).

That's the reason why `paragraphText` is written as a (global) service.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Bug Fix]\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n\r\nNONE\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n\r\n[ZEPPELIN-2301](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2301)\r\n\r\nRelated with \r\n\r\n- https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2120 (different approach)\r\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1492 (people are complaining on this issue. but different topic.)\r\n\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n\r\n1. Open the same note in 2 browsers (use different sessions e.g normal chrome + secret chrome or firefox + safari)\r\n2. Prepare a paragraph synchronized among sessions.\r\n3. Modify text in one browser.\r\n4. (Create, Delete) Rename other notes. The actions which triggering `NOTE` websocket messages should not overwrite local text change in editor.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n####

What is this PR for?\r\nLike I did in #2126, added pagination to Helium menu in Zeppelin. \r\n10 pkgs will be shown per 1 page. \r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nImprovement\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n[ZEPPELIN-2209](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2209)\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n1. Replace temporarily [ZeppelinConfiguration.java#L46](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/zeppelin-zengine/src/main/java/org/apache/zeppelin/conf/ZeppelinConfiguration.java#L46) with [this url](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AhyoungRyu/spark-notebook-example/master/helium.json)\r\n\r\n2. Build \\w below command and restart Zeppelin server\r\n```\r\n $ mvn clean package -DskipTests -pl 'zeppelin-zengine, zeppelin-server, zeppelin-interpreter'\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Start web dev server under `ZEPPELIN_HOME/zeppelin-web` and browse `localhost:9000`\r\n```\r\n$ yarn run dev\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. Go to Helium menu -> Click `INTERPRETER` btn \r\n(Currently the other types of pkg are registered in online registry less than 10. That's why I request to change online registry URI in step 1)\r\n5. Check the pagination works well or not\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n![record](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10060731/24182469/58ec965e-0f05-11e7-8cf9-eca7d36c0106.gif)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? no\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? no\r\n* Does this needs documentation? no\r\n","created_at":"2017-03-22T04:50:27Z","updated_at":"2017-03-31T01:54:05Z","closed_at":"2017-03-31T01:54:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1a441255a5a728bc0579a1aca16b6305562b7fa2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/2174/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/2174/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/2174/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/ceab2c5fa6fc6fffe18ac8d08667a265171d76b3","head":{"label":"AhyoungRyu:add/paginationToHeliumMenu","ref":"add/paginationToHeliumMenu","sha":"ceab2c5fa6fc6fffe18ac8d08667a265171d76b3","user":{"login":"AhyoungRyu","id":10060731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYwNzMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10060731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu","html_url":"https://github.com/AhyoungRyu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44792338,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDc5MjMzOA==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"AhyoungRyu/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AhyoungRyu","id":10060731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYwNzMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10060731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu","html_url":"https://github.com/AhyoungRyu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AhyoungRyu/zeppelin","description":"Mirror

What is this PR for?\r\nWhen you have a notebook under GIT version control, the dropdown with your commits will be cut-off with no possibility to scroll to older commits (see attached screenshot).\r\n\r\nThis fixes it by applying a relative max-height and appropriate overflow (similar styles as for the notebooks dropdown in the navigation bar). If the dropdown is longer than max-height, a scrollbar will be shown :)\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nBug Fix\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2291\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\nCreate a notebook under version control and make a couple of changes & commits, until the dropdown gets too long to fit on one screen.

Set `zeppelin.server.allowed.origins` in zeppelin-site.xml other than the default `*`. Eg. `xxxx`\r\n2. Start zeppelin\r\n3.

What is this PR for?\r\nTo address this feedback https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2100#issuecomment-286780437, I added more test cases to ensure `RunOnSelectionChange` works well.\r\n\r\nThe newly added test cases are like below. When we run this paragraph, one dropdown menu will be shown: \r\n```\r\n%md \r\nMy selection is ${my selection=1,1|2|3}\r\n```\r\n![screen shot 2017-03-20 at 4 00 20 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10060731/24090750/6a183e7c-0d86-11e7-8a66-60ed8008d2db.png)\r\n\r\n1. When `RunOnSelectionChange` is **true** (default)\r\nif we select \"2\" in the dropdown menu, the result text will be updated to \"My selection is 2\" right after the selection change. [See here](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/compare/master...AhyoungRyu:ZEPPELIN-2287/addTestForRunOnSelectionChange?expand=1#diff-48409cf8ca5ddb1aea1a62ada3cd091dR282)\r\n\r\n2. When `RunOnSelectionChange` is **false**\r\nIf we select \"1\" in the dropdown menu, the result text won't be updated to \"My selection is 1\" right after the selection change instead it'll be remained as \"My selection is 2\". [See here](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/compare/master...AhyoungRyu:ZEPPELIN-2287/addTestForRunOnSelectionChange?expand=1#diff-48409cf8ca5ddb1aea1a62ada3cd091dR295)\r\nBut we can run the paragraph by pressing `Enter`. After running the paragraph manually using `Enter`, then the result text will be updated to \"My selection is 1\" [See here](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/compare/master...AhyoungRyu:ZEPPELIN-2287/addTestForRunOnSelectionChange?expand=1#diff-48409cf8ca5ddb1aea1a62ada3cd091dR301)\r\n\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nAdd test case \r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n[ZEPPELIN-2287](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2287)\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\nAfter applying this patch, run \r\n```\r\nTEST_SELENIUM=\"true\" mvn package -DfailIfNoTests=false -pl 'zeppelin-interpreter,zeppelin-zengine,zeppelin-server' -Dtest=ParagraphActionsIT#testRunOnSelectionChange\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? no\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? no\r\n* Does this needs documentation? no\r\n","created_at":"2017-03-20T07:19:27Z","updated_at":"2017-03-28T13:26:56Z","closed_at":"2017-03-28T13:26:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"afda2e0250b7b769c299535d06d8ba42e0b2191e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/2163/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/2163/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/2163/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/79efddc15904ea75e9be6b11b906329d25cb838b","head":{"label":"AhyoungRyu:ZEPPELIN-2287/addTestForRunOnSelectionChange","ref":"ZEPPELIN-2287/addTestForRunOnSelectionChange","sha":"79efddc15904ea75e9be6b11b906329d25cb838b","user":{"login":"AhyoungRyu","id":10060731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYwNzMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10060731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu","html_url":"https://github.com/AhyoungRyu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44792338,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDc5MjMzOA==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"AhyoungRyu/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AhyoungRyu","id":10060731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYwNzMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10060731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu","html_url":"https://github.com/AhyoungRyu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AhyoungRyu/zeppelin","description":"Mirror

But currently if user creates multiple dynamic forms in one paragraph, the select form box itself[1] and `Run on selection` menu[2] don't appear  as reported in https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2141#issuecomment-287537706. \r\n\r\n - [1]\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10060731/24073544/4b477ec2-0c3c-11e7-95ae-d651c0180903.png)\r\n\r\n - [2]\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10060731/24073550/5b91998e-0c3c-11e7-9418-797a5d26aa67.png)\r\n \r\nRegardless the number of select forms and the types of dynamic form, `Run on selection change` menu should be shown up if the paragraph has at least 1 select form. \r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nBug Fix & Hot Fix\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n1. Create multiple select forms \r\n```\r\n%md \r\nMy first selection is ${my selection1=1,1|2|3}\r\nMy second selection is ${my selection2=4,4|5|6}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Create different types of dynamic form (e.g. 1 select form + 1 checkbox)\r\n```\r\n%md\r\n\r\nMy selection is ${my selection=1,1|2|3}\r\nMy check list is ${checkbox:checkboxTest=list1|list2, list1|list2|list3|list4}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere should be `Run on selection change` menu under the paragraph control menu in the above cases.

What is this PR for?\r\nIf using the `multiChartBar`, it often occurs overlap in text. So, this PR is for preventing to overlap in text. \r\n\r\n>~~The below is the case what I updated.~~\r\n~~1. The xLabel generally show all of the text without rotation (less than 30).~~\r\n~~2. If the xLabel size is over than 30 and less than 80, the xLabel text are rotated as 90 degree and displayed.~~\r\n~~3. If the xLabel size is over than 80, the xLabel text are disappeared, but the tooltip is displayed.~~\r\n>~~I have made improvements based on my thinking, so I would appreciate to give me your feedback.~~\r\n~~And if merged this PR, I'll update the feature so that user can use `min` and `max` variables by user on web.~~\r\n\r\n**[Update]**\r\nTo prevent overlap in xLabel text, in one way which is talked the below mentions, user who is using zeppelin could select to visualization type of xLabel such as `rotate 45 degree` or `hide`.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Bug Fix | Improvement ]\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* [ZEPPELIN-1357; UI - label wrapping not done properly in charts](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1357)\r\n* [ZEPPELIN-1892; Display label vertically or horizontally smartly](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1892)\r\n* [ZEPPELIN-1370; Label overlaps - in default visualization example barchart](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1370)\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n1.

What is this PR for?\r\nAfter #2037 merged, we can see `INTERPRETER` type in Helium menu. So for the consistency, it'll be better we can show`INTERPRETER` type in https://zeppelin.apache.org/helium_packages.html. So what I did in this PR is \r\n - enabled to see `INTERPRETER` type \r\n - added a pagination\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nImprovement\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [x] - update overview sentences\r\n(current overview sentences are only for npm package related description. But`INTERPRETER` type pkgs come from mvn central not npm registry. So need to update accordingly)\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* [ZEPPELIN-2110](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2110) : List community & 3rd party interpreter registered at Maven central repo in Helium menu \r\n* [ZEPPELIN-2209](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2209) : Add pagination\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n1. To see `INTERPRETER` type pkg, replace [helium online registry uri](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/gh-pages/_includes/themes/zeppelin/default.html#L34) with `<script src=\"https://rawgit.com/AhyoungRyu/spark-notebook-example/master/helium-fake.js\"></script>`\r\n2. Run the website(`gh-pages`) locally as described in [here](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/tree/gh-pages#run-website)\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n![record](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10060731/23833560/254de8b0-078b-11e7-8083-4bd846f2fbfc.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? no\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? no\r\n* Does this needs documentation? yes need to update overview sentences as I said in TODO\r\n","created_at":"2017-03-12T16:23:37Z","updated_at":"2017-03-17T04:28:46Z","closed_at":"2017-03-17T04:28:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fd0e21f115bf4e62d13fbee63c8a5e2dd6c72f69","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/2126/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/2126/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/2126/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/1ee2a2a69fb86879f083a1b7a18227c1cc6b644a","head":{"label":"AhyoungRyu:add/interpreterTypePkg","ref":"add/interpreterTypePkg","sha":"1ee2a2a69fb86879f083a1b7a18227c1cc6b644a","user":{"login":"AhyoungRyu","id":10060731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYwNzMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10060731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu","html_url":"https://github.com/AhyoungRyu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44792338,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDc5MjMzOA==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"AhyoungRyu/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AhyoungRyu","id":10060731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYwNzMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10060731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu","html_url":"https://github.com/AhyoungRyu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AhyoungRyu/zeppelin","description":"Mirror

What is this PR for?\r\nZeppelin's JDBC interpreter sometimes doesn't show detailed error message on the notebook ui. It shows only plain \"ERROR\" text near run button in case of failure. User has to check JDBC interpreter log file in order to see a detailed error message.\r\n\r\nThis is mostly in case of incompatible JAR and I see errors mentioned below;\r\n```\r\njava.lang.NoSuchMethodError: org.apache.curator.utils.ZKPaths.fixForNamespace(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/String;Z)Ljava/lang/String;\r\n\tat org.apache.curator.framework.imps.NamespaceImpl.fixForNamespace(NamespaceImpl.java:82)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\njava.lang.NoSuchMethodError: org.apache.hive.service.auth.HiveAuthFactory.getSocketTransport(Ljava/lang/String;II)Lorg/apache/hive/org/apache/thrift/transport/TTransport;\r\n\tat org.apache.hive.jdbc.HiveConnection.createBinaryTransport(HiveConnection.java:447)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHence, IMO instead of catch -> Exception; we should use catch ->Throwable.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Improvement]\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* [ZEPPELIN-2175](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2175)\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\nUse any incompatible in interpreter dependency, which would throw Error instead of Exception.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? N/A\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? N/A\r\n* Does this needs documentation?

What is this PR for?\r\n\r\nThis pull request fixes two issues regarding paragraphs not being updated and therefore overwritten unintentionally. The first issue yields to local changes being overwritten when remote changes are made. The second issue yields to changes being overwritten when, e.g., the notebook is renamed.\r\n\r\nThe first change happens in the `updateParagraph` broadcast event handler function. This function has the purpose to update the local state of the paragraph in the paragraph controller scope when there is an update from the web socket.\r\n\r\nHowever, it did not update the state if the only thing that has changed was the text. Now it will, which fixes the original issue in the issue description. This was one of the issues identified by https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1492?focusedCommentId=15744928&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-15744928\r\n\r\nThe second issue is fixed by saving the paragraph when the editor loses focus.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n\r\nBug Fix\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n\r\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1492\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n\r\nThe first issue can be reproduced with the following two browser-windows and a single notebook.\r\n\r\nBrowser A:\r\n\r\n```\r\n%pyspark\r\nprint \"Original Zeppelin Notebook\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn Browser B, edit the notebook and the above command to:\r\n\r\n```\r\n%pyspark\r\nprint \"Notebook is updated....\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I run the notebook via browser A followed by Browser B, everything is updated nicely. Now also if I you add the following line to the Notebook though Browser B:\r\n\r\n```\r\nprint \"....once again\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nand run the notebook through Browser B again, the content in Browser A will be updated.\r\n\r\nThe second issue can be reproduced by editing a cell without executing it and renaming the notebook right afterwards. The rename will reset your cell to the previous state. With the fix, your state is saved.\r\n","created_at":"2017-03-10T12:44:55Z","updated_at":"2017-04-04T19:57:24Z","closed_at":"2017-04-04T19:57:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0d81eb90ec6a50348c0224548ca5426f6e150c9c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/2120/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/2120/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/2120/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/be28a5d5001064d36e7164a0b368855ad7495863","head":{"label":"FRosner:ZEPPELIN-1492","ref":"ZEPPELIN-1492","sha":"be28a5d5001064d36e7164a0b368855ad7495863","user":{"login":"FRosner","id":3427394,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjczOTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3427394?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FRosner","html_url":"https://github.com/FRosner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FRosner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FRosner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FRosner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FRosner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FRosner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FRosner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FRosner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FRosner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FRosner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":56618213,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NjYxODIxMw==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"FRosner/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"FRosner","id":3427394,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjczOTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3427394?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FRosner","html_url":"https://github.com/FRosner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FRosner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FRosner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FRosner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FRosner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FRosner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FRosner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FRosner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FRosner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FRosner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/FRosner/zeppelin","description":"Mirror

What is this PR for?\r\nBefore travis build:\r\n* check if any bower.json file is part of the commit range\r\n* check if any commit message of the commit range contains \"bower clear\" or \"clear bower\"\r\n* If one of the above, clear bower_components, npm cache clear\r\nThis should prevent breaking the build when upgrading a js lib.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nImprovement\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [ ] - Task\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n[ZEPPELIN-2230](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2230)\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n\r\n1. Using this version of .travis.yml, build the project once. (e.g. with nvd3 1.7.1)\r\n2. then modify a version of js lib (e.g. nvd3), rebuild.\r\n3. Verify the build goes through, check the build log for the message \"Clearing bower_components cache\".\r\n4. Rebuild, without changing a version, but putting \"bower clean\" in a commit message. \r\n5. Same as 3.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? No\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\r\n* Does this needs documentation? Maybe for the \"bower clear\" trigger.
