SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis adds an ARM build to the superset. This is a naive implementation with buildx and QEMU. I'll be parallelizing these builds before this can get merged (now it takes like 1+ hours to compile)\r\n\r\nNotably i've changed:\r\n\r\n- build docker images with buildx\r\n- [Firefox installation](https://github.com/seleniumhq-community/docker-seleniarm/blob/trunk/NodeFirefox/Dockerfile.multi-arch) is taken from great selenium-arm image.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Run builds in parallel and merge manifests at the end\r\n- [ ] Sync firefox to the same version as current image\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nI've enabled Github Actions on my fork, so you can see the result:\r\n\r\n- http://hub.docker.com/r/hhhonzik/superset\r\n- Action detail: https://github.com/hhhonzik/superset/actions/runs/5849184577\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [x] Has associated issue: https://github.com/amancevice/docker-superset/issues/175\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible\r\n  - [ ] Confirm DB migration upgrade and downgrade tested\r\n  - [ ] Runtime estimates and downtime expectations provided\r\n- [ ] Introduces new feature or

https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/24586 to  update the schema to point to the new one. The PostSchema no longer exists, so it was failing a test in the 2.1.1 release. \r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nThe test in master isn't failing with the Post schema, likely because of some

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis is a PR I've had on the back-burner for many months, but have struggled with on numerous occasions‚Äîoften in part due to the flakey/delicate tests (and their associated frameworks). The initial desire was to fulfill the approach outlined in [[SIP-99B] Proposal for (re)defining a \"unit of work\"](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/25108), but alas I failed, in part due to the challenges trying to untangle Superset logic which inherently is not overly conducive to adhering to the construct that a command should serve as a \"unit of work\".\r\n\r\nWhy is that? It's complicated, but asynchronous logic does not help given that a Celery task running within the confines of another command needs to read a previously committed state given the `READ COMMITTED` isolation level. Issues like this could likely be overcome by having two commands‚Äîprepare and execute‚Äîas opposed to a single execute command. \r\n\r\nThe TL;DR is this PR should likely be interpreted as the first phase of SIP-99B. The general framework holds, i.e., DAOs no longer commit and a `transaction` decorator is used to wrap any command which perform either an `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE`.\r\n\r\nFinally, I apologize for the size of the PR. I struggled to downside the footprint, but once you start enforcing that DAOs should not commit, then the files which touched begins to snowball.\r\n\r\nRegrettably my time (for now) working on Apache Superset is likely drawing to a close, so for completeness I thought there was merit in [sharing the incremental diff](https://github.com/john-bodley/superset/compare/john-bodley--dao-nested-session...john-bodley:superset:john-bodley--dao-nested-session-phase-2?expand=1) for what I was hoping to achieve in case @michael-s-molina @villebro et al. wanted to carry the baton on.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR adds the volunteer organization [wattbewerb](https://wattbewerb.de/) to the users list.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\nWattbewerb is a volunteer association pushing for accelerated PV installation and transition to green energy. We create a weekly updated ranking which compares the installed PV capacity per capita for each participating German municipality.\r\n\r\nFor each municipality, we provide a publicly available dashboard (via [this ranking page](https://plattform.wattbewerb.de/ranking)) to monitor the municipalities progress as well as data quality issues.\r\n\r\nTo improve readability for our German users, we contributed i.e. to superset's German

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThe recent upgrade on Pandas from 1.5.3 to 2.0.3 broke some features. In this PR we fix a regression where a column with a full ISO timestamp (`2017-07-01T00:00:00.000Z`) can't be configured with the Python date format \"%Y-%m-%d\" because in Pandas 2.0 the format should match the whole string by default.\r\n\r\nI changed the relevant calls to `to_datetime` to have `exact=False`, to preserve the behavior from Pandas 1.5.3.\r\n\r\nOne additional problem is that we had `errors=\"coerce\"` in the call, which returns `NaN` if something goes wrong. I changed to to `\"raise\"`, since I think it's a better experience. Otherwise the user has no idea of why their data is missing.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nRefactoring the Pinot plugin for Superset to bring it inline with how plugins operate in the latest version of Superset.\r\n\r\nThis refactoring is also addressing two bugs in the Apache Pinot DB Engine spec:\r\n1. If a column was marked as `temporal` and no time grain was provided then the query would be constructed with illegal `{}` around the column name causing Pinot to reject the query as syntactically invalid. The code has been updated to remove the incorrect `{}`\r\n2. In some cases, `get_timestamp_expr` will be called by `models.adhoc_column_to_sqla` and `None` is explicitly passed for the `pdf` parameter. This would cause the Pinot `get_timestamp_expr` to fault. To fix this, the `models.adhoc_column_to_sqla` method is updated to get the `python_date_format` for a column (if that data is available). (Without this fix, queries created for charts simply do _not_ use the date format a user sets for a temporal column).\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n1. Connected to a Pinot data set and marked a `long` column as `epoch_ms` and tested creating a Bar Chart V2 to confirm that the query would be correctly constructed (this tested the issue where `None` is passed for the `pdf` parameter.\r\n2. Setting a String column as temporal and using `%Y-%m-%d` as the PDF value and confirming that when a chart is created the correct Date Time conversion function is used to parse the text date time.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nAdd a separate DB engine spec for [MotherDuck](https://motherduck.com/), a cloud version of DuckDB. While adding the spec I did a few QoL improvements:\r\n\r\n- Fixed the \"Refer to the [SQLAlchemy docs](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/core/engines.html) for more information on how to structure your URI.\" text, which said only \"Refer to the for more information on how to structure your URI.\"\r\n- Display the `sqlalchemy_uri_placeholder` as the placeholder for the SQLAlchemy URI.\r\n- Add the optional `duckdb` dependency to Superset, with the library needed to run DuckDB and connect to MotherDuck.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nBefore, using the DuckDB driver, note that we show the generic placeholder and that the text is missing the link to the docs:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2023-08-09 at 08-54-23 Superset](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/1534870/dd62191d-84bb-4ebf-940d-6b12841d93be)\r\n\r\nAfter, we show the correct placeholder, and the text is fixed:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2023-08-09 at 08-52-00 Superset](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/1534870/0831c68c-cd5f-4d17-ba33-e9d0e5c051c5)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nWe noticed that `Select` options were being duplicated when searching for a value in numerical filters. It turns out that Ant Design Select can't have options with numerical values when mode equals `tags`. It displays the following warning:\r\n\r\n`Warning: value of Option should not use number type when mode is tags or combobox`\r\n\r\nTo overcome this limitation, this PR changes the mode to `multiple` and implement missing features such as allowing new values and copy and paste.\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/24877\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nI added a test to the component but we need to check the general use of selects in the application because there are wrappers that override the component behavior such as `SelectControl` and `SelectFilterPlugin`.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible\r\n  - [ ] Confirm DB migration upgrade and downgrade tested\r\n  - [ ] Runtime estimates and downtime expectations provided\r\n- [ ] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or API\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-07T15:05:20Z","updated_at":"2024-03-08T17:25:30Z","closed_at":"2023-08-11T17:22:16Z","merged_at":"2023-08-11T17:22:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"b621ee92c9124e2e2f7c988302eb0f77f00c9fc9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"rusackas","id":812905,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMjkwNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/812905?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas","html_url":"https://github.com/rusackas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"betodealmeida","id":1534870,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzQ4NzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1534870?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida","html_url":"https://github.com/betodealmeida","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"eschutho","id":5186919,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxODY5MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5186919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho","html_url":"https://github.com/eschutho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"yousoph","id":10627051,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNjI3MDUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10627051?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yousoph","html_url":"https://github.com/yousoph","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yousoph/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yousoph/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yousoph/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yousoph/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yousoph/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yousoph/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yousoph/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yousoph/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yousoph/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"jinghua-qa","id":81597121,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNTk3MTIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81597121?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinghua-qa","html_url":"https://github.com/jinghua-qa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinghua-qa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinghua-qa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinghua-qa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinghua-qa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinghua-qa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinghua-qa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinghua-qa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinghua-qa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinghua-qa/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently async queries executed in Chart view cannot be stopped. \r\n\r\nTo stop a running query in the backend the following changes were required:\r\n- use existing `job_id` (a random UUID that is returned to frontend) as celery task id\r\n- endpoint `DELETE /api/v1/chart/async_job/<string:job_id>` to terminate/revoke Celery task with a given task id\r\n- close db cursors for engines that use it to cancel a running query (e.g. Trion client)\r\n\r\nIn frontend we need to call endpoint to stop an async query when:\r\n- AbortController communicates an abort signal ('Stop' button was clicked)\r\n- Chart component will unmount\r\n- beforeunload event is fired\r\n\r\nFrontend keeps job id returned by backend in chart state. \r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nEnable and configure `GLOBAL_ASYNC_QUERIES` feature. Next go to Chart view, execute a long running query, and verify that Celery task is terminated and query in database is cancelled when:\r\n- 'Stop' button is clicked\r\n- Chart view is changed (e.g. click 'Home' tab)\r\n- browser tab is closed\r\n- browser tab is refreshed\r\n\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\"

SUMMARY\r\nDo not switch this button on the basis of the name of the role, instead use the relevant permission: `[SQL Lab].[menu_access]`, which is allocated to that role as standard.\r\n\r\nThis prevents issues where the user has the correct permission but via some other role.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

permissions to use SQL Lab, but not the role named `sql_lab`, click the three dots next to the datasource name in the chart editor and note that the \"View in SQL Lab\" button now appears as

[eslint-config-prettier](https://github.com/prettier/eslint-config-prettier) from 8.10.0 to 9.0.0.\n<details>\n<summary>Changelog</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/prettier/eslint-config-prettier/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md\">eslint-config-prettier's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3>Version 9.0.0 (2023-08-05)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Added: The CLI helper tool now works with eslint.config.js (flat config). Just like ESLint itself, the CLI tool automatically first tries eslint.config.js and then eslintrc, and you can force which one to use by setting the [ESLINT_USE_FLAT_CONFIG] environment variable. Note that the <em>config</em> of eslint-config-prettier has always been compatible with eslint.config.js (flat config) ‚Äì it was just the CLI tool that needed updating. On top of that, the docs have been updated to mention how to use both eslint.config.js (flat config) and eslintrc, and the tests now test both config systems.</li>\n<li>Changed: [unicode-bom] is no longer turned off. Prettier preserves the BOM if you have one, and does not add one if missing. It was wrong of eslint-config-prettier to disable that rule. If you get ESLint errors after upgrading, either add <code>&quot;unicode-bom&quot;: &quot;off&quot;</code> to your config to disable it again, or run ESLint with <code>--fix</code> to fix all files according to the rule (add or remove BOM).

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR uses [contextlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html)'s `suppress` for passing a specific error, instead of `pass`ing in an exception handler. The context manager shortens the code a bit and explicitly states the authors intend to ignore specific errors, thus improving readability.\r\n\r\nAlso, if I found the possibility, I used the walrus (`:=`) operator.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nrun unit and integration tests\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis change shouldn't have any impact on the behavior of the application outside of maybe a small performance hit when deleting many objects at once.  Note additionally that this is the default method of deletion used by the `BaseDAO`.\r\n\r\nThe motivation behind the change is that at Preset we'd like the ability to utilize the `after_delete` sqlalchemy listener hooks for these objects, and these aren't triggered for bulk deletes.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis PR reverts https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/24808. Regrettably @Vitor-Avila after further review I believe the logic outlined in your fix (per the integration test you added) exposes a security vulnerability, i.e., per this check in your test,\r\n\r\n```python\r\nsecurity_manager.raise_for_access(datasource=test_dataset)\r\n```\r\n\r\nwill mean said user will have access to the `test_dataset` datasource irrespective of the context. Thus by granting dashboard access to to a guest user you would be in fact (possibly unknowingly) granting full access to all datasources which are referenced within the native dashboard filters.\r\n\r\nI think the right‚Äîcontext aware‚Äîsolution is to change the `raise_for_access` caller to include the dashboard context. Note in https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/24804 I've refactored the dashboard security logic by folding `raise_for_dashboard_access` into `raise_for_access` so the later is (or can be dashboard aware).\r\n\r\nThe TL;DR is your change flexes to accommodate the need for the dashboard filters to function but is over generous in terms of the context in which the permissions are allowed.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nCI.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nCurrently, a bug exists in Superset where sometimes when updating a dataset's schema, the dataset and any charts belonging to the dataset do not have their `schema_perm` attribute get updated properly.  I've identified that this bug is the result of [this line](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/554ef07eeda094f5bcc081e7a265e0b7408e0868/superset/security/manager.py#L1368) which checks if a dataset's schema was changed after a dataset update.  Usually when the schema changes, both conditions are true/truthy, however sometimes `history_schema.deleted` is empty/falsy, which results in the `schema_perm` not getting updated.  I was not able to find a cause for this inconsistency.\r\n\r\nThis PR does not actually fix this bug; it just fixes any currently affected charts and datasets.  The reasoning behind this is that there was another bug [recently fixed](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/24815) which caused some datasets to be created without a schema, resulting in users needing the update dataset schemas more frequently than usual.  This made the `schema_perm` bug here more impactful.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, actually fixing this bug is not simple. I initially thought we could remove the `history_schema.deleted` condition, but it turns out that the other condition `history_schema.has_changes()`  is pretty much always true even when the schema has not changed, which would result in many unnecessary queries.  I believe the long-term fix for this is either to move away from sqlalchemy event listeners/attribute history and instead handle this logic in the DAO layer and/or to rehaul the data model for data access permissions so that these permission strings are no longer needed\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nWhen a legacy chart converted to the echart, there's a chance that non time range filter has been added in the adhoc_filters.

regression introduced in https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/24694. Specifically [previously](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/24694/files#diff-359940b6f6470257ed49fa39b82361ccb50a826407072043843a36a0ed6ce4e9L842) the legacy `TableViz` returned both the records and the columns associated with the records, however per [here](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/24694/files#diff-d3bf055ecf6a74aa0acbb0650d176b6c251aea7796543f77a2df3fd8b7e4c4b4R738) the new formulation only returned the records resulting in the annotation layer being [deemed](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/b71541fb7fb1bdfd3e1eea59ee76de1f51e67e6b/superset-frontend/packages/superset-ui-core/src/query/types/AnnotationLayer.ts#L181-L185) invalid by the frontend.\r\n\r\nRather than also explicitly including the column names (which is also redundant as the names are included in the records) this PR simply removes them as they're superfluous and not used by the frontend anywhere.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nCI and ran an end-to-end test

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nA lot of console errors have been creeping into the repo, and failing silently. These really only get noticed by random devs/users now when clicking around. \r\n\r\nThis PR won't systemically resolve these, but it will fail whey Cypress randomly encounter them during E2E tests.\r\n\r\nThis PR now swallows all console errors that would otherwise fail CI with this plugin installed. This is a new pile of tech debt. Now that we have disables failure on \"preexisiting conditions\" in this PR, we can stop the addition of further error types (particularly ones that sneak in with package bumps. \r\n\r\nThe rest of these should be addressed in subsequent PRs, to systemically get rid of these errors, or at least fine-tune the overrides from this PR to be more specific (in individual files/tests, etc).\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\nE2E now passes, and you can see all the errors this swallows to do so.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant

SUMMARY\r\n`webpack-dev-server` 4.12.0 added a new feature to [show runtime errors in the error overlay](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/pull/4605) by default which resulted in  `ResizeObserver` errors when running Superset in development mode. \r\n\r\n<img width=\"1048\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-08-02 at 09 56 17\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/70410625/895cbe9a-f46c-4a5b-8350-e3cd52a3f854\">\r\n\r\nWe only have one use of `ResizeObserver` in our codebase and it's not the root cause for the error, so it must be coming from a third party dependency. Given that this type of error is [benign](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49384120/resizeobserver-loop-limit-exceeded), we even have discussions to [downgrade it to a warning](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/5023), this PR changes the Webpack [configuration](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/#overlay) to ignore related error messages.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nMake sure the referenced error does not happen when running the application in development mode.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible\r\n  - [ ] Confirm DB migration upgrade and downgrade tested\r\n  - [ ] Runtime estimates and downtime expectations provided\r\n- [ ] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or API\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-02T13:29:57Z","updated_at":"2024-03-08T17:25:52Z","closed_at":"2023-08-02T14:41:21Z","merged_at":"2023-08-02T14:41:21Z","merge_commit_sha":"434db0d686ae246a0fd7a7b31dba856f63ae2b16","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"rusackas","id":812905,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMjkwNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/812905?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas","html_url":"https://github.com/rusackas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"justinpark","id":1392866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzOTI4NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1392866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinpark","html_url":"https://github.com/justinpark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinpark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinpark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinpark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinpark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinpark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinpark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinpark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinpark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinpark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"john-bodley","id":4567245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjcyNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4567245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley","html_url":"https://github.com/john-bodley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-bodley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1329183122,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzI5MTgzMTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/size/XS","name":"size/XS","color":"E2D8FF","default":false,"description":""},{"id":6578403540,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAlosUs8AAAABiBp41A","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/%F0%9F%8F%B7%EF%B8%8F%20bot","name":"üè∑Ô∏è

SUMMARY\r\nWhen saving a chart in Explore, we have different states:\r\n- If a user is overriding a chart or creating a new one\r\n- If a user is selecting a dashboard or creating a new one\r\n- If a user can override a chart or not\r\n\r\nCurrently, the Save modal buttons change to accommodate different combination of states:\r\n- Save\r\n- Save as new chart\r\n- Save to new dashboard\r\n- Save & go to dashboard\r\n- Save & go to new dashboard\r\n\r\nThe problem is that are missing some combinations which leads to confusion when saving charts:\r\n- Save as new chart to new dashboard\r\n- Save as new chart & go to dashboard\r\n- Save as new chart & go to new dashboard\r\n\r\nOne example of such confusion is when a user is not an owner of a chart but can save that chart as a new one. The button displays Save & go to dashboard which leads the user to think that a chart will be overridden in that dashboard but what actually happens is that a new chart is created and added to the dashboard. One can argue that the Save as radio selection would be sufficient to indicate the difference but that's not the case. Specially because we're changing the buttons text for some states and not for others. \r\n\r\nTo fix this, my first attempt was to make sure the button labels accounted for all possible states but that resulted in a poor UI as you can see bellow:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"748\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-08-01 at 13 11 06\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/70410625/44682cf1-2f2d-4056-bdcd-fb2d7685f86e\">\r\n\r\n<br>A better solution was to change the modal to preserve the button labels and add an information message when creating a new chart, a dashboard or both:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"599\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-08-01 at 15 48 24\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/70410625/8a96cd80-f84c-4876-806b-3df7b9e85d2c\">\r\n\r\n<br>This message only appears when it's not clear that a new asset will be created. If a user is creating a chart for the first time and adding it to an existing dashboard, no message is displayed.\r\n\r\nThis PR also moves the alert message to the bottom, similar to the native filters modal, closer to the dashboard select and save button which are the sources for the alert.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"599\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-08-01 at 15 54 18\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/70410625/0b263669-b2d3-4de9-aed7-fa1900444786\">\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nMake sure the correct information message is displayed or not depending on the chart state.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible\r\n  - [ ] Confirm DB migration upgrade and downgrade

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nWe are currently unable to stop trino queries, because the underlying trino client blocks until the query completes, and doesn't make the query ID or any other info available in the meantime. Unfortunately it doesn't look like they plan to change that any time soon, either.\r\n\r\nMake the following changes:\r\n  - Add a new method execute_with_cursor to db_engine_spec which combines execute with handle_cursor, factoring it out of the one place it's used, deep in the execute query logic.\r\n  - Make handle_cursor poll the cursor for query ID, as it's going to be populated asynchronously. Add warnings that the trino impl will require using execute_with_cursor. Currently nothing is directly calling handle_cursor, with the one original call eliminated.\r\n  - Override execute_with_cursor for the trino engine and execute the two tasks in parallel to allow us to poll for the query ID while the query is still blocking.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\nTest that trino queries can be stopped in SQL Lab, that database errors from trino are still reported correctly, and that queries in other engines still run / stop correctly.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nCurrently the only thing you can configure via the environment without separate configuration file is the Flask `SECRET_KEY`. This means when running superset as a docker image you pretty much always need to wrap it within your own docker image first. As running a docker image, which is supposed to be immutable, with an embedded sqlite db is also quite limited in its usefulness it would be great to at least be able to point the default docker image to some external db.\r\n\r\nSo this change allows to set a new ENV variable `SUPERSET_DATABASE_URI` which allows it to deploy a useful superset docker image directly. I followed the naming of `SUPERSET_SECRET_KEY` to stay consistent.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nCurrently, attempting to overwrite a chart via import fails when the chart in the import file points to a dataset other than the one the chart currently points at.\r\n\r\nThis is because of the following filter which gets added to the query that checks if the chart being imported already exists:\r\n```python\r\nfilters.extend([getattr(cls, k) == dict_rep.get(k) for k in parent_refs.keys()])\r\n```\r\nwhich for charts evalulates to\r\n```python\r\nfilters.extend([Slice.datasource_id == dict_rep.get(\"datasource_id\")])\r\n```\r\nWhen the chart's dataset has been changed, the query fails to find the chart even if a chart with the same UUID exists. It then attempts to create the chart since it thinks it doesn't exist, which obviously fails the UUID uniqueness constraint.\r\n\r\nThis PR allows for charts to be \"re-parented\" to another dataset on import by removing this filter for chart imports, which can be useful when importing and exporting assets between environments after making changes, or for managing assets as code.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n1. Have a database connection with a dataset\r\n2. Create a virtual dataset identical to the dataset (`SELECT * FROM <physical_dataset>`)\r\n3. Create a chart for each dataset\r\n4. Do a bulk export with both of these charts\r\n5. Extract the export file \r\n6. Navigate to the charts folder and swap the `dataset_uuid` values for the charts\r\n7. Compress the file\r\n8. Import it back into the Superset instance\r\n9. See the charts have swapped datasets\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue
