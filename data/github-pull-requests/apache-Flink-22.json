you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n[FLINK-33982][core] Introduce new config options for Batch Job Recovery\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nIntroduce new config options for Batch Job Recovery\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\nReorganize job configuration\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n1. Migrate configuration from non-ConfigOption objects to use ConfigOption.\r\n2. Adopt a single Configuration object to house all configurations.\r\n3. Create complex Java objects, such as RestartBackoffTimeStrategyFactory, CheckpointStorage, and StateBackend, directly from the configuration on the JM side.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Add restore tests for TableSink node*\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n- Added restore tests for TableSink node which verifies the generated compiled plan with the saved compiled plan.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAdd new SinkV2 API interfaces, set inheritance and deprecation for the old interfaces.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nAll the new API's defined in [FLIP-372](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/FLIP-372%3A+Enhance+and+synchronize+Sink+API+to+match+the+Source+API)\r\n\r\nOne minor additional change:\r\n- Added `map` to `CommittableSummary` and `CommittableWithLineage` so it will be easier to map when the types are changed.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThe existing tests should run without issue, to verify the backward compatibility.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API,

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Add restore tests for TableSourceScan node*\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n- Added restore tests for TableSourceScan node which verifies the generated compiled plan with the saved compiled plan.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector:  (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable)\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-03T04:02:15Z","updated_at":"2024-04-04T09:58:56Z","closed_at":"2024-01-11T09:40:24Z","merged_at":"2024-01-11T09:40:23Z","merge_commit_sha":"e98ded88876e4b95922123481c38b215ab15b3e3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1285080206,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjg1MDgwMjA2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/Planner","name":"component=TableSQL/Planner","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24020/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/24020/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/24020/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/757f6ebbbf0fa6c253ed7494201450e6775b4565","head":{"label":"bvarghese1:table_scan_restore_tests","ref":"table_scan_restore_tests","sha":"757f6ebbbf0fa6c253ed7494201450e6775b4565","user":{"login":"bvarghese1","id":10199670,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTk5Njcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10199670?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1","html_url":"https://github.com/bvarghese1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":639592192,"node_id":"R_kgDOJh9nAA","name":"flink","full_name":"bvarghese1/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bvarghese1","id":10199670,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTk5Njcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10199670?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1","html_url":"https://github.com/bvarghese1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bvarghese1/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n[FLINK-33816][streaming] Fix unstable test SourceStreamTaskTest.testTriggeringStopWithSavepointWithDrain\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n[FLINK-33816][streaming] Fix unstable test SourceStreamTaskTest.testTriggeringStopWithSavepointWithDrain\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes.

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n[FLINK-33960][Scheduler] Fix the bug that Adaptive Scheduler doesn't respect the lowerBound when one flink job has more than 1 tasks\r\n\r\nWhen we using the adaptive scheduler and the rescale api, users will set the lowerBound and upperBound for each job vertices. And users expect the parallelism of all vertices between lowerBound and upperBound.\r\n\r\nBut when one flink job  has more than 1 vertex, and resource isn't enough. Some of lowerBound won't be respect.\r\nHow to reproduce this bug:\r\n\r\nOne job has 2 job vertices, we set the resource requirements are:\r\n\r\n    Vertex1: lowerBound=2, upperBound=2\r\n    Vertex2: lowerBound=8, upperBound=8\r\n\r\nThey are same slotSharingGroup, and we only 5 available slots. This job shouldn't run due to the slots cannot meets the resource requiremnt for vertex2.\r\n\r\nBut the job can runs, and the parallelism of vertex2 is 5.\r\n\r\n \r\n### Why does this  bug happen?\r\n\r\nFlink calculates the minimumRequiredSlots for each slot sharing group, it should be the max lowerBound for all vertices of current slot sharing group.\r\n\r\nBut it's using the on the minimum lowerBound.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- [FLINK-33960][JUnit5 migration] Migrate SlotSharingSlotAllocatorTest to Junit5 and Assertj\r\n- [FLINK-33960][Scheduler] Fix the bug that Adaptive Scheduler doesn't respect the lowerBound when one flink job has more than 1 tasks\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n  - Added `SlotSharingSlotAllocatorTest#testDetermineParallelismWithLowerBoundsInsufficientSlotsForPartialVertices`\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper:  no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?  no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThe patch is BP from https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/24001 for 1.17\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Marked prefix as @Nonnull and adapted assignment about prefix  \r\n- Fixed bug about methods removeKey & removeConfig\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- DelegatingConfigurationTest#testRemoveKeyOrConfig\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThe patch is BP for https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/24001\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Marked prefix as @Nonnull and adapted assignment about prefix  \r\n- Fixed bug about methods removeKey & removeConfig\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- DelegatingConfigurationTest#testRemoveKeyOrConfig\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Add restore tests for IntervalJoin node*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n  - Added restore tests for IntervalJoin node which verifies the generated compiled plan with the saved compiled plan.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThe concurrent exceptions doesn't work.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- [FLINK-33565][Exception] Archive exceptions into the exception history immediately when they occur, instead of archiving them when restarting\r\n  - The first commit is refactoring. \r\n  - Currently, archiving exception when restarting task instead of immediately. It means, when one task failure, we can see the exception history after flink restart this task. \r\n  - So the first commit is only a refactoring. It archives exceptions into the exception history immediately when they occur, instead of archiving them when restarting.\r\n- [FLINK-33565][Exception] Restart strategy checks whether current failure is a new attempt\r\n  - The second commit is related to restart strategy, adding a return value indicates whether current failure is a new attempt.\r\n- [FLINK-33565][Scheduler] ConcurrentExceptions works with exception merging\r\n  - The third commit is core solution of this JIRA:\r\n  - If it's a new attempt, it's root exception. and it will be the latest root exception.\r\n  - If it's not a new attempt, it will be a concurrentException and it will be added to the latest RootException.\r\n- [FLINK-33565][Scheduler] Correct the numberOfRestarts metric\r\n  - numberOfRestarts should be increased when exception is a new attempt\r\n- [FLINK-33565][Scheduler][refactor] Remove the wrong `@Nullable` annotation of FailureHandlingResult due to the constructor checks `verticesToRestart` is not null\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- Improve some tests of `ExecutionFailureHandlerTest`, and added new test: `testNewAttemptAndNumberOfRestarts`\r\n- Improve some old tests of `ExponentialDelayRestartBackoffTimeStrategyTest` to check whether `isNewAttempt` is expected\r\n- Improve some tests of `FailureHandlingResultTest` to test `isNewAttempt` are true and false\r\n- Improve the `DefaultSchedulerTest#testExceptionHistoryConcurrentRestart`\r\n- Check the `isNewAttempt` is expected in `FailureHandlingResultSnapshotTest`\r\n- Test `addConcurrentExceptions` in `RootExceptionHistoryEntryTest`\r\n\r\n### Test manually\r\n\r\nI added a job demo with 6 regions, all tasks will fail when processing the first record, this demo job can be run directly. Here is the result, we can see all failed tasks in the WebUI.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/flink/assets/38427477/8830b0eb-aaef-4ef6-b6dd-888f496aa229)\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Add restore tests for WatermarkAssigner node*\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - Added restore tests for WatermarkAssigner node which verifies the generated compiled plan with the saved compiled plan.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n[FLINK-33947][configuration] Fix bugs about the prefix attribute in the DelegatingConfiguration class.  \r\n\r\nIt was resulted from https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/23994#issuecomment-1869905090   \r\n\r\n-  Check and confirm other potential bug points  \r\n\r\n-  Fix the bugs about prefix key mapping when operating.  \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Marked `prefix` as `@Nonnull` and adapted assignment about `prefix`\r\n- Fixed bug about methods `removeKey` & `removeConfig`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- DelegatingConfigurationTest#testRemoveKeyOrConfig\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis pull request makes runtime-web frontend code compatible with TypeScript 5.0, which has a break change that [implicit coercions in relational operators are forbidden](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-0/#forbidden-implicit-coercions-in-relational-operators).\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nIn `runtime-web`\r\n\r\n  - Correct implicit coercions in relational operators\r\n  - otherwise, there is an incorrect way to determine NaN, and I correct it\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\n- [x] This change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently, the numRecordsIn & numBytesIn metrics for sources and the numRecordsOut & numBytesOut metrics for sinks are always 0 on the Flink web dashboard.\r\n\r\n[FLINK-11576](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-11576) brings us these metrics on the opeartor level, but it does not integrate them on the task level. On the other hand, the summay metrics on the job overview page is based on the task level I/O metrics. As a result, even though new connectors supporting FLIP-33 metrics will report operator-level I/O metrics, we still cannot see the metrics on dashboard.\r\n\r\nThis MR attempts to reuse the operator-level source/sink I/O metrics for task so that they can be viewed on Flink web dashboard. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nReuse input/output metrics of SourceOperator/SinkWriterOperator for task. \r\n\r\nSince Flink only accounts for internal traffic for input/output bytes metrics before, the reuse won't cause duplication in the I/O bytes metrics. Also, as the output records metric is intentionally dropped for SinkWriterOperator in `OperatorChain#getOperatorRecordsOutCounter` and no input records metric is collected for `SourceOperatorStreamTask`, no duplication in the I/O records metrics will take place.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nManually run Kafka2Kafka job on a testing cluster on K8s, verified that the source/sink input/output metrics can be seen on the web dashboard.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/flink/assets/22020529/4ed94730-cf21-4451-b662-de38faef87e2)\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes.

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes.

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nRemoval of extra static import\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nRemoving static import and use the qualified access\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper:  (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

IN DISCUSSION_**\r\n<!--\r\n*Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nRemove husky dependencies to ensure global hooks work as expected\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- remove dependency `husky` of `runtime-web`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\n- [x] This change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2023-12-26T07:18:32Z","updated_at":"2024-04-04T09:59:19Z","closed_at":"2024-01-04T03:40:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5f2a88e7e3ea6b5fdfbe2a0891b02431fc1010a4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273025479,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMDI1NDc5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/WebFrontend","name":"component=Runtime/WebFrontend","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23992/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23992/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/23992/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/3f87ddddd0950bae646a728bcd5b9c3e95dbda68","head":{"label":"simplejason:fix/hooks","ref":"fix/hooks","sha":"3f87ddddd0950bae646a728bcd5b9c3e95dbda68","user":{"login":"simplejason","id":11643113,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjQzMTEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11643113?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/simplejason","html_url":"https://github.com/simplejason","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simplejason/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simplejason/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simplejason/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simplejason/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simplejason/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simplejason/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simplejason/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simplejason/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simplejason/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":158804529,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTg4MDQ1Mjk=","name":"flink","full_name":"simplejason/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"simplejason","id":11643113,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjQzMTEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11643113?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/simplejason","html_url":"https://github.com/simplejason","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simplejason/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simplejason/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simplejason/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simplejason/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simplejason/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simplejason/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simplejason/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simplejason/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simplejason/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/simplejason/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nIn some exec nodes like StreamExecGroupWindowAggregate and some rules like BatchPhysicalWindowAggregateRule, planner uses \"AggregateUtil#timeFieldIndex\" to access the actual time field index, instead of using the time field index in LogicalWindow#timeAttribute directly. However, it would be more formal to use the field index instead of the column field.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Deprecate AggregateUtil#timeFieldIndex*\r\n  - *Update the code using \"AggregateUtil.timeFieldIndex(input.getRowType, call.builder(), window.timeAttribute)\" before to use  \"window.timeAttribute.getFieldIndex\"*\r\n  - *Fix the rule that doesn't update the index in window before while optimizing plan*\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAll existent tests can cover this fix.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThe initialization of CatalogStore is currently before flink-conf.yaml and StreamTableEnvironment, which causes the configuration in flink-conf.yaml to not take effect. We should move the initialization of CatalogStore after the configuration merging.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* Postponed the discovery of CatalogStoreFactory until the final configuration is merged.\r\n* Using map type options for get CatalogStore confs\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAdd unit test case in org.apache.flink.table.api.EnvironmentTest. Add CatalogStore Configuration in EnviromentSetting to verify if the discovery logic of CatalogStore can work properly, and whether other Enviroments can share the Catalog.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n[FLINK-33935][checkpoint] Improve the default value logic related to execution.checkpointing.tolerable-failed-checkpoints and state.backend.type\r\n\r\nSome state backend and checkpoint related options don't set the default value directly, but but they implement default value based on code. Such as:\r\n\r\n- execution.checkpointing.tolerable-failed-checkpoints: https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.18/docs/deployment/config/#execution-checkpointing-tolerable-failed-checkpoints\r\n- state.backend.type : https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.18/docs/deployment/config/#state-backend-type\r\n\r\n\r\n### Option1\r\n\r\nexecution.checkpointing.tolerable-failed-checkpoints doesn't have default value, but CheckpointConfig#getTolerableCheckpointFailureNumber calls  configuration.getOptional(ExecutionCheckpointingOptions.TOLERABLE_FAILURE_NUMBER).orElse(0).\r\n\r\nIt means the 0 is default value of execution.checkpointing.tolerable-failed-checkpoints.\r\n\r\n### Option2\r\n\r\nstate.backend.type does't have default value, but StateBackendLoader#loadFromApplicationOrConfigOrDefaultInternal calls \r\n\r\nloadStateBackendFromConfig(config, classLoader, logger). When the return value is null, Flink will consider the hashmap as the default state backend.\r\n\r\nI checked all callers of StateBackendLoader#loadStateBackendFromConfig, if we change the default value of state.backend.type to hashmap. All of them work well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why set the default value directly is fine?\r\n\r\n- From user side, it's clearer.\r\n- From flink developers or maintainers side, it's easy to maintain.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nAdding the default value for them:\r\n\r\n- execution.checkpointing.tolerable-failed-checkpoints: 0\r\n- state.backend.type: hashmap\r\n\r\nNote: this PR added the default value, but the behaviour is absolutely same with old one, so it doesn't introduce any effect for users.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nIn FLINK-30535, we provide benchmarks for ttl state. A customized `TtlTimeProvider` is needed for finely controlling a fixed size of expired keys per iteration. So in the `StateBackendBenchmarkUtils#createKeyedStateBackend`, a `TtlTimeProvider` should be added in parameters.\r\n\r\nAlso by the way, the `StateBackendBenchmarkUtils#prepareDirectory` is made public for the de-duplication of code in `RescalingBenchmarkBase` in state benchmarks.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- add `TtlTimeProvider` in parameters of `StateBackendBenchmarkUtils#createKeyedStateBackend`.\r\n- make `StateBackendBenchmarkUtils#prepareDirectory` public\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2023-12-21T09:37:32Z","updated_at":"2024-03-04T04:17:18Z","closed_at":"2024-01-11T03:07:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"88b1cd47fc8523aacae4ef4b1f1b7527ac43d0d5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23978/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23978/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/23978/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/6eaca639db2510b8aaa970024910dd6c3978a6b5","head":{"label":"WencongLiu:dev_1221_1704","ref":"dev_1221_1704","sha":"6eaca639db2510b8aaa970024910dd6c3978a6b5","user":{"login":"WencongLiu","id":104502720,"node_id":"U_kgDOBjqVwA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104502720?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu","html_url":"https://github.com/WencongLiu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":486167626,"node_id":"R_kgDOHPpUSg","name":"flink","full_name":"WencongLiu/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"WencongLiu","id":104502720,"node_id":"U_kgDOBjqVwA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104502720?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu","html_url":"https://github.com/WencongLiu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/WencongLiu/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix the unstable test MiniClusterITCase.testHandleStreamingJobsWhenNotEnoughSlot.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Disable the resource requirements to make sure the job failed to acquire slots until timeout.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no )\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: ( no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: ( no )\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable )\r\n","created_at":"2023-12-21T09:05:37Z","updated_at":"2024-04-04T09:59:32Z","closed_at":"2024-01-08T18:25:08Z","merged_at":"2024-01-08T18:25:08Z","merge_commit_sha":"f45de0c6de87c182a49f2a979884d3d2f66f870f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272994322,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MzIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Coordination","name":"component=Runtime/Coordination","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23977/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23977/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/23977/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/72bedb7141150bb57bfd311d3b183401c48d9128","head":{"label":"jiangxin369:FLINK-33414","ref":"FLINK-33414","sha":"72bedb7141150bb57bfd311d3b183401c48d9128","user":{"login":"jiangxin369","id":21049075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDQ5MDc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21049075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxin369","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxin369","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxin369/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxin369/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxin369/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxin369/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxin369/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxin369/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxin369/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxin369/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxin369/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":333335437,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzMzMzU0Mzc=","name":"flink","full_name":"jiangxin369/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jiangxin369","id":21049075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDQ5MDc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21049075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxin369","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxin369","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxin369/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxin369/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxin369/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxin369/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxin369/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxin369/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxin369/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxin369/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxin369/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxin369/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n[FLINK-33877][streaming] Adjusting CollectSinkFunctionTest.testConfiguredPortIsUsed's assertion message to work with JDK 17 & 21\r\n\r\nhttps://dev.azure.com/apache-flink/apache-flink/_build/results?buildId=55700&view=logs&j=675bf62c-8558-587e-2555-dcad13acefb5&t=5878eed3-cc1e-5b12-1ed0-9e7139ce0992&l=9924\r\n\r\n```\r\nDec 20 04:05:36 [Any cause is instance of class 'class java.net.BindException' and contains message 'Address already in use (Bind failed)'] \r\nDec 20 04:05:36 Expecting any element of:\r\nDec 20 04:05:36   [java.net.BindException: Address already in use\r\nDec 20 04:05:36 \tat java.base/sun.nio.ch.Net.bind0(Native Method)\r\nDec 20 04:05:36 \tat java.base/sun.nio.ch.Net.bind(Net.java:555)\r\nDec 20 04:05:36 \tat java.base/sun.nio.ch.Net.bind(Net.java:544)\r\nDec 20 04:05:36 \t...(71 remaining lines not displayed - this can be changed with Assertions.setMaxStackTraceElementsDisplayed)]\r\nDec 20 04:05:36 to satisfy the given assertions requirements but none did:\r\nDec 20 04:05:36 \r\nDec 20 04:05:36 java.net.BindException: Address already in use\r\nDec 20 04:05:36 \tat java.base/sun.nio.ch.Net.bind0(Native Method)\r\nDec 20 04:05:36 \tat java.base/sun.nio.ch.Net.bind(Net.java:555)\r\nDec 20 04:05:36 \tat java.base/sun.nio.ch.Net.bind(Net.java:544)\r\nDec 20 04:05:36 \t...(71 remaining lines not displayed - this can be changed with Assertions.setMaxStackTraceElementsDisplayed)\r\nDec 20 04:05:36 error: \r\nDec 20 04:05:36 Expecting throwable message:\r\nDec 20 04:05:36   \"Address already in use\"\r\nDec 20 04:05:36 to contain:\r\nDec 20 04:05:36   \"Address already in use (Bind failed)\"\r\nDec 20 04:05:36 but did not.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests\r\n\r\n```\r\njdk21\r\ncd flink-streaming-java\r\nmvn test -Dtest=org.apache.flink.streaming.api.operators.collect.CollectSinkFunctionTest\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis introduces `AsyncScalarFunction` a new UDF type which allows asynchronous responses.  The functionality here is covered in FLIP-400: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/FLIP-400%3A+AsyncScalarFunction+for+asynchronous+scalar+function+support\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  It changes it only for new uses of the AsyncScalarFunction, not existing code paths.\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (**yes** / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / **JavaDocs** / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2023-12-21T00:10:32Z","updated_at":"2024-04-04T09:59:34Z","closed_at":"2024-01-15T14:41:41Z","merged_at":"2024-01-15T14:41:41Z","merge_commit_sha":"b666de974b5dbc6e0d6710baececb1d6ede9b769","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272993074,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTkzMDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=%3Cnone%3E","name":"component=<none>","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23975/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23975/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/23975/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/61da4086c217b69531be6599233108654ea61282","head":{"label":"AlanConfluent:async_scalar_function","ref":"async_scalar_function","sha":"61da4086c217b69531be6599233108654ea61282","user":{"login":"AlanConfluent","id":57688982,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Njg4OTgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57688982?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent","html_url":"https://github.com/AlanConfluent","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":572267320,"node_id":"R_kgDOIhwbOA","name":"flink","full_name":"AlanConfluent/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlanConfluent","id":57688982,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Njg4OTgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57688982?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent","html_url":"https://github.com/AlanConfluent","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlanConfluent/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlanConfluent/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n[FLINK-32850][flink-runtime][JUnit5 Migration] \r\n\r\n- The io.network.partition package of flink-runtime module\r\n- The remaining tests in the io.network package of flink-runtime module\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2023-12-20T15:38:53Z","updated_at":"2024-04-04T09:59:35Z","closed_at":"2023-12-22T03:13:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f5ce53b79f9f0a950f6a83a1081123c5b07ac590","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273164140,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMTY0MTQw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Tests","name":"component=Tests","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23974/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23974/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/23974/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/6aa8906d112ee7e9ceb155e5f1a4f4509de51aca","head":{"label":"Jiabao-Sun:junit5-io-network-partition","ref":"junit5-io-network-partition","sha":"6aa8906d112ee7e9ceb155e5f1a4f4509de51aca","user":{"login":"Jiabao-Sun","id":27403841,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NDAzODQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27403841?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun","html_url":"https://github.com/Jiabao-Sun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":362033666,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNjIwMzM2NjY=","name":"flink","full_name":"Jiabao-Sun/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Jiabao-Sun","id":27403841,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NDAzODQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27403841?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun","html_url":"https://github.com/Jiabao-Sun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Jiabao-Sun/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n[runtime][JUnit5 Migration] The resourcemanager package of flink-runtime module\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n[runtime][JUnit5 Migration] The resourcemanager package of flink-runtime module\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (**not applicable** / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2023-12-20T15:17:05Z","updated_at":"2024-04-04T09:59:36Z","closed_at":"2023-12-26T14:44:51Z","merged_at":"2023-12-26T14:44:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"11cdf7e7adacfe64d961a48844841a24b918257a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273164140,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMTY0MTQw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Tests","name":"component=Tests","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23973/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23973/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/23973/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/6b47b5e32620f832e9647e59a1351919b4559891","head":{"label":"RocMarshal:FLINK-32849_runtime_rm","ref":"FLINK-32849_runtime_rm","sha":"6b47b5e32620f832e9647e59a1351919b4559891","user":{"login":"RocMarshal","id":64569824,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NTY5ODI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64569824?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal","html_url":"https://github.com/RocMarshal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":260947074,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjA5NDcwNzQ=","name":"flink","full_name":"RocMarshal/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"RocMarshal","id":64569824,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NTY5ODI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64569824?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal","html_url":"https://github.com/RocMarshal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RocMarshal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/RocMarshal/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nSingleJobGraphStore was introduced a long time ago in FLIP-6. It is only used in a test case in DefaultDispatcherRunnerITCase#\r\nleaderChange_withBlockingJobManagerTermination_doesNotAffectNewLeader. We can replace it with TestingJobGraphStore there and then safely remove the class. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nRemove the obsolete SingleJobGraphStore.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR is to avoid the potential hang of Hybrid Shuffle during redistribution. The details about how a hang happens, please see [issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-33879).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Adds an interface `ensureCapacity` to TieredStorageMemoryManager to help reserve enough buffers.\r\n  - Adds a variable `definitelyRecycled` to indicate that the buffers of a tier can be definitely recycled even if there are no readers.\r\n  - Reserves buffers every time a non-definitelyRecycled tier receives a buffer.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - Added test that validates that the ResultPartition would not hang even if most buffers are occupied by the memory tier and redistribution happens.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Add restore tests for WindowRank node*\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n- Added restore tests for WindowRank node which verifies the generated compiled plan with the saved compiled plan\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n[FLINK-33877][streaming] Fix unstable test of CollectSinkFunctionTest.testConfiguredPortIsUsed\r\n\r\nhttps://dev.azure.com/apache-flink/apache-flink/_build/results?buildId=55646&view=logs&j=0da23115-68bb-5dcd-192c-bd4c8adebde1&t=24c3384f-1bcb-57b3-224f-51bf973bbee8&l=9482\r\n```\r\nDec 18 17:49:57 17:49:57.241 [ERROR] org.apache.flink.streaming.api.operators.collect.CollectSinkFunctionTest.testConfiguredPortIsUsed -- Time elapsed: 0.021 s <<< ERROR!\r\nDec 18 17:49:57 java.net.BindException: Address already in use (Bind failed)\r\nDec 18 17:49:57 \tat java.net.PlainSocketImpl.socketBind(Native Method)\r\nDec 18 17:49:57 \tat java.net.AbstractPlainSocketImpl.bind(AbstractPlainSocketImpl.java:387)\r\nDec 18 17:49:57 \tat java.net.ServerSocket.bind(ServerSocket.java:390)\r\nDec 18 17:49:57 \tat java.net.ServerSocket.<init>(ServerSocket.java:252)\r\nDec 18 17:49:57 \tat org.apache.flink.streaming.api.operators.collect.CollectSinkFunction$ServerThread.<init>(CollectSinkFunction.java:375)\r\nDec 18 17:49:57 \tat org.apache.flink.streaming.api.operators.collect.CollectSinkFunction$ServerThread.<init>(CollectSinkFunction.java:362)\r\nDec 18 17:49:57 \tat org.apache.flink.streaming.api.operators.collect.CollectSinkFunction.open(CollectSinkFunction.java:252)\r\nDec 18 17:49:57 \tat org.apache.flink.streaming.api.operators.collect.utils.CollectSinkFunctionTestWrapper.openFunction(CollectSinkFunctionTestWrapper.java:103)\r\nDec 18 17:49:57 \tat org.apache.flink.streaming.api.operators.collect.CollectSinkFunctionTest.testConfiguredPortIsUsed(CollectSinkFunctionTest.java:138)\r\nDec 18 17:49:57 \tat java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:498)\r\nDec 18 17:49:57 \tat java.util.concurrent.RecursiveAction.exec(RecursiveAction.java:189)\r\nDec 18 17:49:57 \tat java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinTask.doExec(ForkJoinTask.java:289)\r\nDec 18 17:49:57 \tat java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinPool$WorkQueue.runTask(ForkJoinPool.java:1056)\r\nDec 18 17:49:57 \tat java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinPool.runWorker(ForkJoinPool.java:1692)\r\nDec 18 17:49:57 \tat java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinWorkerThread.run(ForkJoinWorkerThread.java:175)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nBased on the exception stack trace, it is possible that port 50500 is being used by other test cases. \r\nTo make this test more stable, we may need to use a random port.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis pull request supports configuring the PARALLELISM_OVERRIDES configuration during the job submission process. Before this PR, Flink has currently only allowed configuring this parameter before the Dispatcher, or the cluster, starts.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Pass PARALLELISM_OVERRIDES from environment to job graph.\r\n- Make dispatcher use PARALLELISM_OVERRIDES from job graph before submitting job.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is covered by modified and newly added tests in JarRunHandlerParameterTest and DispatcherTest.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: yes\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? not applicable\r\n","created_at":"2023-12-19T01:50:16Z","updated_at":"2024-04-04T09:59:55Z","closed_at":"2023-12-20T03:54:00Z","merged_at":"2023-12-20T03:54:00Z","merge_commit_sha":"6aa64ebb88045abef8b900b1ff3e15b171da5709","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273025819,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMDI1ODE5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Configuration","name":"component=Runtime/Configuration","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273465073,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczNDY1MDcz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/REST","name":"component=Runtime/REST","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23953/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23953/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/23953/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/0165b2d94c1464a19c1b74f77e2fbaa1e5e236eb","head":{"label":"yunfengzhou-hub:FLINK-33534-1.18","ref":"FLINK-33534-1.18","sha":"0165b2d94c1464a19c1b74f77e2fbaa1e5e236eb","user":{"login":"yunfengzhou-hub","id":54601269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NjAxMjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54601269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub","html_url":"https://github.com/yunfengzhou-hub","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":360814046,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNjA4MTQwNDY=","name":"flink","full_name":"yunfengzhou-hub/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yunfengzhou-hub","id":54601269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NjAxMjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54601269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub","html_url":"https://github.com/yunfengzhou-hub","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yunfengzhou-hub/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n[FLINK-33876][table-planner][JUnit5 Migration] Introduce methodName method in TableTestBase\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nAfter completing the JUnit5 migration in the table planner, there is an incompatibility issue with JUnit TestName and TestInfo. Therefore, considering introducing the methodName method in TableTestBase. External connectors's TablePlanTest can override this method when performing JUnit 5 migration for TableTestBase to avoid compilation issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2023-12-18T16:04:03Z","updated_at":"2024-04-04T09:59:57Z","closed_at":"2023-12-19T11:16:40Z","merged_at":"2023-12-19T11:16:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"945c5062c28c3feee94703e88fe6ef797e3760b3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273164140,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMTY0MTQw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Tests","name":"component=Tests","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1285080206,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjg1MDgwMjA2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/Planner","name":"component=TableSQL/Planner","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23952/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23952/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/23952/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/85c84e98f1c1c483972dbe30b4e30ca127817360","head":{"label":"Jiabao-Sun:FLINK-33876","ref":"FLINK-33876","sha":"85c84e98f1c1c483972dbe30b4e30ca127817360","user":{"login":"Jiabao-Sun","id":27403841,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NDAzODQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27403841?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun","html_url":"https://github.com/Jiabao-Sun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":362033666,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNjIwMzM2NjY=","name":"flink","full_name":"Jiabao-Sun/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Jiabao-Sun","id":27403841,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NDAzODQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27403841?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun","html_url":"https://github.com/Jiabao-Sun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jiabao-Sun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Jiabao-Sun/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n* We fix the bug where checkpoint history does not show for completed jobs.\r\n\r\nBackport of https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/23949\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n* If job is not found when retrieving checkpoint stats snapshot, we first check the execution graph store, before throwing exception.\r\n* Add unit tests for:\r\n   * Retrieving checkpoint statistics for completed job\r\n   * Retrieving checkpoint statistics for non-existent job (verify exception is thrown)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n- Added unit test to verify checkpoint statistics can be retrieved for FAILED job.\r\n- Added unit test to verify non-existent job still throws `FlinkJobNotFoundException`\r\n- Manually verified by spinning up local cluster.\r\n\r\nRunning job with checkpoint details:\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/flink/assets/35062175/f7d46864-fdfb-4f6f-a371-dea5b3580368)\r\n\r\nCancelled job with checkpoint

What is the purpose of the change\r\n* We fix the bug where checkpoint history does not show for completed jobs.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n* If job is not found when retrieving checkpoint stats

statistics for non-existent job (verify exception is thrown)\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n- Added unit test to verify checkpoint statistics can be retrieved for FAILED job.\r\n- Added unit test to verify non-existent job still throws `FlinkJobNotFoundException`\r\n- Manually verified by spinning up local cluster.\r\n\r\nRunning

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis pull request updates `AsyncSinkThrottlingTest` to use concurrent `TestSinkInitContextAnyThreadMailbox` due the concurrent nature of the test and to address CI stability issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n- Updated  `AsyncSinkThrottlingTest` to use concurrent `TestSinkInitContextAnyThreadMailbox`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework for test suite, changes are verified by rerunning tests in debug mode.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive):no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? not applicable

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nHiveCatalog.getHiveTable method wastes a lot of time when generate graph, because the number of calls  is relatively high.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have an sql task with over 2000 rows,  the HiveCatalog.getHiveTable  method is called 4879 times , but only six hive tables were used. \r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/flink/assets/18002496/d5f0daf3-f80a-4790-ae21-4e75dff9cfd7)\r\n\r\nThe client.getTable method costs a lot of time.

call takes approximately 50 milliseconds ,\r\nHow much time it spends  : 4879 * 50 =243950ms  = 243.95s  = 4min\r\n\r\nWe can cache and  client.getTable method  is only  called six times.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nReduce getTable call for hive client by using cache.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis pull request supports configuring the PARALLELISM_OVERRIDES configuration during the job submission process. Before this PR, Flink has currently only allowed configuring this parameter before the Dispatcher, or the cluster, starts.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Pass PARALLELISM_OVERRIDES from environment to job graph.\r\n- Make dispatcher use PARALLELISM_OVERRIDES from job graph before submitting job.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is covered by modified and newly added tests in JarRunHandlerParameterTest and DispatcherTest.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: yes\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? not applicable\r\n","created_at":"2023-12-18T05:35:29Z","updated_at":"2024-04-04T10:00:05Z","closed_at":"2023-12-19T01:23:58Z","merged_at":"2023-12-19T01:23:58Z","merge_commit_sha":"4cc24c1dd17b0abe3c4372652c7ab88fedc7e478","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273025819,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMDI1ODE5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Configuration","name":"component=Runtime/Configuration","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273465073,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczNDY1MDcz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/REST","name":"component=Runtime/REST","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23944/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23944/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/23944/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/5c44f53d385b79259e1715721873cdce6fb24416","head":{"label":"yunfengzhou-hub:FLINK-33534","ref":"FLINK-33534","sha":"5c44f53d385b79259e1715721873cdce6fb24416","user":{"login":"yunfengzhou-hub","id":54601269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NjAxMjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54601269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub","html_url":"https://github.com/yunfengzhou-hub","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":360814046,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNjA4MTQwNDY=","name":"flink","full_name":"yunfengzhou-hub/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yunfengzhou-hub","id":54601269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NjAxMjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54601269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub","html_url":"https://github.com/yunfengzhou-hub","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yunfengzhou-hub/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Support CharType for the MaxAggFunction.**\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* Support CharType for the MaxAggFunction like  MinAggFunction*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n* original unit test *\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no )\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no )\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

content.zh/docs/dev/table/overview.md\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes.

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n**Background**\r\n\r\nFlink serializes and deserializes protobuf format data by calling the decode or encode method in GeneratedProtoToRow_XXX.java generated by codegen to parse byte[] data into Protobuf Java objects. [FLINK-32650](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-32650) has introduced the ability to split the generated code to improve the performance for large Protobuf schemas. However, this is still not sufficient to support some larger protobuf schemas as the generated code exceeds the java constant pool size [limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_class_file#The_constant_pool) and we can see errors like \"Too many constants\" when trying to compile the generated code. We have run into these issues while doing a POC with some of our real production schemas at UBER\r\n\r\n**Solution**\r\n\r\nSplit the last code segment also only when the size exceeds split threshold limit. Currently, the last segment of the generated code is always being split which can lead to too many split methods and thus exceed the constant pool size limit\r\n\r\n**Implementation**\r\n\r\nAdd check for split size before splitting last segment\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n\r\n-     [FLINK-33611] [flink-protobuf] Add VeryBigProtobuf testcases\r\n-     [FLINK-33611] [flink-protobuf] Split last segment only when size exceeds split threshold limit in serializer\r\n-     [FLINK-33611] [flink-protobuf] Split last segment only when size exceeds split threshold limit in deserializer\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as existing Unit Tests and Integration tests for Protobuf format Including the `BigProtoBufCodeSpiltterTest`. Additionally, I have added a new test with very big protobuf schemas which would fail without the optimizations made in this pull request\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): No\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: No\r\n  - The serializers: No\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): No\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: No\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: No\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? Yes\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? Not Applicable as the feature is fully transparent to

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Add restore tests for WindowTableFunction node*\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n- Added restore tests for WindowTableFunction node which verifies the generated compiled plan with the saved compiled plan\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable)\r\n","created_at":"2023-12-15T21:19:14Z","updated_at":"2024-04-04T10:00:11Z","closed_at":"2023-12-20T15:46:15Z","merged_at":"2023-12-20T15:46:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"cabb28d25c4c58af3ee23fc4a63f9564aefd6146","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"dawidwys","id":6242259,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNDIyNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6242259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys","html_url":"https://github.com/dawidwys","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1285080206,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjg1MDgwMjA2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/Planner","name":"component=TableSQL/Planner","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23936/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/23936/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/23936/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/1b8f6bc6cab9126c247103f2ddcc5c3a1682d9bb","head":{"label":"bvarghese1:window_tvf_restore_tests","ref":"window_tvf_restore_tests","sha":"1b8f6bc6cab9126c247103f2ddcc5c3a1682d9bb","user":{"login":"bvarghese1","id":10199670,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTk5Njcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10199670?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1","html_url":"https://github.com/bvarghese1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":639592192,"node_id":"R_kgDOJh9nAA","name":"flink","full_name":"bvarghese1/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bvarghese1","id":10199670,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTk5Njcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10199670?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1","html_url":"https://github.com/bvarghese1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvarghese1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bvarghese1/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n[FLINK-33853][runtime][JUnit5 Migration] Migrate Junit5 for DeclarativeSlotPoolBridge test classes of runtime module\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- DeclarativeSlotPoolBridgeRequestCompletionTest\r\n- DeclarativeSlotPoolBridgeResourceDeclarationTest\r\n- DeclarativeSlotPoolBridgePreferredAllocationsTest\r\n- DeclarativeSlotPoolBridgeTest\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nN.A\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix NullArgumentException of getQuantile method in DescriptiveStatisticsHistogramStatistics\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nThis DescriptiveStatisticsHistogramStatistics class has added null initialization\r\n1、DescriptiveStatisticsHistogramStatistics.java\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n<img width=\"845\" alt=\"3799e5aae7fa3cc0500aa1cd0b06856\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/flink/assets/28818582/f498c368-0766-4cb1-adff-bb77abf5cda9\">\r\n\r\nDuring the verification process, the task was submitted to Yarn and run in Yarn cluster mode. After multiple stops and restarts, it was found that the NullArgumentException exception had disappeared. This fully verified the correctness of the modification, improved the stability of program operation, and also improved the accuracy of displaying statistical information in the web UI interface of the Flink task (as shown in the above figure).\r\nThe highlighted log section in the above figure is the log I printed to assist in troubleshooting, which can be ignored.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAt the moment Flink is throwing exception on unknown fields when parsing REST responses. An example for such a class is `JobDetailsInfo` but this applies to all others. In this PR we ignore all unknown fields in case of REST response JSON deserialization.\r\n\r\nThis is implemented based on
