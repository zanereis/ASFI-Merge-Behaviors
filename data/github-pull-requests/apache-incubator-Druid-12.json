Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

For example: -->\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces functionality to prevent unnecessary task creation and associated costs when record parsing exceptions exceed the `maxAllowedParseExceptions` threshold. Currently, when this threshold is reached, the streaming ingestion task fails, and subsequent tasks continue to fail. This cycle persists until the Supervisor specification is updated to handle the problematic data or until the `maxAllowedParseExceptions` setting is increased.\r\n\r\nWith the changes introduced in this PR, if the `maxAllowedParseExceptions` limit is violated, the Supervisor will now halt the creation of new tasks. This prevents the initiation of tasks that are likely to fail due to the same parsing issues, thereby reducing unnecessary resource consumption and cost implications.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects.

#12926.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis PR improves the test cases in `DecimalParquetInputTest` by replacing the if-return blocks that check for unsupported parser types with `assumeFalse`-- Assume API from Junit. \r\n\r\n#### Replaced if-return blocks with assumeFalse\r\nThe existing test cases used if-return blocks like this to skip tests for unsupported parser types:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n// parquet-avro does not correctly convert decimal types\r\nif (parserType.equals(ParquetExtensionsModule.PARQUET_AVRO_INPUT_PARSER_TYPE)) {  \r\n  return;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis made the test logic implicit. It's preferable to make unsupported preconditions explicit using JUnit's `assume` methods. The assume function, introduced after JUnit 4, is designed to check for test pre-condition. As [mentioned in the document](https://junit.org/junit4/javadoc/4.12/org/junit/Assume.html):\r\n\r\n> Assume functions is a set of methods useful for stating assumptions about the conditions in which a test is meaningful. A failed assumption does not mean the code is broken, but that the test provides no useful information.\r\n\r\nI replaced the if-return blocks with equivalent `assumeFalse` assertions:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n// parquet-avro does not correctly convert decimal types\r\nassumeFalse(parserType.equals(ParquetExtensionsModule.PARQUET_AVRO_INPUT_PARSER_TYPE));\r\n```\r\n\r\nA failed assumption will cause the test to be skipped, while still allowing the test to run for supported parser types. This makes the preconditions clearer without changing the test behavior.\r\n\r\n**This refactoring resolves the silent quit issue by using the Assume API to provide explicit output when tests are skipped.**\r\n\r\nI applied this change to all three test cases in `DecimalParquetInputTest`:\r\n- `testReadParquetDecimalFixedLen` \r\n- `testReadParquetDecimali32`\r\n- `testReadParquetDecimali64`\r\n\r\nThis is a straightforward refactoring that improves test readability without altering functionality. No other code changes were made.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be!

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `.gitignore`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\nThe current model of tracking task counts for the `TaskCountStatsMonitor` is too limiting and verbose.\r\n- It requires a different method for each type of task count - running, waiting, pending, etc.\r\n- It makes adding new dimensions and metrics cumbersome as can be seen in the PR #16403 \r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- Remove deprecated methods from `TaskCountStatsProvider`\r\n- Rename `CoordinatorRunStats` to `DruidRunStats` as it is now being extensively used outside the coordinator.\r\n- Simplify collection of stats in `TaskQueue`.\r\n  - Remove methods `getRunningTaskCount`, `getWaitingTaskCount`, etc.\r\n  - Collect all stats in a single `DruidRunStats` instance which is reset upon invocation of `getQueueStats()` \r\n- Add dimension `taskType` to task count metrics\r\n\r\n### Classes to review\r\n- `TaskQueue`\r\n- `TaskCountStatsProvider`\r\n- `TaskCountStatsMonitor`\r\n- `TaskMaster`\r\n\r\n### Further work\r\n- There are several other count stats providers which may benefit from a similar cleanup. I will try to consolidate all of them in a follow up PR.\r\n\r\n### Design considerations\r\nThe few advantages of the previous design were that:\r\n- The metrics emitted by the monitor were clearly listed out in the monitor itself. This can still be retained by adding logic in the monitor to filter out the metrics contained in the `DruidRunStats`.\r\n- The individual methods in the interface made it necessary for the concrete implementation to provide those metrics. But with a plain `getStats()` method which returns a packaged `DruidRunStats`, it is possible for the concrete implementation to return any or no metrics inside the `DruidRunStats`. Still thinking of a clean way to enforce this. I suppose we could add logic in the monitor to ensure that all required metrics have been sent by the implementation.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR updates CompactionTask to not load any lookups by default, unless `transformSpec` is present.\r\n\r\nIf transformSpec is present, we will make the decision based on context values, loading all lookups by default. This is done to ensure backward compatibility since transformSpec can reference lookups.\r\nIf transform spec is not present and no context value is passed, we donot load any lookup.\r\n\r\nThis behavior can be overridden by supplying `lookupLoadingMode` and `lookupsToLoad` in the task context.\r\n\r\nOther changes/refactoring:\r\n1. Moved CTX_LOOKUP_LOADING_MODE and CTX_LOOKUPS_TO_LOAD constants from PlannerContext to LookupLoadingSpec, as PlannerContext wasn't available in the indexing module.\r\n2. Moved logic for evaluating the context and creating LookupLoadingSpec based on that to `LookupLoadingSpec#getSpecFromContext`.\r\n3. Updated `Task#getLookupLoadingSpec` to return `LookupLoadingSpec.getSpecFromContext(getContext(), LookupLoadingSpec.ALL)`. The default `ALL` ensures that no existing behavior is broken, unless context has been overridden. Making this change in `Task` interface prevents us from having to make this change in a bunch of tasks that are spawned by CompactionTask.\r\n\r\n## Test Plan\r\n\r\n1. Tried manual compaction with all 3 partitioning modes (dynamic, range, hash) - validated that no lookups are loaded in the compaction task, as well as all the other spawned tasks.\r\n2. Repeated (1) with overriding task context with combination of `lookupLoadingMode` and `lookupsToLoad` - validated that the lookups in all tasks (compaction + spawned) were loaded as per the overridden context. This would help achieve any use-cases where lookups are needed during compaction.\r\n3. Validated that auto-compaction also doesn't load any lookups by default.\r\n4. Also tried ingestion in all 3 partitioning modes (dynamic, range, hash) to ensure this behavior is unaffected.\r\n5. Validated different types of MSQ queries and ingestion to make sure their behavior is unaffected.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

If current WorkerSelectStrategy is category based strategy(FillCapacityWithCategorySpecWorkerSelectStrategy and EqualDistributionWithCategorySpecWorkerSelectStrategy),  we will calculate the capacity group by category in getWorkerCategoryCapacity method.\r\n2. if current WorkerSelectStrategy is not category based strategy, the getWorkerCategoryCapacity will return null.\r\n3. In OverlordResource#getTotalWorkerCapacity method, get the capacity group by category from WorkerSelectStrategy#getWorkerCategoryCapacity\r\n4. In CoordinatorDutyUtils#getTotalWorkerCapacity if overlordClient.getTotalWorkerCapacity() return category based capacity, return  Math.min(totalCapacity, (int) (totalWorkerCapacity * taskSlotRatio)); here totalCapacity is category capacity.\r\nSummary: according to the WorkerSelectStrategy(category based or not), set the category capacity in TotalWorkerCapacityResponse, in client side, compare the category capacity and totalWorkerCapacity * taskSlotRatio, take the smaller one\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Fixed the bug 15847\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n##### Fix the bug of getCompactionTaskCapacity which is not category aware\r\n##### Update the getTotalWorkerCapacity of OverlordResource\r\nif WorkerSelectStrategy is category based strategy(FillCapacityWithCategorySpecWorkerSelectStrategy and EqualDistributionWithCategorySpecWorkerSelectStrategy),  TotalWorkerCapacityResponse will contains the capacity group by category.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `CategoryCapacityInfo`\r\n * `OverlordResource`\r\n * `TotalWorkerCapacityResponse`\r\n * `EqualDistributionWithCategorySpecWorkerSelectStrategy`\r\n * `FillCapacityWithCategorySpecWorkerSelectStrategy`\r\n * `WorkerSelectStrategy`\r\n * `WorkerSelectUtils`\r\n * `OverlordResourceTest`\r\n * `EqualDistributionWithCategorySpecWorkerSelectStrategyTest`\r\n * `FillCapacityWithCategorySpecWorkerSelectStrategyTest`\r\n * `IndexingCategoryCapacityInfo`\r\n * `IndexingTotalWorkerCapacityInfo`\r\n * `IndexingWorker`\r\n * `CompactSegments`\r\n * `CoordinatorDutyUtils`\r\n * `KillUnusedSegments`\r\n * `OverlordClientImplTest`\r\n * `CompactSegmentsTest`\r\n * `KillUnusedSegmentsTest`\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

validation for reindex with realtime sources.\r\n\r\nWith the addition of concurrent compaction, it is possible to ingest data while querying from realtime sources with MSQ into the same datasource. This could potentially lead to issues if the interval that is ingested into is replaced by an MSQ job, which has queried only some of the data from the realtime task. \r\n\r\nThis PR adds validation to check that the datasource being ingested into is not being queried from, if the query includes realtime sources.\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

changes:\r\n\r\n1) DruidSqlValidator now includes a rewrite of IN to SCALAR_IN_ARRAY, when the size of\r\n   the IN is above inFunctionThreshold. The default value of inFunctionThreshold\r\n   is 100. Users can restore the prior behavior by setting it to Integer.MAX_VALUE.\r\n\r\n2) SearchOperatorConversion now generates SCALAR_IN_ARRAY when converting to a regular\r\n   expression, when the size of the SEARCH is above inFunctionExprThreshold. The default\r\n   value of inFunctionExprThreshold is 2. Users can restore the prior behavior by setting\r\n   it to Integer.MAX_VALUE.\r\n\r\n3) ReverseLookupRule generates SCALAR_IN_ARRAY if the set of reverse-looked-up values is\r\n   greater than inFunctionThreshold.\r\n\r\nBenchmarks follow. Overall planning for large `IN` is much faster. Two new ones are marked with `DNF` on `master`, where I gave up and canceled them after they ran for a few minutes. Those same test cases completed in 100ms each with the patch.\r\n\r\n```\r\nInPlanningBenchmark\r\n===================\r\n\r\ninClauseLiteralsCount = 1000\r\ninSubQueryThreshold =

a bug with exporting results with MSQ.\r\n\r\nMSQ uses StorageConnectors to connect to external locations and write results during the export stage. However, certain implementations of storage connectors overwrite the older version of the file at the same path. This can result in files being overwritten during a single export query, ultimately causing missing results.\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to resolve this by maintaining a connection with the destination.\r\n\r\nTesting with the PR locally, files do not get overwritten.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Bug\r\n\r\nConsider a situation where there are:\r\n1) No used segments\r\n2) Unused segments with ids ranging from 1 to 10\r\n3) Pending segments with ids ranging from 1 to 5 due to partial clean up\r\n\r\nPreviously, new segment allocations would consider only used and pending segments and allocate a segment with id 6.\r\nThis is problematic as it conflicts with an existing unused entry in the segments table.\r\n\r\n### Cause\r\n\r\nThe bug was discovered because of the pending segment cleanup introduced recently as part of https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/16144. \r\nThis PR introduced pending segment clean up but it is partial as it cleans pending segments created only after the overlord's upgrade.\r\nSequence of events:\r\n1) Allocate and commit segments with ids from 1 to 5 \r\n2) Checkout to a commit containing the above PR\r\n3) Allocate and commit segments with ids from 6 to 10. The pending segments would be cleaned up upon completion.\r\n4) Mark all segments from 1 - 10 as unused.\r\n5) Allocate a new segment.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\nAfter a segment has been allocated, check that it doesn't correspond to any used or unused segment id in druid_segments table.\r\nIf it does, try to look at the unused segments and increment the partitionNum to max(unusedSegment.partitionNum) + 1 if needed.\r\nEven though this requires fetching all unused segments for a given (datasource, version, interval) when there is a conflict, the conflict would arise due to unused segments at most once and would not affect batch segment allocation's performance.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Alternatives\r\nUnused pending segments must be cleaned up or ignored when they are not associated with any existing active lock.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid

Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, `DruidViewMacro` was using `Collections.emptyMap()`, that is, an immutable map for creating the DruidPlanner. This doesn't sit well with the contract of `PlannerContext#queryContextMap` which is expected to return a mutable map.\r\n\r\nCurrently, if anyone were to rely on getting a mutable map as per the contract, it can run into issues in code flows where the planner is being created using immutable map. For example, 500+ tests failed because of adding [this line](https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/16358/files#diff-630eb92856c1b8dd3034980b486124e31952c8eef0a9195bbacb9bbe310a3023R84) since I assumed the return type must be mutable.\r\n\r\nThis PR shifts away from the immutable map for creating planner to ensure everyone can rely on the returned map being mutable without breaking any code flows. With this PR, the planner's constructor creates a mutable map even if an immutable map was passed to it.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\nThis PR fixes up a deadlock that was introduced by https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/15420.\r\n\r\nConsider the following sequence of calls:\r\n\r\n| Time | Thread1 | Thread2 |\r\n|--------|--------|--------|\r\n| 1 | pool.reserve(query1) | |\r\n| 2 | | pool.reserve(query2) |\r\n| 3 | pool.clean(query1) | |\r\n\r\nAssuming that the pool has enough merge buffers to allow each query to proceed individually, but not together, the following will happen (in the original code). The `clean(at t=3, by thread1)` would be blocked on the `reserve(at t=2, by thread2)` to complete. However, the reserve won't succeed since it doesn't have enough merge buffers, and is waiting on the clean call, hence the cyclic dependency. (**NOTE**: This also assumes that the resourceId of query1 and query2 would hold the lock on the same entry in the concurrent hash map).\r\n\r\nThe fix is to reserve the buffer before acquiring a lock on the concurrent hash map and hold the locks for the minimal time possible. This way, other calls like `remove()` and `fetch()` are not blocked on the actual acquisition of the merge buffers to succeed. \r\n\r\nI have added a test case to replicate the sequence of events. The test case fails before the patch, however succeeds after the patch. The test case isn't perfect, however, given the blocking nature of the reserve() call, I couldn't find an alternative. \r\n\r\n\r\nThanks @weishiuntsai and  @gianm  for identifying and debugging the test case. \r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test Druid

patch adds `FallbackVectorProcessor`, a processor that adapts non-vectorizable operations into vectorizable ones. It is used in `FunctionExpr` and `BaseMacroFunctionExpr`. As a result, all such expressions can now participate in vectorized queries.\r\n\r\nIn addition:\r\n\r\n- Identifiers are updated to offer getObjectVector for ARRAY and COMPLEX in addition to STRING. ExprEvalObjectVector is updated to offer ARRAY and COMPLEX as well. Identifiers already did `return true` from `canVectorize`, so this enables them to live up to their claims.\r\n\r\n- In SQL tests, cannotVectorize now fails tests if an exception is not thrown. This makes it easier to identify tests that can now vectorize.\r\n\r\n- Fixes a null-matcher bug in StringObjectVectorValueMatcher that was uncovered by certain newly-vectorizable test cases.\r\n\r\nBenchmarks follow for `SqlExpressionBenchmark` queries 26 and 27. These two queries are:\r\n\r\n```\r\n-- 26: group by string expr with non-expr agg\r\nSELECT CONCAT(string2, '-', long2), SUM(double1) FROM foo GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 2\r\n\r\n-- 27: group by string expr with expr agg\r\nSELECT CONCAT(string2, '-', long2), SUM(long1 * double4) FROM foo GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 2\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn these cases fallback vectorization is not as compelling as proper vectorization, but it's better than unvectorized execution. The relative benefit is greater for query 27, likely because fallback vectorization for `CONCAT` enables the `long1 * double4` to vectorize as well. In general I would expect the benefit to be greater for more complex queries, due to this effect.\r\n\r\n```\r\nBenchmark                        (query)  (rowsPerSegment)  (schema)  (vectorize)  Mode

href=\"https://github.com/scala/scala/releases\">org.scala-lang:scala-library's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Scala 2.13.13</h2>\n<p>The Scala team at Lightbend is pleased to announce Scala 2.13.13.</p>\n<p>The following changes are highlights of this release:</p>\n<h3>Language</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Support binary integer literals using <code>0b</code>, as in Java (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/scala/scala/pull/10656\">#10656</a> by <a href=\"https://github.com/som-snytt\"><code>@​som-snytt</code></a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Compatibility</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>TASTy reader: support Scala 3.4 (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/scala/scala/pull/10670\">#10670</a> by <a href=\"https://github.com/bishabosha\"><code>@​bishabosha</code></a>)</li>\n<li>Support certain Java libraries compiled on JDK 21 (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/scala/scala/pull/10675\">#10675</a> by <a href=\"https://github.com/SethTisue\"><code>@​SethTisue</code></a>)</li>\n<li>For JDK 22 support, upgrade to ASM 9.6 (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/scala/scala/pull/10576\">#10576</a> by <a href=\"https://github.com/Philippus\"><code>@​Philippus</code></a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Align with Scala 3</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Allow either <code>-Xsource:3</code> (for preparing to switch to 3) or <code>-Xsource:3-cross</code> (for crossbuilding on 2 and 3); some existing users of <code>-Xsource:3</code> should switch to <code>-Xsource:3-cross</code> to avoid unwanted behavior changes (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/scala/scala/pull/10573\">#10573</a> by <a href=\"https://github.com/som-snytt\"><code>@​som-snytt</code></a>)\n<ul>\n<li>A new section in the Scala 3 Migration Guide documents <code>-Xsource:3</code> and <code>-Xsource:3-cross</code>: <a href=\"https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/guides/migration/tooling-scala2-xsource3.html\">documentation</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>For migration to 3, accommodate case companion as function (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/scala/scala/pull/10648\">#10648</a> by <a href=\"https://github.com/som-snytt\"><code>@​som-snytt</code></a>)</li>\n<li>Scala 3 migration warning for implicits found in package prefix (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/scala/scala/pull/10621\">#10621</a> by <a href=\"https://github.com/lrytz\"><code>@​lrytz</code></a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Other improvements</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><code>-Yrelease</code> supplements <code>-release</code>, allows access to additional JVM packages (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/scala/scala/pull/10543\">#10543</a> by <a href=\"https://github.com/som-snytt\"><code>@​som-snytt</code></a>)</li>\n<li><code>-Xlint</code> now enables <code>-Xlint:named-booleans</code> to lint unnamed boolean literal args (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/scala/scala/pull/10612\">#10612</a> by <a href=\"https://github.com/som-snytt\"><code>@​som-snytt</code></a>)</li>\n<li>Respect <code>java.lang.Deprecated</code> annotation even in Scala sources (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/scala/scala/pull/10517\">#10517</a> by <a href=\"https://github.com/kapunga\"><code>@​kapunga</code></a>)</li>\n<li>Optimize tail recursion on effectively final methods even when <code>final</code> keyword is absent (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/scala/scala/pull/10629\">#10629</a> by <a href=\"https://github.com/som-snytt\"><code>@​som-snytt</code></a>)</li>\n<li>Add <code>-Xlint:pattern-shadow</code> to lint pattern varids which are backquotable (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/scala/scala/pull/8806\">#8806</a> by <a href=\"https://github.com/som-snytt\"><code>@​som-snytt</code></a>)</li>\n<li>In mixed compilation, allow Java sources to reference <code>MODULE$</code> (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/scala/scala/pull/10644\">#10644</a> by <a href=\"https://github.com/som-snytt\"><code>@​som-snytt</code></a>)</li>\n<li>Scaladoc: re-align <code>-doc-source-url</code> behavior with 2.12 (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/scala/scala/pull/10581\">#10581</a> by <a href=\"https://github.com/lrytz\"><code>@​lrytz</code></a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Known issues</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>When upgrading to 2.13.13, existing users of <code>-Xsource:3</code> should explicitly consider switching to <code>-Xsource:3-cross</code>. Some behaviors of <code>-Xsource:3</code> have changed, e.g. in result type inference for inherited methods; see <a href=\"https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/guides/migration/tooling-scala2-xsource3.html\">new doc page</a> for details</li>\n<li>Some library authors who were already using <code>-Xsource:3</code> are getting MiMa failures when upgrading to 2.13.13 and switching from <code>-Xsource:3</code> to <code>-Xsource:3-cross</code>.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #16361 16361.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

Description\r\n\r\nMoves Druid SQL autocomplete information into the `dsql` mode itself and out of flexible-query-input to allow any `AceEditor` instance access to those completions via the mode.\r\n\r\nSome other Ace-related changes:\r\n- Convert dsql and hjson modes to TypeScript\r\n- Avoid adding local completions to the global langTools extension in flexible-query-input &mdash; ensures that completions are scoped to a specific component instance and do not leak across instances\r\n- Change font size to 12 in all editors\r\n- Make `theme` configurable via static

Description\r\n\r\nWith this PR changes, MSQ tasks (MSQControllerTask and MSQWorkerTask) only load the required lookups during querying and ingestion, based on the value of `CTX_LOOKUPS_TO_LOAD` key

`ONLY_REQUIRED`\r\n\r\nI verified that only the required lookups were being loaded in the following operations:\r\n1. MSQ query using non-reversible lookup in `LOOKUP()` function.\r\n```sql\r\nselect * from \"druid\".\"test-ds-1\" where LOOKUP(name, 'lookupname') is not null\r\n```\r\n\r\n2.

Description\r\n\r\nThis pr contains a few fixes for clustering keys when stored in the Druid table catalog.\r\n\r\n1. `DESC` order clustering keys is disallowed; descending clustering keys is not supported at this time by Druid, but previously users could create / update a catalog table with clustering keys with `DESC` order via api. This is now disallowed.\r\n2. Fixed a bug where when partitionedBy is defined for a table in the catalog, the user would still have to specify this partitioning if they also wished to define the clustering keys at query time. The error in such a case was coming from the SQL parsing layer. I've updated the respective ftl files to allow for this, and this validation has now moved to the `DruidSqlValidator`. In such a case the user should be able to omit the partitioning at query time, and still specify the clustering at query time.\r\n3. Added more tests.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces the ability to change the task count on the supervisor without the need to resubmit the spec. This could be used in cases where an user want to scale the supervisor depending on some external factors in his environment. In order to use the current post call, we need to do an extra get call for the current spec and it could also change in between those calls.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `SupervisorResource`\r\n * `SeekableStreamSupervisorSpec`\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Release Notes:\r\nIntroduces a new Supervisor API to update the task count with out getting to know the complete supervisor spec.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/pull/16068 modified `DimensionHandlerUtils` to accept complex types to be dimensions. This had an unintended side effect of allowing complex types to be joined upon (which wasn't guarded explicitly, it doesn't work). \r\nThis PR modifies the IndexedTable to reject building the index on the complex types to prevent joining on complex types. The PR adds back the check in the same place, explicitly.\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `MyFoo`\r\n * `OurBar`\r\n * `TheirBaz`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Impact\r\n\r\nNo one in the Druid community seems to be using the codecov visualization to analyse code coverage.\r\nMost contributors look at the reports generated by jacoco itself and use that to ensure full coverage.\r\n\r\nIn the future, if we feel the need to re-enable it we may uncomment the

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be!

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #4345 .\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion.
