introduced in https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/38905\r\nThere is redefine `DeprecationWarning`, `PendingDeprecationWarning` which are ignored by default in Python, however the problem that it use Prepend/Insert\r\n\r\n```\r\n# From CaptureWarningsPlugin\r\n00 = {tuple: 5} ('always', None, <class 'PendingDeprecationWarning'>, None, 0)\r\n01 = {tuple: 5} ('always', None, <class

result error might not happen if `airflow.exceptions.RemovedInAirflow3Warning` raisedduring test run because it subclass of `DeprecationWarning` and in this case rule `'always', None, <class 'DeprecationWarning'>, None, 0` will choose instead of `'error', None, <class 'airflow.exceptions.RemovedInAirflow3Warning'>, None, 0`\r\n\r\nAfter changes it update already existed and defined values

absence of task names in the DAG details API necessitates separate calls for task and DAG information, hindering process efficiency.\r\nclose https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/37564\r\n\r\nUse case/motivation\r\nCurrently, task names are not included in the DAG details API endpoint. Tasks represent the execution component of a DAG also various API endpoints require task names. Therefore, to retrieve task names, one must query the \"/dags/{dag_id}/tasks\" endpoint. Additionally, to obtain basic DAG details, the \"/dags/{dag_id}/details\" endpoint is utilized. In my use case, automation of certain processes necessitates both DAG information and task names. Consequently, the need to utilize two separate API endpoints slows down the overall process, particularly considering the multitude of DAGs. It would be advantageous to consolidate this information into a single API call, considering that tasks are integral part of a DAG.\r\n\r\nApproach\r\nAdded new schema\"DAGDetailSchemaWithTasksInfo\" to DagSchema.py for task ID information.

have a lot of ways to change screen sizes in the grid view. Its a bit of a mess. You can collapse/expand the filter bar, you can collapse/expand the grid view, you can collapse/expand the details view, and you can only toggle everything from the logs and graph views.\r\n\r\nInstead:\r\n- remove the ability to hide the details view. The new run and task duration pages are good to see more details of run history\r\n- Merge the two collapse filter/grid buttons into a single \"Full screen\" button and have that visible on all pages not just logs+graph\r\n\r\n\r\n<img width=\"910\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-04-16 at 1 50 51 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/airflow/assets/4600967/8314a296-09cc-4e89-930e-3c56313712ce\">\r\n\r\n<img

This way, user can easily control the size of the event and also ensure proper matching, when the same two prefixes are passed to different operators. I am also removing the list of files that was saved for the purpose of lineage datasets, introduced in #35838\r\n\r\nWhen reviewing, please take a look at test cases to see how the code will behave

This way, user can easily control the size of the event and also ensure proper matching, when the same two prefixes are passed to different operators. I am also removing the list of files that was saved for the purpose of lineage datasets, introduced in #31350 .\r\n\r\nWhen reviewing, please take a look at test cases to see how the code will behave

is a huge PR being result of over a 100 commits made by a number of people in ##36052 and #37638. It switches to Connexion 3 as the driving backend\r\nimplementation for both - Airflow REST APIs and Flask app that powers Airflow UI. It should be largely\r\nbackwards compatible when it comes to behaviour of both APIs and Airflow Webserver views, however due to decisions made by Connexion 3 maintainers, it changes heavily the technology stack used under-the-hood:\r\n\r\n1) Connexion App is an ASGI-compatible Open-API spec-first\r\n   framework using ASGI as an interface between webserver\r\n   and Python web application. ASGI is an asynchronous\r\n   successor of WSGI.\r\n\r\n2) Connexion itself is using Starlette to run asynchronous\r\n   web services in Python.\r\n\r\n3) We continue using gunicorn appliation server that still\r\n   uses WSGI standard, which means that we can continue using\r\n   Flask and we are usig standard Uvicorn ASGI webserver that\r\n   converts the ASGI interface to WSGI interface of Gunicorn\r\n\r\nSome of the problems handled in this PR\r\n\r\nThere were two problem was with session handling:\r\n\r\n* the get_session_cookie - did not get the right cookie - it returned \"session\" string. The right fix was to change cookie_jar into cookie.jar because this is where apparently TestClient of starlette is holding the cookies (visible when you debug)\r\n\r\n* The client does not accept \"set_cookie\" method - it accepts passing cookies via \"cookies\" dictionary - this is the usual httpx client\r\n  - see  https://www.starlette.io/testclient/ - so we have to set cookie directly in the get method to try it out\r\n\r\nAdd \"flask_client_with_login\" for tests that neeed flask client\r\n\r\nSome tests require functionality not available to Starlette test client as they use Flask test client specific features - for those we have an option to get flask test client instead of starlette one.\r\n\r\nFix error handling for new connection 3 approach\r\n\r\nError handling for Connexion 3 integration needed to be reworked.\r\n\r\nThe way it behaves is much the same as it works in main:\r\n\r\n* for API errors - we get application/problem+json responses\r\n* for UI erros - we have rendered views\r\n* for redirection - we have correct location header (it's been missing)\r\n* the api error handled was not added as available middleware in the www tests\r\n\r\nIt should fix all test_views_base.py tests which were failing on lack of location header for redirection.\r\n\r\nFix wrong response is tests_view_cluster_activity\r\n\r\nThe problem in the test was that Starlette Test Client opens a new connection and start new session, while flask test client uses the same database session. The test did not show data because the data was not committed and session was not closed - which also failed sqlite local tests with \"database is locked\" error.\r\n\r\nFix test_extra_links\r\n\r\nThe tests were failing again because the dagrun created was not committed and session not closed. This worked with flask client that used the same session accidentally but did not work with test client from Starlette. Also it caused \"database locked\" in sqlite / local tests.\r\n\r\nSwitch to non-deprecated auth manager\r\n\r\nFix to test_views_log.py\r\n\r\nThis PR partially fixes sessions and request parameter for test_views_log. Some tests are still failing but for different reasons - to be investigated.\r\n\r\nFix views_custom_user_views tests\r\n\r\nThe problem in those tests was that the check in security manager was based on the assumption that the security manager was shared between the client and test flask application - because they were coming from the same flask app. But when we use starlette, the call goes to a new process started and the user is deleted in the database - so the shortcut of checking the security manager did not work.\r\n\r\nThe change is that we are now checking if the user is deleted by calling /users/show (we need a new users READ permission for that)\r\n - this way we go to the database and check if the user was indeed deleted.\r\n\r\nFix test_task_instance_endpoint tests\r\n\r\nThere were two reasons for the test failed:\r\n\r\n* when the Job was added to task instance, the task instance was not merged in session, which means that commit did not store the added Job\r\n\r\n* some of the tests were expecting a call with specific session and they failed because session was different. Replacing the session with mock.ANY tells pytest that this parameter can be anything - we will have different session when when the call will be made with ASGI/Starlette\r\n\r\nFix parameter validation\r\n\r\n* added default value for limit parameter across the board. Connexion 3 does not like if the parameter had no default and we had not provided one - even if our custom decorated was adding it. Adding default value and updating our decorator to treat None as `default` fixed a number of problems where limits were not passed\r\n\r\n* swapped openapi specification for /datasets/{uri} and /dataset/events. Since `{uri}` was defined first, connection matched `events` with `{uri}` and chose parameter definitions from `{uri}` not events\r\n\r\nFix test_log_enpoint tests\r\n\r\nThe problem here was that some sessions should be committed/closed but also in order to run it standalone we wanted to create log templates in the database - as it relied implcitly on log templates created by other tests.\r\n\r\nFix test_views_dagrun, test_views_tasks and test_views_log\r\n\r\nFixed by switching to use flask client for testing rather than starlette. Starlette client in this case has some side effects that are also impacting Sqlite's session being created in a different thread and deleted with close_all_sessions fixture.\r\n\r\nFix test_views_dagrun\r\n\r\nFixed by switching to use flask client for testing rather than starlette. Starlette client in this case has some side effects that are also impacting Sqlite's session being created in a different thread and deleted with close_all_sessions fixture.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

release\r\n`8.1.0` of the `cncf-kubernetes` provider, which is also a [dependency](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/37793/files#diff-95ed7631b172975c14b35fb4eeefebef992f7a1d1631d47a7222587ed94d8a07R36)\r\nfor the latest release of the `google` provider `10.17.0`. \r\nAs a result, `google` provider `10.17.0` raises an `ImportError` for the optional\r\nprovider `cncf-kubernetes` dependency for versions `<8.1.0`. This PR resolves \r\nthis issue by suggesting with an `AirflowOptionalProviderFeatureException`\r\nto upgrade the optional provider version to `>=8.1.0`\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

alembic autogeneration is not working as expected and the tests were not detecting it because we use DBs created from the ORM to run tests.\r\nWhen a change is made in the ORM and the ORM is used to initialize the database for tests, the changes in the ORM will appear the same with what is in the migration file. To be sure that both match, we have to compare the database generated using the migration file to the database that could be created from the ORM.\r\nTo fix this, I added 'use_migration_file' arg to resetdb function and updated the db reset in conftest to use migration file during test db reset.\r\n\r\nAs part of this fix, I also updated mismatching constraint names. The update was done in the migration file instead of the ORM as I take the ORM as the source of truth. New airflow users create their DB from the ORM with the correct naming because we have a naming convention. Old airflow users would have to upgrade to use these names from ORM instead of the reverse.\r\n\r\nI also removed the `sqlite_sequence` table which is specific to sqlite and not needed for anything. An alternative would be to add `sqlite_autoincrement` to table args in the ORM and migration but this table is not that

So we would also need to \r\ndiscuss what could be done for the released google provider.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

Previously the deferrable mode was implemented in a way that made most of the task execution run in the sync mode, and only after the execution was finished, the control was passed to the trigger, where it only checked the job status (that was by this time completed) and then immediately returned.\r\n\r\nList of changes:\r\n- Add new methods to `DataflowHook` to be used for the deferrable mode. The methods will start a Dataflow job and then exit returning the job data. \r\nThe existing hook methods are left without changes and are still used for the sync mode.\r\n- Add code to update XCOM with Dataflow job_id in both sync and deferrable modes.\r\n- Update unit tests\r\n- Small refactoring of data types and function parameters\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes.

#37443\r\nrelated: #37443\r\n\r\nWe have been using this feature in Airflow 2.3.4 in the legacy log page by applying regex against lines to apply color for them. It\r\nreceived positive feedback from users since it's helpful in quickly identifying lines causing error while reading large log fies. This adds the feature to the new log tab in the grid. Users can set additional keywords besides common keywords like error and exception to highlight them since we found cases like \"fail\", \"access denied\", \"missing\" etc from trigger logs emitted by systems outside our Airflow that also were helpful in debugging but maybe not applicable to everyone. This also handles case where the log line already has an ansi code to wrap remaining part of the line with color to avoid conflict.\r\n\r\nError and exception lines in red color with bold style\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/airflow/assets/3972343/8de30a01-073c-477f-9932-f2ecc4570d80)\r\n\r\nCase where warn keyword is present but it has it's own ansi code to handle nested ansi codes\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/airflow/assets/3972343/aec8ab83-5d85-4648-8074-4e6c03933ac5)\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-04-14T13:14:23Z","updated_at":"2024-06-03T14:15:09Z","closed_at":"2024-05-02T16:16:26Z","merged_at":"2024-05-02T16:16:26Z","merge_commit_sha":"0b08abd4390b8d6c2b80a041c2405d46f2bc8bb0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ryanahamilton","id":3267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanahamilton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"pierrejeambrun","id":14861206,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODYxMjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14861206?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun","html_url":"https://github.com/pierrejeambrun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545584474,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTg0NDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:webserver","name":"area:webserver","color":"a9db3f","default":false,"description":"Webserver related Issues"},{"id":2172800071,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcyODAwMDcx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:new-feature","name":"type:new-feature","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog: New Features"},{"id":2514952451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTE0OTUyNDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:UI","name":"area:UI","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"Related to UI/UX.

Explain\r\nThere is no issue linked to this PR.\r\n\r\nThe documentation of the LivyOperator had an error:\r\n`:param polling_interval: time in seconds between polling for job completion. Don't poll for values >= 0`\r\n\r\nActually, the operator will not poll when the `polling_interval` is less than or equal (<=) to 0. This PR changes that >= sign to a <= in the docs.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

times in the past, it happened that bug(s) were introduced in Airflow codebase which breaks all system tests. The issue is, we do not run system in Airflow CI, thus these bugs get merged and we need to fix them afterwards.\r\n\r\nTo prevent that, I'd like to add a step in Airflow CI to catch these bugs before merging. The idea is to create a dummy system test (a simple DAG using EmptyOperator) and run this system test as part of the CI.\r\n\r\n[See Slack thread](https://apache-airflow.slack.com/archives/C06K9Q5G2UA/p1712772405407389).\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.
