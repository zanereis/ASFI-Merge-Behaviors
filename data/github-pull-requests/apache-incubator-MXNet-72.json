this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

the fork\r\n\r\n## Description ##\r\n(Brief description on what this PR is about)\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [ ] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2017-12-15T12:25:22Z","updated_at":"2017-12-15T12:31:29Z","closed_at":"2017-12-15T12:26:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4f2087ed15d0068ead73ade7b7d6766f37280e3f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9088/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9088/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/9088/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/e85a0f4d8ac4b0ab3f772364fa23c33e7bf37f54","head":{"label":"butkovic:master","ref":"master","sha":"e85a0f4d8ac4b0ab3f772364fa23c33e7bf37f54","user":{"login":"butkovic","id":2838040,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MzgwNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2838040?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/butkovic","html_url":"https://github.com/butkovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/butkovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/butkovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/butkovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/butkovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/butkovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/butkovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/butkovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/butkovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/butkovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":87422212,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4NzQyMjIxMg==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"butkovic/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"butkovic","id":2838040,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MzgwNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2838040?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/butkovic","html_url":"https://github.com/butkovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/butkovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/butkovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/butkovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/butkovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/butkovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/butkovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/butkovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/butkovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/butkovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/butkovic/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

recent inclusion of the Khatri-Rao operator breaks `make test`. We add a\r\nmissing include to resolve the error.\r\n\r\nFixes Issue #9076\r\n\r\n## Description ##\r\n\r\nPR #7781 adds the Khatri-Rao operator. The automated testing framework in the PR reported that all tests passed. However, locally running `make test` causes the build error described in Issue #9076 . This small change adds the necessary headers to fix the build issue.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Testing ###\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ make\r\n$ make test\r\n$ ./build/tests/cpp/mxnet_unit_tests\r\n$ python -m pytest

Description ##\r\nMakes people aware of the script prepare_mkl.sh and how to use it.\r\nSince MKL is faster on Intel CPUs and we recommend using MKL on this [page](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/how_to/perf.html), it's good to make it easier for people to build with MKL\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nN/A\r\n- [ ] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] CMake instructions in file\r\n- [x] install from source instructions on website\r\n","created_at":"2017-12-15T00:47:34Z","updated_at":"2017-12-15T01:09:38Z","closed_at":"2017-12-15T01:08:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1074db22aec205e873be12aa52a220f9fa668ad6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9077/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9077/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/9077/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/8ef8aed17f9bcfd433d0647349c5107e24e93de6","head":{"label":"rahul003:build-help","ref":"build-help","sha":"8ef8aed17f9bcfd433d0647349c5107e24e93de6","user":{"login":"rahul003","id":3457240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NTcyNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3457240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003","html_url":"https://github.com/rahul003","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":96937059,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NjkzNzA1OQ==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"rahul003/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rahul003","id":3457240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NTcyNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3457240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003","html_url":"https://github.com/rahul003","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rahul003/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nThe README files and examples are updated with details about instructions to run the examples in \"ctc\" and \"recommenders\" folder.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [ ] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [y] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [y] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\nRemove torch support.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [ ] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

have spent ~4 hours working through the demo trying to get it working. It has problems so severe that I don’t think it’s worth trying to salvage it. This example might make a good blog entry for people who are thoroughly versed in Kaldi, an Open Source automatic speech recognition (ASR) project, and who are interested in an MXNet wrapper for it but does not stand alone as an introductory example to speech recognition suitable for inclusion in the MXNet repo. Alternatively, an ASR expert could perhaps rework this example and resubmit it if it illustrated general MXNet concepts.\r\n\r\nSpecific criticisms that lead me to propose removing the demo altogether:\r\n\r\n- Depends on Kaldi which is a bear to install and compile (but I got there in the end).\r\n- The example includes a Python wrapper around Kaldi which does not compile. Editing the makefile to remove the link dependency on ../thread/kaldi-thread.a allowed it to compile but I have no idea if the result will work as intended.\r\n- The discussion of preparing data gives no hint of where you would download compatible data or transcripts. It tells you to run Kaldi scripts that barf and ask where your Fisher transcripts are.\r\n- The example has vague instructions to go read the Kaldi docs but doesn't even give a title or topic that you should go looking for.\r\n- The tutorial is full of acronyms that appear to have ASR-specific meanings that are never explained and that a user of MXNet would not reasonably be expected to know e.g. AMI does not mean \"Amazon Machine Image\". Similarly TIMIT is a speech

Description ##\r\nWith this change, I have added the steps to build and validate MXNet with NCCL libraries.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [y] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [y] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [y] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

registered in a single operator, they will use the same resource instance which seems weird as stated in https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/8463.\r\n\r\nIs the original way intended? Is there a use case that first temp workspace is allocated to store intermediate results, then we know the size of second temp workspace whose results also need the content of first temp workspace?

[x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\nThis patch fixes a performance regression that is causing a roughly 20% slowdown in some inference scenarios.  I haven't investigated in depth how wide spread this issue is, but at a minimum it's affecting inference with a resnet model and a batch size of 1.\r\n\r\nI'm not totally familiar with the commit that makes the change, but to me it looks like the regression occurred because of a refactor in the graph executor that improves readability.  The performance problems occur because we introduce a number of cudaStreamSyncronize calls which lower our overall gpu utilization (likely due to a restricted execution plan that leads to a lower overall SM occupancy).  It's not clear to me if this would cause any issues when running inference in a non-GPU environment.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that the change in operator segmentation behaviour was intended and has other useful implications.  If so we should be able to modify the code so that we get both the intended benefits, and the faster performance.\r\n\r\n## Investigation ##\r\nAfter verifying the regression on a demonstration model we did some high level measurements to see if any trends emerged.  We saw two stats that helped diagnose the issue.   First the gpu usage during inference dropping from ~95% to ~85%.  Second we had a large increase in the number of cudaStreamSynchronize calls.\r\n\r\n0.9.5  cuda calls:\r\n```\r\nTime(%)      Time     Calls       Avg       Min       Max  Name\r\n 30.59%  16.6780s      2401  6.9463ms  5.7920us  31.420ms  cudaStreamSynchronize\r\n 22.59%  12.3190s    105146  117.16us  22.368us  12.287ms  cudaLaunch\r\n 17.10%  9.32475s        16  582.80ms  195.55us  4.66099s  cudaStreamCreateWithFlags\r\n```\r\n0.12 cuda calls:\r\n```\r\n==2726== API calls:\r\nTime(%)      Time     Calls       Avg       Min       Max  Name\r\n 46.13%  37.5542s     48601  772.70us  5.1200us  5.5922ms  cudaStreamSynchronize\r\n 17.72%  14.4214s    102946  140.09us  22.432us  9.2845ms  cudaLaunch\r\n 11.32%  9.21538s        16  575.96ms  222.94us  4.60608s  cudaStreamCreateWithFlags\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote the number of cudaStreamSynchronize calls increases from 2401 to 48601.  Once this PR has been applied our models return to exactly 2401 calls.\r\n\r\nWe verified that the cudaStreamSynchronize calls were responsible for the low GPU utilization with some further profiling.  The following images show a timeline view of one inference call through the model.  A timespan is highlighted at the top of the timeline to show relative performance.  Gaps in the compute row show the relative utilization of the GPU.  I've also added a little instrumentation that adds our existing profiling names to nvidia's tool's timeline (very small change, will PR it separately after Chris's awesome profiling work is merged).  This also highlights the difference in behaviour when we're segmenting operators.  The 0.9.5 and 1.0 (with this PR)  builds both group operators together into a single segment for a single inference.  The 0.12 build breaks operators apart into several segments.\r\n\r\n0.9.5:\r\n![0 9 5_with_tracing](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7443219/33946102-2c9979e4-e021-11e7-9e31-1e0baa0d690c.png)\r\n\r\n0.12:\r\n![0 12_with_tracing](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7443219/33946110-34296d18-e021-11e7-8d18-6d40b797405c.png)\r\n\r\n1.0 with PR applied:\r\n![1 0_with_fix_and_tracing](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7443219/33946125-3b93cb98-e021-11e7-82ab-440211a6fb0b.png)\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Performance regression fix.  While refactoring this function it appears we introduced an unexpected side-effect: a number of cudaStreamSyncCalls which caused a slowdown in performance.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- This needs to be reviewed by someone with familiarity with this graph executor.  Tests are passing, and the performance tests I've run have been sped up by a factor of ~20%, but I would like to have a discussion around the performance implications of this change.  Could this negatively affect some aspect of MXNet performance (for example CPU inference, large batched prediction, etc?).  \r\n-  This change also groups together several operators into the same reported segment from the profiler.  Is this the right thing to do from the users's perspective?

Description ##\r\nThis example was not compatible with python3. I made necessary changes.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x]  Some changes to modelzoo.py to make it compatible with both python2 and python3.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- I have not verified the accuracy or validity of results.\r\n","created_at":"2017-12-13T09:37:02Z","updated_at":"2017-12-18T20:17:38Z","closed_at":"2017-12-18T20:17:38Z","merged_at":"2017-12-18T20:17:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"c6d4e7fd82eb9fce3f0ce878352babb34b261b44","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9053/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9053/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/9053/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/32e9d91d7d4043e8fc116f2c6f9e6d34ced96aad","head":{"label":"wangkechun:fix-python3-compatibility","ref":"fix-python3-compatibility","sha":"32e9d91d7d4043e8fc116f2c6f9e6d34ced96aad","user":{"login":"wangkechun","id":4022174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMjIxNzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4022174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangkechun","html_url":"https://github.com/wangkechun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangkechun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangkechun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangkechun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangkechun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangkechun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangkechun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangkechun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangkechun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangkechun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":113434126,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTM0MzQxMjY=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"wangkechun/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wangkechun","id":4022174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMjIxNzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4022174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangkechun","html_url":"https://github.com/wangkechun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangkechun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangkechun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangkechun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangkechun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangkechun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangkechun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangkechun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangkechun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangkechun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wangkechun/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nSometimes user might want to pass a specific environment variable when launching a distributed training job using launch.py. I have found it very helpful to set variables like PYTHONPATH or one of the [many MXNet environment variables](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/how_to/env_var.html). \r\nAlso we might sometimes want to set a variable like OMP_NUM_THREADS or MXNET_CPU_WORKER_NTHREADS only for server processes. And others for worker processes only.\r\n\r\nThis PR allows user to pass such variables easily\r\n**Requires this PR in dmlc-core to be merged https://github.com/dmlc/dmlc-core/pull/346**\r\n\r\n- For both server and worker processes\r\n```... --env VARIABLE1```\r\nPicks value of the environment variable which is set when launch.py is called. If a variable passed doesn't have value set, raises an error to ensure user isn't making a mistake.\r\n\r\n- For server processes only\r\n```... --env-server VARIABLE:VALUE```\r\n\r\n- For worker processes only\r\n```... --env-worker VARIABLE:VALUE```\r\n\r\nPassing multiple such arguments is allowed\r\nFor example ```--env VARIABLE1 --env VARIABLE2```\r\n\r\nSupports cluster types of `local` and `ssh`\r\n\r\n@anirudh2290 This is a better version of something I had sent earlier that you had reviewed\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\nRefer description\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nThis doesn't break anything which is already there. \r\nIf someone doesn't want to use it, it doesn't affect them. But I believe this would be very useful","created_at":"2017-12-13T03:03:09Z","updated_at":"2018-04-06T08:36:30Z","closed_at":"2018-01-31T19:34:13Z","merged_at":"2018-01-31T19:34:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"134c584b22298dc714d7868629ea020f8538c365","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9049/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9049/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/9049/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/e3e4a289d03de9e446ac4f416da31454365622eb","head":{"label":"rahul003:envs","ref":"envs","sha":"e3e4a289d03de9e446ac4f416da31454365622eb","user":{"login":"rahul003","id":3457240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NTcyNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3457240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003","html_url":"https://github.com/rahul003","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":96937059,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NjkzNzA1OQ==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"rahul003/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rahul003","id":3457240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NTcyNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3457240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003","html_url":"https://github.com/rahul003","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rahul003/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\n  - This example was not compatible with python3. I made necessary changes. \r\n  - I also updated the README with the Pre-reqs I needed to make the example work on the CONDA AMI (mxnet_p36/mxnet_p27 envs)\r\n  - I have also verified that the example works with rllab and rllab3 conda envs.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Some changes to a3c.py to make it compatible with both python2 and python3.\r\n- [x] Some changes to rl_data.py to make it compatible with python3.\r\n- [x] Updated README\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n  - I have tested on the Deep Learning AMI with Conda (Ubuntu) (ami-405ade3a)\r\n  - I fixed it such that it works with both python 3.x and python 2.x\r\n  - I have not verified the accuracy or validity of results.\r\n","created_at":"2017-12-13T01:09:14Z","updated_at":"2018-01-25T18:58:43Z","closed_at":"2018-01-25T18:58:43Z","merged_at":"2018-01-25T18:58:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"52219e8b52761e142fd64242a785d7a956aebf37","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9046/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9046/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/9046/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/a6a649ed54b48d2fa5b754af35754fc9a72a892e","head":{"label":"mbaijal:fix_example_a3c","ref":"fix_example_a3c","sha":"a6a649ed54b48d2fa5b754af35754fc9a72a892e","user":{"login":"mbaijal","id":30911248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTExMjQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30911248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal","html_url":"https://github.com/mbaijal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":100059674,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDAwNTk2NzQ=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"mbaijal/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mbaijal","id":30911248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTExMjQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30911248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal","html_url":"https://github.com/mbaijal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mbaijal/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

MXNet.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-12-12T23:41:07Z","updated_at":"2017-12-13T03:14:41Z","closed_at":"2017-12-13T03:14:41Z","merged_at":"2017-12-13T03:14:41Z","merge_commit_sha":"6d1f07dcf1a33872ac15b032167584e98a183cc8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9045/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9045/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/9045/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/74dda51191eae35768c532600f4347f623148303","head":{"label":"simoncorstonoliver:master","ref":"master","sha":"74dda51191eae35768c532600f4347f623148303","user":{"login":"simoncorstonoliver","id":11811097,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODExMDk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11811097?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/simoncorstonoliver","html_url":"https://github.com/simoncorstonoliver","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simoncorstonoliver/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simoncorstonoliver/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simoncorstonoliver/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simoncorstonoliver/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simoncorstonoliver/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simoncorstonoliver/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simoncorstonoliver/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simoncorstonoliver/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simoncorstonoliver/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":114026209,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTQwMjYyMDk=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"simoncorstonoliver/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"simoncorstonoliver","id":11811097,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODExMDk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11811097?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/simoncorstonoliver","html_url":"https://github.com/simoncorstonoliver","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simoncorstonoliver/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simoncorstonoliver/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simoncorstonoliver/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simoncorstonoliver/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simoncorstonoliver/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simoncorstonoliver/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simoncorstonoliver/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simoncorstonoliver/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simoncorstonoliver/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/simoncorstonoliver/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nadd zero gradients to rounding operators including 'rint', 'ceil', 'floor', 'trunc', and 'fix'.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] register

Description ##\r\n@szha @sxjscience \r\n\r\nI added the global_clip_norm functionality to a custom module wrapper in this example instead of adding it to `mx.module.Module`\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2017-12-12T20:41:11Z","updated_at":"2018-09-18T23:33:02Z","closed_at":"2017-12-12T21:42:06Z","merged_at":"2017-12-12T21:42:06Z","merge_commit_sha":"06ed4dcb1ab6aa1c506dbd3d7bb052b123f63589","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"sxjscience","id":5178350,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNzgzNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5178350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience","html_url":"https://github.com/sxjscience","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9038/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9038/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/9038/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/1e86c411b909a9fa1586056f3fc385d25b232fc5","head":{"label":"eric-haibin-lin:lm","ref":"lm","sha":"1e86c411b909a9fa1586056f3fc385d25b232fc5","user":{"login":"eric-haibin-lin","id":5545640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDU2NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5545640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":54802325,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NDgwMjMyNQ==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"eric-haibin-lin/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"eric-haibin-lin","id":5545640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDU2NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5545640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\n\r\n* Remove duplicate broken GAN code from example.\r\n* We have a working and tested GAN tutorial with MXNet in tutorials.\r\n* Made some minor language corrections and Python compatibility.\r\n* Added ref in the tutorials index to show GAN tutorials in mxnet site\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [X] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [X] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [X] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2017-12-11T23:44:50Z","updated_at":"2017-12-13T02:36:15Z","closed_at":"2017-12-13T02:36:15Z","merged_at":"2017-12-13T02:36:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"ca79cfcfb20a2fe130d540258789cebea2750c2e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9030/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/9030/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/9030/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/5a1187e43ab1279b1668f860dbb1264bb0f776bd","head":{"label":"sandeep-krishnamurthy:fix_gan","ref":"fix_gan","sha":"5a1187e43ab1279b1668f860dbb1264bb0f776bd","user":{"login":"sandeep-krishnamurthy","id":3403674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDM2NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3403674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeep-krishnamurthy","html_url":"https://github.com/sandeep-krishnamurthy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeep-krishnamurthy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeep-krishnamurthy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeep-krishnamurthy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeep-krishnamurthy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeep-krishnamurthy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeep-krishnamurthy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeep-krishnamurthy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeep-krishnamurthy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeep-krishnamurthy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":100398734,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDAzOTg3MzQ=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"sandeep-krishnamurthy/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sandeep-krishnamurthy","id":3403674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDM2NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3403674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeep-krishnamurthy","html_url":"https://github.com/sandeep-krishnamurthy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeep-krishnamurthy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeep-krishnamurthy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeep-krishnamurthy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeep-krishnamurthy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeep-krishnamurthy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeep-krishnamurthy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeep-krishnamurthy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeep-krishnamurthy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandeep-krishnamurthy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sandeep-krishnamurthy/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nReplaces older deprecated mshadow style addition (using += operator) with kernel launch.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Replaces older mshadow style addition (using += operator) with kernel launch.\r\n- [x] Change initialization of const_vars to slightly faster way\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- Makes the addition operation 3-5x faster\r\n- Looks like increase CPU usage","created_at":"2017-12-11T22:34:08Z","updated_at":"2018-03-26T17:16:42Z","closed_at":"2018-03-26T16:34:49Z","merged_at":"2018-03-26T16:34:49Z","merge_commit_sha":"cfc09410ddbcc194e1c6743be814cfa761af2d00","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"thirdwing","id":1547093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDcwOTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1547093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing","html_url":"https://github.com/thirdwing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thirdwing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"cjolivier01","id":11234557,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjM0NTU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11234557?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01","html_url":"https://github.com/cjolivier01","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"marcoabreu","id":18629099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI5MDk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18629099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu","html_url":"https://github.com/marcoabreu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"sergeykolychev","id":25470168,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NDcwMTY4",

Description ##\r\nRework of the RNN API: \r\n- Change the input to be of shape `seq_len X batch.size`, this will ease the use of existing arrayIter on NLP models. \r\n- Add support for inference on explicit unrolled models (used when training on CPU rather than the `symbol.RNN`)\r\n- Inference support for both one-to-one (language model, time-series) and seq-to-one (classification). \r\n\r\nOptimizers:\r\nFor all optimizers, gradient clipping is now performed by `mx.nd.clip`, avoiding to back and forth with R array resulting in some speedup. \r\n\r\nFollowing comments on lack of exmaples supporting the R package, exemples have been added: \r\nhttps://jeremiedb.github.io/mxnet_R_bucketing/index.html\r\nIf there's interest, idea to is add other examples, in the spirit of the

finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n-

finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best

complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Fixing pylint errors\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n-

resnet101 is smaller than resnet50, which seems very weird.\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- The names of extract-layers for resnet101 in symbol/symbol_factory.py\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nFor resnet50, the numbers of layers for different stages are [3, 4, 6, 3], so the extract-layers for SSD are 3+4+6-1=12 and 3+4+6+3-1=15，as the code in symbol_factory.py:\r\n`from_layers = ['_plus12', '_plus15', '', '', '', '']`\r\nThe numbers of layers for resnet101 are [3, 4, 23, 3],  so the extract-layers for SSD should be 3+4+23-1=29 and 3+4+23+3-1=32.\r\nThe right code for resnet101 should be:\r\n`from_layers = ['_plus29', '_plus32', '', '', '',

Description ##\r\nFixes compatibility issues of example/rcnn and example/sparse and example/gluon/tree_lstm to run with python3\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage\r\n- [x] For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are well-documented. \r\n- [x] To my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\nTo ensure compatibility of example/rcnn with py2.7 and py3.6\r\n- [x] Change cPickle to pickle for py3\r\n- [x] Remove xrange to use builtins.range\r\n- [x] Change how modules are imported\r\n- [x] Update usage of numpy to ensure we are not calling deprecated APIs. Example using float to index an array has been removed from numpy. Now we need to cast it to int first.\r\n- [x] Updated readme\r\n\r\nTo ensure compatibility of example/sparse with py3.6\r\n- [x] An assert statement was comparing string and float causing type error on py3.6\r\n\r\nTo ensure example/sparse runs on Mac\r\n- [x] Updates scripts to fetch data to use common API for Mac and Linux. Removed wget.\r\n- [x] Updated get_bz2_data to extract file line by line. Else it fails on Mac as MacOS doesn't support that feature for large files.\r\n- [x] Added get_zip_data in test_utils, which works on both Mac and Linux\r\n\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- example/rcnn now needs pip packages builtins even for py2.7 so we can use same API for both py2.7 and py3.6. This is not a big deal since this is an advanced example and already requires 4-5 pip packages to run\r\n\r\n@anirudh2290 especially for test_utils changes\r\n@eric-haibin-lin especially for sparse changes

Description ##\r\nDoes not run with python 3.x due to usage of `xrange`\r\nThe default environment `PongDeterministic-v3` is deprecated. \r\nSome updates to Readme needed\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage\r\n- [x] For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are well-documented. \r\n- [x] To my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] example/reinforcement-learning/parallel_actor_critic/model.py uses xrange() in line 91. This has been changed to range() in python3\r\n- [x] The default env as PongDeterministic-v3. However this is deprecated. Changed to PongDeterministic-v4 \r\n- [x] Some updates to README\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n - I have tested on the Deep Learning AMI with Conda (Ubuntu) (ami-405ade3a)\r\n - I have verified that the change for python 3.x does not break the example on python 2.x\r\n - I have not verified the accuracy or validity of results.\r\n","created_at":"2017-12-07T23:58:16Z","updated_at":"2017-12-08T19:25:12Z","closed_at":"2017-12-08T19:25:12Z","merged_at":"2017-12-08T19:25:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"f154101db0f50a78866bab474fa85f6e86dad763","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/8991/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/8991/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/8991/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/c2a777ffef67c2aa63a07886040ee6569d1f0ba3","head":{"label":"mbaijal:fix_example_parallelActor","ref":"fix_example_parallelActor","sha":"c2a777ffef67c2aa63a07886040ee6569d1f0ba3","user":{"login":"mbaijal","id":30911248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTExMjQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30911248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal","html_url":"https://github.com/mbaijal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":100059674,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDAwNTk2NzQ=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"mbaijal/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mbaijal","id":30911248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTExMjQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30911248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal","html_url":"https://github.com/mbaijal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbaijal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mbaijal/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

PR introduces the necessary changes to switch to the new CI. After this PR has been merged, the old CI will stop working and start throwing errors. Due to this fact, make sure that this PR is only getting merged while I'm ready for the handover.\r\n\r\nKey changes:\r\n- Switch to Ubuntu16.04 and CUDA 8 due to the fact that CUDA 8 is supported on most GPU platforms\r\n- Split Jenkins-jobs into CPU and GPU tasks\r\n- Add debug output to Perl-tests\r\n- Disabled one documented flaky test\r\n\r\nMost of the work is not part of this PR but rather all the infrastructure setup which we're maintaining in a different repository.

[x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage\r\n- [n/a] For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are well-documented. \r\n- [x] To my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Update `gluon.Parameter.__repr__`\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nPrinting any `gluon.parameters` (e.g., `print(net.collect_params())`) will

Description ##\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces `split_like` layer, which is similar to `reshape_like` layer. The layer takes the first dim of the input shape (lhs), and splits it into two dims, which it gets from the reference shape (rhs).\r\n\r\nThis layer implements a simple operation, but this operation has a big payoff for high-level frameworks that want to do fast bucketing. If you want to do fast bucketing you have to avoid unrolling / compiling the network more than once. For GPU we have layers like `RNN` layer which make this possible. But an additional requirement is that the sequence length *never* appear in the `shape` parameters of any `Reshape` ops, otherwise we are forced to make new symbols instead of simply reshaping old executors.\r\n\r\nCurrently, there is a common idiom which unfortunately requires we hardcode the sequence length into a `Reshape`. My `split_like` allows us to implement this idiom without hardcoding sequence length. The idiom I mentioned is a way to efficiently map an operation over a sequence: \r\n\r\n1) take a tensor, with shape `in1 = (seq, batch, d1, d2, ...)`\r\n2) merge the first two dims with `Reshape` using `shape=(-3,-2)` to give `in2 = (seq * batch, d1, d2, ...)`\r\n3) perform some ordinary op or ops that naturally maps over the batch dimension to give `out1 = (seq * batch, e1, e2, ..)`\r\n4) split the first dimension of the output back into two to give `out2 = (seq, batch, e1, e2, ...)`\r\n\r\n`seq` doesn't have to come before `batch`, it could be the other way, but the point is the same: in step 4 we need to reverse the split operation that we performed in step 2. Unfortunately, we cannot hard-code either the batch size or the max sequence length into a `Reshape` layer, because if we do, we prevent an existing executor from being resized when we wish change that parameter. But there is no simple way to go from `seq * batch` to `seq, batch` without knowing at least one of them and hardcoding it into the `Reshape`, using current MXNet ops.\r\n\r\nsplit_op makes this easy: you can just use the original tensor `in1` as the reference tensor, giving us `out2 = split_layer(lhs=out1, rhs=in1)`.\r\n\r\nWhen you have a large number of buckets, the performance savings from doing this can be enormous. It is possible to cache the original JSON and attempt to build a template of it such that you can produce new JSON more cheaply, but that is a complicated and hacky prospect compared to having the executor be naturally resizable, which `split_layer` allows.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [ ] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\nI get `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'cpplint'`, but the code is mostly copy-pasted from `reshape_like`, so it is probably ok?\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage\r\n`split_like` is almost a direct copy of `reshape_like`, which seems to have no direct test coverage. What should I do? \r\n- [x] For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are well-documented. \r\n- [x] To my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n\r\n1. This seems like the only simple way of achieving executor resizability for the idiom I mentioned, but maybe I'm missing something and it is already possible!\r\n\r\n2. Also, I am wondering if we should maybe introduce a `merge_dims` layer that is equivalent to the current `shape=(-3,-2)` spec of `Reshape`. It would be more symmetrical, and the truth is that these two operations \"split\" and \"merge\" are all I ever used those codes in `Reshape` for anyway. So if we introduce \"merge' we could deprecate those old codes and perhaps remove them in a few versions time? That would also help `Reshape` get better backward shape inference, and keep it simpler for people to

Description ##\r\nAvoid using additional Alloc/Free on Storage() in order to pack distribution parameters into tensors on cpu/gpu. Instead allocate a single chunk of workspace and partition this into three temporal arrays (for seeds as well as the two distribution parameters). This resolves issue #8863. \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [ x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage\r\n- [ x] For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are well-documented. \r\n- [ x] To my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

Description ##\r\nThe previous implementation of sparse batch loader waits for the number of data instances reaches `batch_size` before allocating the buffer for copy (unlike dense batch loader, we don't know the actual buffer size to allocate since the number of non-zeros varies). However, such delayed allocate is buggy when batch size is extremely large, because the `DataInst` returned by `base_` is only a reference to the data. By the time copy happens, the referenced data might already be updated by the parser. \r\n\r\nThis PR modifies the sparse batch loader to be almost the same as batch loader, except that:\r\n- data buffer is allocated based on estimation, and adjusted when capacity is not sufficient\r\n- before returning the output, the shape of tensor has to reflect the actual number of elements in the tensor.\r\n\r\n@cjolivier01 @reminisce @anirudh2290  @ZiyueHuang\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [ ] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage\r\n- [ ] For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated.
