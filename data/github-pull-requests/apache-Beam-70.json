PR closes #24468 by implementing a `FileWriteSchemaTransformConfiguration`.  See the task description for further detail.  Additionally, this PR implements a `FileWriteSchemaTransformFormatProvider` `@AutoService` for cleaner routing of a given format i.e. xml, csv, etc to its appropriate `FileIO.Write`, to be implemented in a later PR (see #24472 ).\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

#22372\r\n\r\nWhen we create temp tables, the jobs we send will naturally have `CREATE_IF_NEEDED` disposition. Users are facing a problem when writing with `CREATE_NEVER`, which makes providing a schema optional. When no schema is provided, the job that creates temp tables is sent with a null schema and an error is thrown. \r\n\r\nThe changes in this PR uses a DynamicDestinations object that returns the schema of the table when the user-provided schema is null.\r\n\r\nNote: this code was removed in #17365 because SchemaUpdateOptions were introduced for temp tables.

PR enables Kafka consumer logic in Beam examples. Playground server pre-loads (via Kafka producer) dataset data in scope of RunCode call.\r\nDatasets content is stored under playground/backend/datasets/ to be easily accessed for development, but in future we could add support for larger datasets backed by public GCS buckets\r\nIt also requires additional runtime parsing of `bootstrap.server` in RunCode, to replace `kafka_server:9292` with actual host/port, `localhost:12345` or like. This logic is only implemented for Java. Kafka support in Python/Go SDK requires cross-language transforms implemented first [link](https://github.com/akvelon/beam/blob/b3963b75d3555a143a2e95ae913e956624ad5cc6/sdks/python/apache_beam/io/kafka.py).\r\n\r\n### Examples layout\r\n`beam-playground` embedded yaml tag is extended with `datasets` and `emulators`, for these examples appropriate pg_datasets entities are created\r\nSee more detailed example in CONTRIBUTE.md\r\n\r\n### Playground GRPC API extensions\r\n`datasets` in `RunCode` request and in `PrecompiledObject` message, returned by `GetPrecompiledObjects`\r\nClient flow:\r\n- receive example's datasets in a PrecompiledObject. Represent it nicely\r\n- When RunCode is called, fill in `datasets` with a given struct\r\n\r\n### Kafka Mock Cluster\r\nunder-hood implementation based on confluent-kafka-go client and its [librdkafka CGo bindings](https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka/blob/master/src/rdkafka_mock.h) to create MockCluster which dynamically opens port (2 bootstrapServers by default), dynamically creates a topic with 4 (by default) partitions when consumer is connected. (Beam example execution connects to that dynamically opened port).\r\nOnly consumer logic is implemented for now. To allow producing into a topic from Beam example, we need to extend API with returned artifacts to represent them safely for user.\r\n\r\n### Tasks\r\naddresses #23980\r\naddresses #23981\r\naddresses #23799\r\n\r\n### Follow ups\r\n- GCS-backed datasets\r\n- Cross-language transforms\r\n- Python SDK support with example\r\n- Go SDK support with example\r\n- Producing from Kafka Beam examples\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Overview\r\n\r\nThis PR closes #21412 through a `PubsubWriteSchemaTransformProvider` implementation and closes #24206 through modifications to `PubsubClient` and related subclasses.  #24462 delegates future work to increase `PubsubWriteSchemaTransformProviderIT`'s coverage.\r\n\r\n`PubsubWriteSchemaTransformProvider` instantiates a `SchemaTransform` via a  `PubsubWriteSchemaTransformConfiguration` received as a beam `Row`.  `SchemaTransform` builds a `PTransform<PCollectionRowTuple, PCollectionRowTuple>` that uses the `PubsubWriteSchemaTransformConfiguration` to instantiate a `PubsubIO.Write<PubsubMessage>`.  Receiving a tagged `Row` via `PCollectionRowTuple` input, the transform converts the `Row` input into `PubsubMessage`s that it then writes to a Pub/Sub topic.\r\n\r\n```mermaid\r\nflowchart TD\r\n    \r\n    provider([PubsubWriteSchemaTransformProvider])\r\n    transform[\"PTransform&lt;PCollectionRowTuple, PCollectionRowTuple&gt;\"]\r\n    row[\"Row (PubsubWriteSchemaTransformConfiguration)\"]\r\n    input[\"Row (attributes|timestamp|payload|...user fields)\"]\r\n    pubsub[\"PubsubIO.Write&lt;PubsubMessage&gt;\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n    subgraph \"PTransform&lt;PCollectionRowTuple, PCollectionRowTuple&gt;\"\r\n         input --> PubsubRowToMessage\r\n         PubsubRowToMessage --> PubsubMessage\r\n         PubsubMessage --> pubsub\r\n    end\r\n\r\n    subgraph PubsubWriteSchemaTransformProvider\r\n        row --> provider\r\n        provider --> transform\r\n    end\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nThe following serves as a guide to aid the reviewer provided in order of the aforementioned flow.\r\n\r\n### Validate PCollectionRowTuple input tags\r\n\r\nA valid `PCollectionRowTuple` input tag check passes when there is a single tagged Row.\r\n\r\n`PubsubWriteSchemaTransformProviderTest::testInvalidTaggedInput` detects errors in this transform's initial PCollectionRowTuple input validation.\r\n\r\n### Build PubsubRowToMessage compatible Schema\r\n\r\nPrior to applying the Row input to PubsubIO.Write, the transform needs to convert the `PCollection<Row>` input into `PCollection<PubsubMessage>`.  Since the transform delegates this work to `PubsubRowToMessage`, we need a compatible Schema.  See PR #23897 for details on this expected Schema.  Additionally  it depends on a validation of the source Row input Schema and `PubsubWriteSchemaTransformConfiguration`.\r\n\r\n`PubsubWriteSchemaTransformProviderTest::testBuildTargetSchema` detects errors in this step.\r\n\r\n### Validate Row input Schema against Configuration\r\n\r\nThe transform allows a user to name their own input fields.  However in order to comply with the expected `PubsubRowToMessage` Schema (see PR #23897), the configuration needs to inform the transform what those fields are named.  Therefore, validation at this step needs to determine:\r\n\r\n1. Does the configuration state the name of the expected attributes, timestamp, or payload field when such fields do not exist in the input Schema?\r\n2. Are the types of the named input Schema fields compatible with the expected `PubsubRowToMessage` Schema (see PR #23897)?\r\n\r\nNote that validation at this step ignores whether the input Schema contains both a payload field and user fields.  This validation is performed by `PubsubRowToMessage`.\r\n\r\n`PubsubWriteSchemaTransformProviderTest::testValidateSourceSchemaAgainstConfiguration` detects errors in this step.\r\n\r\n### Convert Row input to compatible PubsubMessage Row input\r\n\r\nPrior to transforming into `PubsubMessage`s, the transform needs to convert the original Row input into that which is compatible for `PubsubRowToMessage`.  The transform delegates this work to the `ConvertForRowToMessage` DoFn.\r\n\r\n`PubsubWriteSchemaTransformProviderTest::testConvertForRowToMessageTransform` detects errors in this step.\r\n\r\n### Validate Target Schema against Pub/Sub Schema\r\n\r\nPub/Sub provides an optional ability for users to configure a schema (not to be confused with a Beam Schema).  In this context, we need to validate whether serialized payload is compatible with the Pub/Sub schema.  The `validateTargetSchemaAgainstPubsubSchema` method performs this check.  Modifying the existing `PubsubClient` and its implementing `PubsubGrpcClient` provides the needed dependency to query for a Pub/Sub topic's schema and convert to a Beam Schema.  This PR adds additional testing coverage to the existing tests for `PubsubClient` and its related subclasses.  Additionally, this PR adds a new `PubsubSchemaIT` integration test to detect errors in `PubsubClient`'s ability to detect a topic schema and convert to a Beam Schema.\r\n\r\n### Convert Row input to PubsubMessage\r\n\r\nSee PR #23897 for a description of `PubsubRowToMessage`.\r\n\r\n### Build PubsubIO.Write\r\n\r\nFinally after converting the Row input into `PubsubMessage`s, the transform applies the resulting PCollection to `PubsubIO.Write<PubsubMessage>`.  `PubsubWriteSchemaTransformProvider::buildPubsubWrite` performs this and `PubsubWriteSchemaTransformProviderTest::testBuildPubsubWrite` tests this stage.\r\n\r\n`PubsubWriteSchemaTransformProviderIT` begins the work of integration test coverage.  It only validates whether a simple payload bytes containing Row input writes to a Pub/Sub topic.  Attempts at validating avro formatted serialized Row payloads failed and future work needs to increase `PubsubWriteSchemaTransformProviderIT`'s coverage.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

#24225\r\n\r\nExtend API with\r\n```\r\nPrecompiledObject.url_notebook\r\nPrecompiledObject.url_vcs\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis backend is compatible with new and old examples(those having `urlNotebook&urlVCS` and those having only the `path` field), and with new and old frontend client API which consumes `url_notebook/url_vcs` or `link` respectively.\r\n\r\nOnce the new frontend API is deployed, we can get rid of `link` in API and `path` in example entities in a separate PR.\r\nFor a detailed roll out description see below link:\r\n\r\nPart 1: #24402\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for

the current implementation only the first element of the context gets considered to predicate if the rows should be forward propagated to the next PTransform, and that same context is used to print a warn log with the information of what happened. \r\n\r\nPreviously the full context was used to print the warn information providing full information on the ingestion error (quota related messages or details on internal errors) which now are lost complicating the troubleshooting of a pipeline. \r\n\r\nThis change makes again possible printing the full information returned by BQ during ingestion errors.  \r\n\r\n**Please** add a meaningful description for your change here\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

`urlNotebook`\r\n\r\nProposed update sequence:\r\n\r\n1. backend deployed. New backend API provides all fields: `link`, `url_vcs`, and `url_notebook` to not break old frontend client\r\n2. examples CD step is run. Both backend versions, old and new consume different pg_examples fields\r\n3. frontend merged, deployed. New frontend consumes only `url_vcs` and `url_notebook`, ignores `link`\r\nOptional steps:\r\n- `path` is removed from pg_examples, infrastructure merged, examples CD step applied\r\n- `link` field removed from proto and marked reserved\r\n- backend, frontend deployed\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Postgres databases for the SpannerIO change stream connector. The connector should be able to query when (1) both the metadata database and the change streams database are GSQL (2) when both the metadata database and the change streams database are Postgres (3) when the metadata database is in Postgres and the change streams database is in GSQL and (4) when the metadata database is in GSQL and the change streams database is in Postgres\r\n\r\nThis PR first does an initial lookup to determine whether or not the change streams database and the metadata database are Postgres in SpannerIO. Then, it makes different queries to the metadata table and to the change stream depending on whether or not the database is postgres. It also creates the metadata table differently depending on whether the metadata database is Postgres. Finally, it maps received records into ChangeStreamRecords differently depending on whether or not the change stream is in a Postgres database or not.","created_at":"2022-11-29T02:41:28Z","updated_at":"2022-12-01T06:34:51Z","closed_at":"2022-12-01T06:34:50Z","merged_at":"2022-12-01T06:34:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"57e5b69f45bfc11c6060a76888364383ac71d9a4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1836391716,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxODM2MzkxNzE2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/labels/java","name":"java","color":"001cf2","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1842356709,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxODQyMzU2NzA5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/labels/io","name":"io","color":"9ee534","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1842938092,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxODQyOTM4MDky","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/labels/gcp","name":"gcp","color":"9ee534","default":false,"description":""},{"id":3888027569,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAwi8tc7nvpex","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/labels/Next%20Action:%20Reviewers","name":"Next

to issue #23324.\r\n---\r\nFurther testing with the changes from #23411 showed that especially for larger batch-processed datasets (tested with datasets with sizes of around 110 million rows) profited from removing the GroupByKey step and therefore making the actual WriteBatch process non-blocking and up to 20% faster. This was due to the bounded nature of batch-processed PCollections where the groupByKey completely blocked the writing to bigtable until the whole collection was keyed. Changes been fully tested. Maybe there is a chance they still make the initial introduction of bigtableio in release-2.44.0.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

the default encoding of Go slices to use the beam iterable coder format.\r\n\r\nTechnically this is the same format as before, but without a length prefix.\r\n\r\nChanging coder implementations are generally a breaking change, however this only applies to streaming updates or when trying to re-use the internal pipeline coders. The benefit of cross language compatibility longer term, in a format expected by go users, is perceived to be a larger benefit.\r\n\r\nFixes #24339.\r\n\r\nAdditionally:\r\n* Changes to make exec structure debugging more consistent and useful.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
