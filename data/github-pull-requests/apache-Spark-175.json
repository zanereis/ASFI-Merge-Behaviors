for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nSet `IS_TESTING` to true in `BenchmarkBase`, before running benchmarks.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently benchmark can be done via 2 ways: `spark-submit`, or SBT command. However in the former Spark will miss some properties such as `IS_TESTING`, which is necessary to turn on/off certain behavior like codegen (`spark.sql.codegen.factoryMode`). Therefore, the result could differ between the two. In addition, the benchmark GitHub workflow is using the spark-submit approach.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to

this WIP since it is also affected by multiple attempts. The data from previous attempt from level db needs to be deleted when the server identifies a new attempt with the registration. This will depend on changes in #32007\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis change enables push-based shuffle service (`RemoteBlockPushResolver`) to store state in level DB. This helps to restore the state when the NM is restarted.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe changes are needed to support work preserving restart which was missing from push-based shuffle services\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded unit tests. We have a version of this change internally which has been running in production.\r\n\r\nLead-authored-by: Min Shen mshen@linkedin.com\r\nCo-authored-by: Chandni Singh

new Path(path)\r\ncommitter = ctor.newInstance(committerOutputPath, context)\r\n\r\n```\r\nFor dynamicPartitionOverwrite code is now selecting the stagingDir \r\n\r\nNow after commitJob  in the

not.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded the Unit test and also added the tested  manually the scenario using the spark

*hard*, making it clearer why executors have exited could help.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes a new column on the executor page.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nK8s unit test updated to validate exec loss reasons are passed through regardless of exec alive state, manual testing to validate the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis patch introduces a new option to specify the minimum number of offsets to read per trigger i.e. minOffsetsPerTrigger and maxTriggerDelay to avoid the infinite wait for the trigger.\r\n\r\nThis new option will allow skipping trigger/batch when the number of records available in Kafka is low. This is a very useful feature in cases where we have a sudden burst of data at certain intervals in a day and data volume is low for the rest of the day. \r\n'maxTriggerDelay' option will help to avoid cases of infinite delay in scheduling trigger and the trigger will happen irrespective of records available if the maxTriggerDelay time exceeds the last trigger. It would be an optional parameter with a default value of 15 mins. This option will be only applicable if minOffsetsPerTrigger is set.\r\n\r\nminOffsetsPerTrigger option would be optional of course, but once specified it would take precedence over maxOffestsPerTrigger which will be honored only after minOffsetsPerTrigger is satisfied.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThere are many scenarios where there is a sudden burst of data at certain intervals in a day and data volume is low for the rest of the day. Tunning such jobs is difficult as decreasing trigger processing time increasing the number of batches and hence cluster resource usage and adds to small file issues. Increasing trigger processing time adds consumer lag. This patch tries to address this issue.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThis patch was tested manually on a cluster where the job was running for a full one day with data burst happening once a day.\r\nHere is the picture of databurst and hence consumer lag:\r\n<img width=\"1198\" alt=\"Screenshot 2021-04-29 at 11 39 35 PM\"

specified trigger time): \r\n<img width=\"1154\" alt=\"Burst Time\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1044003/116997919-12f8dc00-acfb-11eb-9b0a-98387fc67560.png\">\r\n\r\nThis is job behavior during non-burst time where it is skipping 2 to 3 triggers and running once every 9 to 13.5 mins\r\n<img width=\"1154\" alt=\"Non Burst Time\"

minOffsetsperTrigger set:\r\n\r\n| Run | Data Size | Number of Batch Runs | Number of Files |\r\n| ------------- | ------------- |------------- |------------- |\r\n| Normal Run | 54.2 GB | 320 | 21968

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR fixes a bug in [SPARK-35266](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-35266) that creates benchmark files in the invalid path with the wrong name. \r\ne.g. For `BLASBenchmark`, \r\n- AS-IS: Creates `benchmarksBLASBenchmark-results.txt` in `{SPARK_HOME}/mllib-local/`\r\n- TO-BE: Creates `BLASBenchmark-results.txt` in `{SPARK_HOME}/mllib-local/benchmarks/`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAs you can see in the above example, new benchmark files cannot be created as intended due to this bug. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAfter building Spark, manually tested with the following command:\r\n```\r\nSPARK_GENERATE_BENCHMARK_FILES=1 bin/spark-submit --class \\\r\n    org.apache.spark.benchmark.Benchmarks --jars \\\r\n    \"`find . -name '*-SNAPSHOT-tests.jar' -o -name

benchmark files as intended (`BLASBenchmark-results.txt` in `{SPARK_HOME}/mllib-local/benchmarks/`).

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR added the multiple columns adding support for Spark scala/java/python API.\r\n- Expose `withColumns` with Map input as public API in Scala/Java\r\n- Add `withColumns` in PySpark\r\n\r\nThere was also some discussion about adding multiple columns in past JIRA([SPARK-1225](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-12225), [SPARK-26224](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-26224)) and [ML](http://apache-spark-developers-list.1001551.n3.nabble.com/DISCUSS-Multiple-columns-adding-replacing-support-in-PySpark-DataFrame-API-td31164.html).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThere were a private method `withColumns` can add columns at one pass [1]:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/b5241c97b17a1139a4ff719bfce7f68aef094d95/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/Dataset.scala#L2402\r\n\r\nHowever, it was not exposed as public API in Scala/Java, and also PySpark user can only use `withColumn` to add one column or replacing the existing one column that has the same name. \r\n\r\nFor example, if the PySpark user want to add multiple columns, they should call `withColumn` again and again like:\r\n```Python\r\ndf.withColumn(\"key1\", col(\"key1\")).withColumn(\"key2\", col(\"key2\")).withColumn(\"key3\", col(\"key3\"))\r\n```\r\nAfter this patch, the user can use the `withColumns` with map of colume name and column :\r\n```Python\r\ndf.withColumns({\"key1\":  col(\"key1\"), \"key2\":col(\"key2\"), \"key3\": col(\"key3\")})\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, this PR exposes `withColumns` as public API, and also adds `withColumns` API in PySpark .\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Add new multiple columns adding test, passed\r\n- Existing test,

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n`EXPLAIN CODEGEN <query>` (and Dataset.explain(\"codegen\")) prints out the generated code for each stage of plan. The current implementation is to match `WholeStageCodegenExec` operator in query plan and prints out generated code (https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/debug/package.scala#L111-L118 ). This does not work with AQE as we wrap the whole query plan inside `AdaptiveSparkPlanExec` and do not run whole stage code-gen physical plan rule eagerly (`CollapseCodegenStages`). This introduces unexpected behavior change for EXPLAIN query (and Dataset.explain), as we enable AQE by default now.\r\n\r\nThe change is to explain code-gen for the current executed plan of AQE.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nMake `EXPLAIN CODEGEN` work same as before.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo (when comparing with latest Spark release 3.1.1).\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdded unit test in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nPySpark added pinned thread mode at https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/24898 to sync Python thread to JVM thread. Previously, one JVM thread could be reused which ends up with messed inheritance hierarchy such as thread local especially when multiple jobs run in parallel. To completely fix this, we should enable this mode by default.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo correctly support parallel job submission and management.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, now Python thread is mapped to JVM thread one to one.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests should cover

Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdded the new test in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is rather a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/30518 that should be ported back to `branch-3.1` too.\r\n`STOP_AT_DELIMITER` was mistakenly used twice. The duplicated `STOP_AT_DELIMITER` should be `SKIP_VALUE` in the documentation.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo correctly document.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing

request?\r\nThis patch proposes to make CatalogString contains nullable information to help understand Casting failure message.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhen trying to cast ArrayType/MapType/StructType from containing NULL to not contain NULL, we will get a confusing failure message.\r\nHere's a example:\r\n```scala\r\n  test(\"casting from nullable to non-nullable\") {\r\n    // ArrayType\r\n    val arrayContainsNull = Literal.create(Seq(\"contains\", \"null\", null),\r\n      ArrayType(StringType, containsNull = true))\r\n    val arrayCastRet = cast(arrayContainsNull, ArrayType(StringType, containsNull = false))\r\n\r\n    // MapType\r\n    val mapValueContainsNull = Literal.create(\r\n      Map(\"a\" -> \"false\", \"b\" -> \"true\", \"c\" -> null),\r\n      MapType(StringType, StringType, valueContainsNull = true))\r\n    val mapCastRet =\r\n      cast(mapValueContainsNull, MapType(StringType, StringType, valueContainsNull = false))\r\n\r\n    // StructType\r\n    val structContainsNull = Literal.create(\r\n      Row(0),\r\n      StructType(Seq(StructField(\"i\", IntegerType, nullable = true)))\r\n    )\r\n    val structCastRet =\r\n      cast(structContainsNull, StructType(Seq(StructField(\"i\", IntegerType, nullable = false))))\r\n\r\n\r\n    assert(!arrayCastRet.resolved && !mapCastRet.resolved && !structCastRet.resolved)\r\n\r\n    println(arrayCastRet.typeCheckFailureMessage)\r\n    println(mapCastRet.typeCheckFailureMessage)\r\n    println(structCastRet.typeCheckFailureMessage)\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nFailure massage before this path:\r\n```\r\ncannot cast array<string> to array<string>\r\ncannot cast map<string,string> to map<string,string>\r\ncannot cast struct<i:int> to struct<i:int>\r\n```\r\nFrom the above error message, it is not clear why the error is reported, because the data type before and after is the same.\r\nTherefore, we need to specify nullable info for ArrayType/MapType/StructType in the Catalog String to identify the reason for Casting Failures.\r\n\r\nFailure massage after this patch:\r\n```\r\ncannot cast array<string(nullable=true)> to array<string(nullable=false)>\r\ncannot cast map<string,string(nullable=true)> to map<string,string(nullable=false)>\r\ncannot cast struct<i:int(nullable=true)> to struct<i:int(nullable=false)>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a nullable message in the catalog string with the format '(nullable=true/false)', so we can observe why the error message is returned when the cast failed due to nullability.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, this PR changes the Catalog String of ArrayType, MapType and StructType.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIn `StaticInvoke`, when result is nullable, don't box the return value if its type is primitive.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to apply boxing when the method return value is of primitive type, and it would hurt performance a lot if the method is simple. The check is done in `Invoke` but not in `StaticInvoke`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded a

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nBump to `dev.ludovic.netlib:2.0` which provides JNI-based wrappers for BLAS, ARPACK, and LAPACK. Theseare not taking dependencies on GPL or LGPL libraries, allowing to provide out-of-the-box support for hardware acceleration when a native library is present (this is still up to the end-user to install such library on their system, like OpenBLAS, Intel MKL, and libarpack2).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nGreat performance improvement for ML-related workload on vanilla-distributions of Spark.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUsers now take advantage of hardware acceleration as long as a native library is installed (like OpenBLAS, Intel MKL and libarpack2).\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nSpark test-suite + dev.ludovic.netlib testsuite.\r\n\r\n#### JDK8:\r\n```\r\n[info] OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM 1.8.0_292-b10 on

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to make StaticInvoke able to find method with given method name even the parameter types do not exactly match to argument classes.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnlike `Invoke`, `StaticInvoke` only tries to get the method with exact argument classes. If the calling method's parameter types are not exactly matched with the argument classes, `StaticInvoke` cannot find the method.\r\n\r\n`StaticInvoke` should be able to find the method under the cases too.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes. `StaticInvoke` can find a method even the argument classes are not exactly matched.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCTAS with location clause acts as an insert overwrite. This can cause problems when there are subdirectories within a location directory.\r\nThis causes some users to accidentally wipe out directories with very important data. We should not allow CTAS with location to a non-empty directory.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nHive already handled this scenario: HIVE-11319\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nsql(\"\"\"create external table  `demo_CTAS`( `comment` string) PARTITIONED BY (`col1` string, `col2` string) STORED AS parquet location '/tmp/u1/demo_CTAS'\"\"\")\r\nsql(\"\"\"INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE demo_CTAS partition (col1='1',col2='1') VALUES ('abc')\"\"\")\r\nsql(\"select* from demo_CTAS\").show\r\nsql(\"\"\"create table ctas1 location '/tmp/u2/ctas1' as select * from demo_CTAS\"\"\")\r\nsql(\"select* from ctas1\").show\r\nsql(\"\"\"create table ctas2 location '/tmp/u2' as select * from demo_CTAS\"\"\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore the fix: Both create table operations will succeed. But values in table ctas1 will be replaced by ctas2 accidentally.\r\n\r\nAfter the fix: `create table ctas2...` will throw `AnalysisException`:\r\n\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: CREATE-TABLE-AS-SELECT cannot create table with location to a non-empty directory /tmp/u2 . To allow overwriting the existing non-empty directory, set 'spark.sql.legacy.allowNonEmptyLocationInCTAS' to true.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, if the location directory is not empty, CTAS with location will throw AnalysisException\r\n\r\n```\r\nsql(\"\"\"create table ctas2 location '/tmp/u2' as select * from demo_CTAS\"\"\")\r\n```\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: CREATE-TABLE-AS-SELECT cannot create table with location to a non-empty directory /tmp/u2 . To allow overwriting the existing non-empty directory, set 'spark.sql.legacy.allowNonEmptyLocationInCTAS' to true.\r\n```\r\n\r\n`CREATE TABLE AS SELECT` with non-empty `LOCATION` will throw `AnalysisException`. To restore the behavior before Spark 3.2, need to  set `spark.sql.legacy.allowNonEmptyLocationInCTAS` to `true`. , default value is `false`.\r\nUpdated SQL migration guide.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTest case added in SQLQuerySuite.scala\r\n","created_at":"2021-05-01T05:44:55Z","updated_at":"2024-01-16T03:44:48Z","closed_at":"2021-05-20T06:13:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ca9d706d26560a7fcabe5327dd296e5ab2390142","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32411/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32411/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/32411/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/bafe546ae09a9a0c0e118aef3d4e7f05b30c8ed3","head":{"label":"vinodkc:br_fixCTAS_nonempty_dir","ref":"br_fixCTAS_nonempty_dir","sha":"bafe546ae09a9a0c0e118aef3d4e7f05b30c8ed3","user":{"login":"vinodkc","id":9795818,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3OTU4MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9795818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodkc","html_url":"https://github.com/vinodkc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodkc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodkc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodkc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodkc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodkc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodkc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodkc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodkc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodkc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":86780265,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4Njc4MDI2NQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"vinodkc/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vinodkc","id":9795818,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3OTU4MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9795818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodkc","html_url":"https://github.com/vinodkc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodkc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodkc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodkc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodkc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodkc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodkc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodkc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodkc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinodkc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vinodkc/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1. Extend Spark SQL parser to support parsing of:\r\n    - `INTERVAL YEAR TO MONTH` to `YearMonthIntervalType`\r\n    - `INTERVAL DAY TO SECOND` to `DayTimeIntervalType`\r\n2. Assign new names to the ANSI interval types according to the SQL standard to be able to parse the names back by Spark SQL parser. Override the `typeName()` name of `YearMonthIntervalType`/`DayTimeIntervalType`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo be able to use new ANSI interval types in SQL. The SQL standard requires the types to be defined according to the rules:\r\n```\r\n<interval type> ::= INTERVAL <interval qualifier>\r\n<interval qualifier> ::= <start field> TO <end field> | <single datetime field>\r\n<start field> ::= <non-second primary datetime field> [ <left paren> <interval leading field precision> <right paren> ]\r\n<end field> ::= <non-second primary datetime field> | SECOND [ <left paren> <interval fractional seconds precision> <right paren> ]\r\n<primary datetime field> ::= <non-second primary datetime field | SECOND\r\n<non-second primary datetime field> ::= YEAR | MONTH | DAY | HOUR | MINUTE\r\n<interval fractional seconds precision> ::= <unsigned integer>\r\n<interval leading field precision> ::= <unsigned integer>\r\n```\r\nCurrently, Spark SQL supports only `YEAR TO MONTH` and `DAY TO SECOND` as `<interval qualifier>`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nShould not since the types has not been released yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the affected tests such as:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/testOnly *SQLQueryTestSuite -- -z interval.sql\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/testOnly

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis allows `ScalarFunction` implemented in Java to optionally specify the magic method `invoke` to be static, which can be used if the UDF is stateless. Comparing to the non-static method, it can potentially give better performance due to elimination of dynamic dispatch, etc.\r\n\r\nAlso added a benchmark to measure performance of: the default `produceResult`, non-static magic method and static magic method.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFor UDFs that are stateless (e.g., no need to maintain intermediate state between each function call), it's better to allow users to implement the UDF function as static method which could potentially give better performance. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes. Spark users can now have the choice to define static magic method for `ScalarFunction` when it is written in Java and when the UDF is stateless.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded new

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSince SPARK-22757, `KubernetesUtils` has been used as an important utility class by all K8s modules and `ExternalClusterManager`s. This PR aims to promote `KubernetesUtils` to `DeveloperApi` in order to maintain it officially in a backward compatible way at Apache Spark 3.2.0.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nApache Spark 3.1.1 makes `Kubernetes` module GA and provides an extensible external cluster manager framework. To have `ExternalClusterManager` for K8s environment, `KubernetesUtils` class is crucial and needs to be stable. By promoting to a subset of K8s developer API, we can maintain these more sustainable way and give a better and stable functionality to K8s users.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, `Since` annotations denote the last function signature changes because these are going to become public at Apache Spark 3.2.0.\r\n\r\n| Version | Function Name |\r\n|-|-|\r\n| 2.3.0 | parsePrefixedKeyValuePairs |\r\n| 2.3.0 |

This is a piece of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/32385. And this PR only adds checksum functionality at the shuffle writer side.\r\n\r\nBasically, the idea is to wrap a `MutableCheckedOutputStream`* upon the `FileOutputStream` while the shuffle writer generating the shuffle data. But the specific wrapping places are a bit different among the shuffle writers due to their different implementation:\r\n\r\n* `BypassMergeSortShuffleWriter` -  wrap on each partition file\r\n* `UnsafeShuffleWriter` - wrap on each spill files directly since they doesn't require aggregation, sorting\r\n* `SortShuffleWriter` - wrap on the `ShufflePartitionPairsWriter` after merged spill files since they might require aggregation, sorting\r\n\r\n\r\n\\* `MutableCheckedOutputStream` is a variant of `java.util.zip.CheckedOutputStream` which can change the checksum calculator at runtime.\r\n\r\nAnd we use the `Adler32`, which uses the CRC-32 algorithm but much faster, to calculate the checksum as the same as `Broadcast`'s checksum.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, added a new conf: `spark.shuffle.checksum`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded unit tests.\r\n","created_at":"2021-04-29T16:22:28Z","updated_at":"2021-07-20T05:07:00Z","closed_at":"2021-07-17T05:23:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"66759791e081ad012d20483f3d6a083dd4e4d6a1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32401/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32401/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/32401/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4bdde58a3791691f275968b117eeff260ef3016f","head":{"label":"Ngone51:add-checksum-files","ref":"add-checksum-files","sha":"4bdde58a3791691f275968b117eeff260ef3016f","user":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":114185286,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTQxODUyODY=","name":"spark","full_name":"Ngone51/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSupporting '--packages' in the k8s cluster mode\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn spark 3, '--packages' in the k8s cluster mode is not

I expected that managing dependencies by using packages like spark 2.\r\n\r\nSpark 2.4.5\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/v2.4.5/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/SparkSubmit.scala\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n     if (!isMesosCluster && !isStandAloneCluster) {\r\n      // Resolve maven dependencies if there are any and add classpath to jars.

When I tested it, it is very bad experience to me.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nIn my k8s environment, i tested the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR adds a new rule `PullOutGroupingExpressions` to pull out complex grouping expressions to a `Project` node under an `Aggregate`. These expressions are then referenced in both grouping expressions and aggregate expressions without aggregate functions to ensure that optimization rules don't change the aggregate expressions to invalid ones that no longer refer to any grouping expressions.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIf aggregate expressions (without aggregate functions) in an `Aggregate` node are complex then the `Optimizer` can optimize out grouping expressions from them and so making aggregate expressions invalid.\r\n\r\nHere is a simple example:\r\n```\r\nSELECT not(t.id IS NULL) , count(*)\r\nFROM t\r\nGROUP BY t.id IS NULL\r\n```\r\nIn this case the `BooleanSimplification` rule does this:\r\n```\r\n=== Applying Rule org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.optimizer.BooleanSimplification ===\r\n!Aggregate [isnull(id#222)], [NOT isnull(id#222) AS (NOT (id IS NULL))#226, count(1) AS c#224L]   Aggregate [isnull(id#222)], [isnotnull(id#222) AS (NOT (id IS NULL))#226, count(1) AS c#224L]\r\n +- Project [value#219 AS id#222]                                                                 +- Project [value#219 AS id#222]\r\n    +- LocalRelation [value#219]                                                                     +- LocalRelation [value#219]                                          \r\n```\r\nwhere `NOT isnull(id#222)` is optimized to `isnotnull(id#222)` and so it no longer refers to any grouping expression.\r\n\r\nBefore this PR:\r\n```\r\n== Optimized Logical Plan ==\r\nAggregate [isnull(id#222)], [isnotnull(id#222) AS (NOT (id IS NULL))#234, count(1) AS c#232L]\r\n+- Project [value#219 AS id#222]\r\n   +- LocalRelation [value#219]\r\n```\r\nand running the query throws an error:\r\n```\r\nCouldn't find id#222 in [isnull(id#222)#230,count(1)#226L]\r\njava.lang.IllegalStateException: Couldn't find id#222 in [isnull(id#222)#230,count(1)#226L]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter this PR:\r\n```\r\n== Optimized Logical Plan ==\r\nAggregate [_groupingexpression#233], [NOT _groupingexpression#233 AS (NOT (id IS NULL))#230, count(1) AS c#228L]\r\n+- Project [isnull(value#219) AS _groupingexpression#233]\r\n   +- LocalRelation [value#219]\r\n```\r\nand the query works.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, the query works.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR fixes an error in `BenchmarkBase.scala` that occurs when creating a benchmark file in a non-existent directory. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhen submitting a benchmark job using `org.apache.spark.benchmark.Benchmarks` class with `SPARK_GENERATE_BENCHMARK_FILES=1` option, an exception is raised if the directory where the benchmark file will be generated does not exist. \r\nFor more information, please refer to [SPARK-35266](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-35266).  \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAfter building Spark, manually tested with the following command:\r\n```\r\nSPARK_GENERATE_BENCHMARK_FILES=1 bin/spark-submit --class \\\r\n    org.apache.spark.benchmark.Benchmarks --jars \\\r\n    \"`find . -name '*-SNAPSHOT-tests.jar' -o -name '*avro*-SNAPSHOT.jar' | paste -sd ',' -`\" \\\r\n    \"`find . -name 'spark-core*-SNAPSHOT-tests.jar'`\" \\\r\n    \"org.apache.spark.ml.linalg.BLASBenchmark\"\r\n```\r\nIt successfully generated the benchmark result files. \r\n\r\n**Why it is sufficient:**\r\nAs illustrated in the comments in `Benchmarks.scala`, the command below runs all benchmarks and generates the results:\r\n```\r\nSPARK_GENERATE_BENCHMARK_FILES=1 bin/spark-submit --class \\\r\n    org.apache.spark.benchmark.Benchmarks --jars \\\r\n    \"`find . -name '*-SNAPSHOT-tests.jar' -o -name '*avro*-SNAPSHOT.jar' | paste -sd ',' -`\" \\\r\n    \"`find . -name 'spark-core*-SNAPSHOT-tests.jar'`\" \\\r\n    \"*\"\r\n```\r\nOf all the benchmarks (55 benchmarks in total), only `BLASBenchmark` fails due to the proposed issue for the current code in the master branch. Thus, it is currently sufficient to test `BLASBenchmark` to validate this change.

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n~~This PR aims to add a new AQE optimizer rule `DynamicJoinSelection`. Like other AQE partition number configs, this rule add a new broadcast threshold config `spark.sql.adaptive.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold`.~~\r\nThis PR amis to add a flag in `Statistics` to distinguish AQE stats or normal stats, so that we can make some sql configs isolation between AQE and normal.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe main idea here is that make join config isolation between normal planner and aqe planner which shared the same code path.\r\n\r\nActually we do not very trust using the static stats to consider if it can build broadcast hash join. In our experience it's very common that Spark throw broadcast timeout or driver side OOM exception when execute a bit large plan. And due to braodcast join is not reversed which means if we covert join to braodcast hash join at first time, we(AQE) can not optimize it again, so it should make sense to decide if we can do broadcast at aqe side using different sql config.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, a new config `spark.sql.adaptive.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold` added.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIntroduce new shared methods to `ShuffleBlockFetcherIteratorSuite` to replace copy-pasted code. Use modern, Scala-like Mockito `Answer` syntax.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n`ShuffleFetcherBlockIteratorSuite` has tons of duplicate code, like https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/0494dc90af48ce7da0625485a4dc6917a244d580/core/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/storage/ShuffleBlockFetcherIteratorSuite.scala#L172-L185 . It's challenging to tell what the interesting parts are vs. what is just being set to some default/unused value.\r\n\r\nSimilarly but not as bad, there are many calls like the following\r\n```\r\nverify(transfer, times(1)).fetchBlocks(any(), any(), any(), any(), any(), any())\r\nwhen(transfer.fetchBlocks(any(), any(), any(), any(), any(), any())).thenAnswer ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese changes result in about 10% reduction in both lines and characters in the file:\r\n```bash\r\n# Before\r\n> wc core/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/storage/ShuffleBlockFetcherIteratorSuite.scala\r\n    1063    3950   43201 core/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/storage/ShuffleBlockFetcherIteratorSuite.scala\r\n\r\n# After\r\n> wc core/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/storage/ShuffleBlockFetcherIteratorSuite.scala\r\n     928    3609   39053 core/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/storage/ShuffleBlockFetcherIteratorSuite.scala\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt also helps readability, e.g.:\r\n```\r\n    val iterator = createShuffleBlockIteratorWithDefaults(\r\n      transfer,\r\n      blocksByAddress,\r\n      maxBytesInFlight = 1000L\r\n    )\r\n```\r\nNow I can clearly tell that `maxBytesInFlight` is the main parameter we're interested in here.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, test only. There aren't even any behavior changes, just refactoring.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis adds two new additional metrics to `ExternalBlockHandler`:\r\n- `blockTransferRate` -- for indicating the rate of transferring blocks, vs. the data within them\r\n- `blockTransferAvgSize_1min` -- a 1-minute trailing average of block sizes transferred by the ESS\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this enhances `YarnShuffleServiceMetrics` to expose the histogram/`Snapshot` information from `Timer` metrics within `ExternalBlockHandler`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently `ExternalBlockHandler` exposes some useful metrics, but is lacking around metrics for the rate of block transfers. We have `blockTransferRateBytes` to tell us the rate of _bytes_, but no metric to tell us the rate of _blocks_, which is especially relevant when running the ESS on HDDs that are sensitive to random reads. Many small block transfers can have a negative impact on performance, but won't show up as a spike in `blockTransferRateBytes` since the sizes are small. Thus the new metrics to show information around average block size and block transfer rate are very useful to monitor the health/performance of the ESS, especially when running on HDDs. \r\n\r\nFor the `YarnShuffleServiceMetrics`, currently the three `Timer` metrics exposed by `ExternalBlockHandler` are being underutilized in a YARN-based environment -- they are basically treated as a `Meter`, only exposing rate-based information, when the metrics themselves are collected detailed histograms of timing information. We should expose this information for better observability.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, there are two entirely new metrics for the ESS, as documented in `monitoring.md`. Additionally in a YARN environment, `Timer` metrics exposed by the ESS will include more rich timing information.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew unit tests are added to verify that new metrics are showing up as expected.\r\n\r\nWe have been running this patch internally for approx. 1 year and have found it to be useful for monitoring the health of ESS and diagnosing performance

The basic idea is: \r\n\r\nOn the mapper side, we'll wrap a `CheckedOutputStream` upon the `FileOutputStream` to calculate the checksum (use the same checksum calculator `Adler32` with broadcast) for each shuffle block (a.k.a partition) at the same time when we writing map output files.  And similar to the index file, we'll have a checksum file to save these checksums.\r\n\r\nOn the reducer side, we'll also wrap a `CheckedInputStream` upon the `FileInputStream` to read the block.  When block corruption is detected, we'll try to diagnose corruption for the cause:\r\n\r\nFirst, we'll use the `CheckedInputStream` to consume the remaining data of the corrupted block to calculate the checksum (`c1`);\r\n\r\nSecond, the reducer send an RPC request called `DiagnoseCorruption` (which contains `c1`) to the server (where the reducer executed)\r\n\r\nThird, the server will read (using a very small memory) the corresponding block back from the disk and calculate the checksum (`c2`) again for it. And also read back the checksum(`c3`) of the block saved in the checksum file. Then, if `c2 != c3`, we'll suspect the corruption is caused by the disk issue. Otherwise, if `c1 != c3`, we'll suspect the corruption is caused by the network issue. Otherwise, the cause remains unknown. The server then will reply to the reducer with `CorruptionCause` containing the cause.\r\n\r\nFourth, the reducer needs to take action after it receives the cause. If it's a disk issue or unknown, it will throw fetch failure directly. If it's a network issue, it will re-fetch the block later. Also note that, if the corruption happens inside `BufferReleasingInputStream`, the reducer will throw the fetch failure immediately no matter what the cause is since the data has been partially consumed by downstream RDDs.  If corruption happens again after retry, the reducer will throw the fetch failure directly this time without the diagnosis.\r\n\r\nOverall, I think we don't introduce severe overhead with this proposal. In a normal case, the checksum is calculated in the streaming way as well as other streams, e.g., encryption, compression. And the major overhead here is that we need an extra data file traverse in the error case in order to calculate the checksum (`c2`).\r\n\r\nAnd the proposal in this PR is much simpler compared to the previous one https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/15894/ (abandoned due to complexity ), which introduce more overhead as it need to traverse the data file twice for every block. In that proposal, the checksum is appended to each block data, so it's also invasive to the existing code.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nShuffle data corruption is a long-standing issue in Spark. For example, in SPARK-18105, people continually reports corruption issue. However, data corruption is difficult to reproduce in most cases and even harder to tell the root cause. We don't know if it's a Spark issue or not.  With the checksum support for the shuffle, Spark itself can at least distinguish the cause between disk and network, which is very important for users.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes.  \r\n\r\n1) Added a conf `spark.shuffle.checksum` to let user enables/disables the checksum (enabled by default)\r\n2) With checksum enabled, users can know the possible cause of corruption rather than \"Stream is corrupted\" only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n`HadoopVersionInfoSuite` use a separate `ivyPath` to download the jars when create a new `IsolatedClientLoader`,  and the ivy cache directory will be deleted after this suite, so `HadoopVersionInfoSuite` can't reuse `hive-ivy-cache` by specifying environment variables `SPARK_VERSIONS_SUITE_IVY_PATH` like `VersionsSuite` and `HiveVersionSuites`.\r\n\r\nThe main change of this pr is change to use `HiveClientBuilder.ivyPath` to store jars, then we can speed up this test suite with specify environment variables

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR proposes to introduces three new configurations to limit the maximum number of jobs/stages/executors on the timeline view.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIf the number of items on the timeline view grows +1000, rendering can be significantly slow.\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-35229\r\n\r\nThe maximum number of tasks on the timeline is already limited by `spark.ui.timeline.tasks.maximum` so l proposed to mitigate this issue with the same manner.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. the maximum number of items shown on the timeline view is limited.\r\nI proposed the default value 500 for jobs and stages, and 250 for executors.\r\nA executor has at most 2 items (added and removed) 250 is chosen.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nI manually confirm this change works with the following procedures.\r\n```\r\n# launch a cluster\r\n$ bin/spark-shell --conf spark.ui.retainedDeadExecutors=300 --master \"local-cluster[4, 1, 1024]\"\r\n\r\n// Confirm the maximum number of jobs\r\n(1 to 1000).foreach { _ => sc.parallelize(List(1)).collect }\r\n\r\n// Confirm the maximum number of stages\r\nvar df = sc.parallelize(1 to 2)\r\n(1 to 1000).foreach { i =>  df = df.repartition(i % 5 + 1) }\r\ndf.collect\r\n\r\n\r\n// Confirm the maximum number of executors\r\n(1 to 300).foreach { _ => try sc.parallelize(List(1)).foreach { _ => System.exit(0) } catch { case e => }}\r\n```\r\n\r\nScreenshots

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFix the behavior of IsolatedClientLoader to load system classes first. IsolatedClientLoader is used to load HMS client classes to provide isolation of HMS classes. For non-shared classes, IsolatedClientLoader will load from execJars list. The list comes either from maven pom file (spark.sql.hive.metastore.jars=maven), or figure out from the context classloader (spark.sql.hive.metastore.jars=builtin). In the later case, Spark should resolve classes in the same order of other (non-HMS) classes. That is, if spark.driver.userClassPathFirst=true, search user path first then system path. Otherwise, system path first then user path. HiveUtils.allJars aim to compose an ordered list of jars representing the resolution order of either childFirst or urlClassLoader. In case of urlClassLoader, the normal behavior is urlClassLoader would delegate to parent to resolve the class first (system path), if fail then resolve use it's own path (user path). However, current code list the user jars (urlClassLoader.getURLs) in front of system jars (allJars(urlClassLoader.getParent)), which reverse the order.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nBy convention, Spark shall use system jars first unless spark.driver.userClassPathFirst is defined. There's no reason the break the contract when loading HMS client jar using IsolatedClientLoader.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit test added in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR proposes to add a new built-in function `mask` a data masking function which Hive already supports.\r\n\r\nActually, Hive supports 6 data masking functions.\r\nI'll implement all of them but I'd like to introduce the most basic one in this PR.\r\n\r\n`mask` in this PR is implemented to be compatible with the Hive's implementation.\r\nIn Hive, there is a [document}(https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+UDF#LanguageManualUDF-DataMaskingFunctions) for data masking functions but it seems outdated so I referred to the Hive's source code.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/hive/blob/rel/release-2.3.8/ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/udf/generic/GenericUDFMask.java\r\n\r\nActually, Hive's data masking functions can be applied to not only characters but also numeric types and date type.\r\nIn this PR, `mask` supports only `StringType` but I'll extends it for other types. So, this new function is categolized as a new group `data_masking_funcs` rather than `string_funcs`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFor data masking, `mask` is more useful than `replace` or `translate`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. Users can use the new built-in function.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nNew

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe UnsupportedOperationChecker shouldn't allow streaming-batch intersects. As described in the ticket, they can't actually be planned correctly, and even simple cases like the below will fail:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  test(\"intersect\") {\r\n    val input = MemoryStream[Long]\r\n    val df = input.toDS().intersect(spark.range(10).as[Long])\r\n    testStream(df) (\r\n      AddData(input, 1L),\r\n      CheckAnswer(1)\r\n    )\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nUsers will be confused by the cryptic errors produced from trying to run an invalid query plan.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nSome queries which previously failed with a poor error will now fail with a better one.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nmodified unit

For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n`CheckpointFileManager` is designed to handle checkpoint file manipulation. However, there are a few places exposing `FileSystem` from checkpoint files/paths. We should use `CheckpointFileManager` to manipulate checkpoint files. For example, we may want to have one storage system for checkpoint file. If all checkpoint file manipulation is performed through `CheckpointFileManager`, we can only implement `CheckpointFileManager` for the storage system, and don't need to implement `FileSystem` API for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR proposes to make `CREATE FUNCTION USING` syntax can take archives as resources.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIt would be useful.\r\n`CREATE FUNCTION USING` syntax doesn't support archives as resources because archives were not supported in Spark SQL.\r\nNow Spark SQL supports archives so I think we can support them for the syntax.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. Users can specify archives for `CREATE FUNCTION USING` syntax.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nNew test.","created_at":"2021-04-27T05:03:03Z","updated_at":"2021-04-28T01:15:30Z","closed_at":"2021-04-28T01:15:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7a185ff88296ace6bb6b8f9b80fcdd2ae670916c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32359/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32359/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/32359/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a6b9f1ae9e564e1c8c07c8987de6de0ca5f728cd","head":{"label":"sarutak:load-function-using-archive","ref":"load-function-using-archive","sha":"a6b9f1ae9e564e1c8c07c8987de6de0ca5f728cd","user":{"login":"sarutak","id":4736016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak","html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19300892,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTMwMDg5Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"sarutak/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sarutak","id":4736016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak","html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nPrint warning msg if join hint is not supported for the specified build side.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently we support specify the join implementation with hint, but Spark did not promise it.\r\n\r\nFor example broadcast outer join and hash outer join we need to check if its build side was supported. And at least we should print some warning log instead of changing to other join implementation silently.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, warning log might be printed.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nRetain column metadata during the process of nested column pruning, when constructing `StructField`. \r\n\r\nTo test the above change, this also added the logic of column projection in `InMemoryTable`. Without the fix `DSV2CharVarcharDDLTestSuite` will fail.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe column metadata is used in a few places such as re-constructing CHAR/VARCHAR information such as in [SPARK-33901](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-33901). Therefore, we should retain the info during nested column pruning.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis change is to use repos.spark-packages.org instead of Bintray as the repository service for spark-packages.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe change is needed because Bintray will no longer be available from May 1st.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nThis should be transparent for users who use SparkSubmit.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTested running spark-shell with --packages
