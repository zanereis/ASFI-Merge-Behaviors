What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nChange `InterpretedUnsafeProjection#getElementSize` to choose the appropriate element size for the underlying SQL type of a UDT, rather than simply using the the default size of the underlying SQL type.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nConsider this query:\r\n```\r\n// create a file of vector data\r\nimport org.apache.spark.ml.linalg.{DenseVector, Vector}\r\n\r\ncase class TestRow(varr: Array[Vector])\r\nval values = Array(0.1d, 0.2d, 0.3d)\r\nval dv = new DenseVector(values).asInstanceOf[Vector]\r\n\r\nval ds = Seq(TestRow(Array(dv, dv))).toDS\r\nds.coalesce(1).write.mode(\"overwrite\").format(\"parquet\").save(\"vector_data\")\r\n\r\n// this works\r\nspark.read.format(\"parquet\").load(\"vector_data\").collect\r\n\r\nsql(\"set spark.sql.codegen.wholeStage=false\")\r\nsql(\"set spark.sql.codegen.factoryMode=NO_CODEGEN\")\r\n\r\n// this will get an error\r\nspark.read.format(\"parquet\").load(\"vector_data\").collect\r\n```\r\nThe failures vary, incuding\r\n* `VectorUDT` attempting to deserialize to a `SparseVector` (rather than a `DenseVector`)\r\n* negative array size (for one of the nested arrays)\r\n* JVM crash (SIGBUS error).\r\n\r\nThis is because `InterpretedUnsafeProjection` initializes the outer-most array writer with an element size of 17 (the size of the UDT's underlying struct), rather than an element size of 8, which would be appropriate for an array of structs.\r\n\r\nWhen the outer-most array is later accessed, `UnsafeArrayData` assumes an element size of 8, so it picks up a garbage offset/size tuple for the second element.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit test.\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-02T23:56:06Z","updated_at":"2023-05-12T21:32:27Z","closed_at":"2023-01-03T01:22:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"25a7f1157608ade4f9ccdb81e7e4c566a4c6d8ed","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39349/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39349/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/39349/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1df5bc59a3b96f10cc4aa49b33abc6f880acd3c7","head":{"label":"bersprockets:udt_issue","ref":"udt_issue","sha":"1df5bc59a3b96f10cc4aa49b33abc6f880acd3c7","user":{"login":"bersprockets","id":21131848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTMxODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21131848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets","html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":115567071,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTU1NjcwNzE=","name":"spark","full_name":"bersprockets/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bersprockets","id":21131848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTMxODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21131848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets","html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to support to infer field names when the input data is the list of dictionaries in `SparkSession.createDataFrame`.\r\n\r\nFor example,\r\n\r\n```python\r\nspark.createDataFrame([{\"course\": \"dotNET\", \"earnings\": 10000, \"year\": 2012}]).show()\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Before**:\r\n\r\n```\r\n+------+-----+----+\r\n|    _1|   _2|  _3|\r\n+------+-----+----+\r\n|dotNET|10000|2012|\r\n+------+-----+----+\r\n```\r\n\r\n**After**:\r\n\r\n```\r\n+------+--------+----+\r\n|course|earnings|year|\r\n+------+--------+----+\r\n|dotNET|   10000|2012|\r\n+------+--------+----+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo match the behaviour with the regular PySpark.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo to end users because Spark Connect has not been released.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnittest was

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nNot close FileSystem instances when log out a sts session. The FileSystem instances will remain in FileSystem#CACHE, and the total size should be on the same order of magnitude as all usernames once connected, so the total memory consumption should be acceptable.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently when enabled impersonation, Spark Thriftserver will close filesystem instance for the user logged in when logout. If there are two sessions with the same user, the remaining session will become corrupted.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTested in dev and production

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUse DSv2 AppendData.byName for INSERT INTO by name instead of reordering and converting to AppendData.byOrdinal\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently for INSERT INTO by name we reorder the value list and convert it to INSERT INTO by ordinal. Since DSv2 logical nodes have the `isByName` flag we don't need to do this. The current approach is limiting in that\r\n\r\n- Users must provide the full list of table columns (this limits the functionality for features like generated columns see [SPARK-41290](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-41290))\r\n- It allows ambiguous queries such as `INSERT OVERWRITE t PARTITION (c='1') (c) VALUES ('2')` where the user provides both the static partition column 'c' and the column 'c' in the column list. We should check that the static partition column is not in the column list. See the added test for more detailed example.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nFor versions 3.3 and below:\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE t(i STRING, c string) USING PARQUET PARTITIONED BY (c);\r\nINSERT OVERWRITE t PARTITION (c='1') (c) VALUES ('2')\r\nSELECT * FROM t\r\n```\r\n```\r\n+---+---+\r\n|  i|  c|\r\n+---+---+\r\n|  2|  1|\r\n+---+---+\r\n```\r\nFor versions 3.4 and above:\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE t(i STRING, c string) USING PARQUET PARTITIONED BY (c);\r\nINSERT OVERWRITE t PARTITION (c='1') (c) VALUES ('2')\r\n```\r\n```\r\nAnalysisException: [STATIC_PARTITION_COLUMN_IN_COLUMN_LIST] Static partition column c is also specified in the column list.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests are added.\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-01T23:16:02Z","updated_at":"2023-01-06T02:42:30Z","closed_at":"2023-01-06T02:42:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f1e4346b8eb3a4f1e8dad8bea26acfb529c0a233","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39334/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39334/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/39334/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/419b41f63ca9a42c1bc4551d5f053b9bebac7d0d","head":{"label":"allisonport-db:insert-into-by-name","ref":"insert-into-by-name","sha":"419b41f63ca9a42c1bc4551d5f053b9bebac7d0d","user":{"login":"allisonport-db","id":89107911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MTA3OTEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89107911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonport-db","html_url":"https://github.com/allisonport-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonport-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonport-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonport-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonport-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonport-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonport-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonport-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonport-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonport-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":515435375,"node_id":"R_kgDOHrjrbw","name":"spark","full_name":"allisonport-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"allisonport-db","id":89107911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MTA3OTEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89107911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonport-db","html_url":"https://github.com/allisonport-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonport-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonport-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonport-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonport-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonport-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonport-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonport-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonport-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonport-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/allisonport-db/spark","description":"Apache

request?\r\n\r\nFor complex expressions in window spec definition, we extract it and replace it with an AttributeReference (with an internal column name, e.g. \"_w0\").\r\nWe can reuse the extracted expressions to avoid generator unnecessary Window node.\r\n\r\nFor example, query:\r\n```\r\nSELECT max(value) over(partition by (key) order by cast(ts as timestamp)) as w1,\r\n       min(value) over(partition by (key) order by cast(ts as timestamp)) as w2\r\nFROM t1\r\n```\r\n\r\nbefore this PR:\r\n```\r\nProject [w1#229L, w2#230L]\r\n+- Project [value#232L, key#231L, _w2#236, _w3#237,

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to change auto-generation of column aliases (the case when an user doesn't assign any alias explicitly). Before the changes, Spark SQL generates such alias from `Expression` but this PR proposes to take the parse tree (output of lexer), and generate an alias using the term tokens from the tree.\r\n\r\nNew helper function `ParserUtils.toExprAlias` takes a `ParseTree` from `Antlr4`, and converts it to a `String` using following simple rules:\r\n1. Adds a gap after every terminal node (`TerminalNodeImpl`) except of `(<[.`\r\n2. Removes a gap before `(), <>, []` and `,.` \r\n\r\nFor example, the sequence of tokens \"(\", \"columnA\", \"+\", \"1\", \")\" is converted to the alias \"(columnA + 1)\"\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo improve user experience with Spark SQL. It is always best practice to name the result of any expressions in a queries select list,  if one plans to reference them later. This yields the most readable results and stability. However, sometimes queries are generated or we’re just lazy and trust in the auto generated names. The problem is that the auto-generated names are produced by pretty printing the expression tree which is, while “generally” readable, not meant to be stable across long durations of time. For example:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> DESC SELECT substring('hello', 5);\r\nsubstring(hello, 5, 2147483647)\tstring\r\n```\r\nthe auto-generated column alias `substring(hello, 5, 2147483647)` contains not-obvious elements.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the modified test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *DDLParserSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly *SparkThriftServerProtocolVersionsSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *AvroV2Suite\"\r\n$ build/sbt

\"test:testOnly *DatasetSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *InsertSuite\"\r\n```\r\nand run TPCDS benchmarks on regenerated golden files:\r\n```\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/databricks/tpcds-kit.git\r\n$ cd tpcds-kit/tools\r\n$ make OS=MACOS\r\n$ cd $SPARK_HOME\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/Test/runMain org.apache.spark.sql.GenTPCDSData --dsdgenDir `pwd`/../tpcds-kit/tools --location `pwd`/tpcds-sf-1 --scaleFactor 1 --numPartitions 1 --overwrite\"\r\n```\r\nand re-gen golden files:\r\n```\r\n$ SPARK_TPCDS_DATA=`pwd`/tpcds-sf-1 SPARK_GENERATE_GOLDEN_FILES=1 build/sbt \"sql/testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.TPCDSQueryTestSuite\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd regenerate the SQL golden files by:\r\n```\r\n$ SPARK_GENERATE_GOLDEN_FILES=1

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr aims upgrade Apache httpcore from 4.4.14 to 4.4.16.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe new version bring some bugs fix:\r\n\r\n- HTTPCORE-695: Unhandled CancelledKeyException during processPendingInterestOps leads to a shutdown of the underlying IOReactor.\r\n- HTTPCORE-687: Non-blocking SSL I/O session can enter a tight loop if the SSL session gets closed by the protocol layer while there is still unprocessed data stuck in the protocol session buffer.\r\n- HTTPCORE-660: Convert RuntimeExceptions thrown by SSLSetupHandler#verify to SSLExceptions.\r\n- HTTPCORE-730: Non-blocking SSL I/O session incorrectly sets read interest when the session is being closed even if the application layer has cleared interest in input causing a busy loop in the I/O event loop and excessive CPU utilization.\r\n- HTTPCORE-720: Discard any remaining decrypted application data after the TLS session has been closed by the local endpoint.\r\n- HTTPCORE-716: Evict remaining decrypted input data from SSL I/O session buffers upon session closure.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWe'll get wrong data when transform only specify reader or writer 's row format delimited, the reason is using the wrong format to feed/fetch data to/from running script now. we should set the format correctly.\r\n\r\nCurrently in Spark:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> CREATE TABLE t1 (a string, b string); \r\n\r\nspark-sql> INSERT OVERWRITE t1 VALUES(\"1\", \"2\"), (\"3\", \"4\");\r\n\r\nspark-sql> SELECT TRANSFORM(a, b)\r\n         >   ROW FORMAT DELIMITED\r\n         >   FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','\r\n         >   USING 'cat'\r\n         >   AS (c)\r\n         > FROM t1;\r\nc\r\n\r\nspark-sql> SELECT TRANSFORM(a, b)\r\n         >   USING 'cat'\r\n         >   AS (c)\r\n         >   ROW FORMAT DELIMITED\r\n         >   FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','\r\n         > FROM t1;\r\nc\r\n1    23    4\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe same sql in hive:\r\n```sql\r\nhive> SELECT TRANSFORM(a, b)\r\n    >   ROW FORMAT DELIMITED\r\n    >   FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','\r\n    >   USING 'cat'\r\n    >   AS (c)\r\n    > FROM t1;\r\nc\r\n1,2\r\n3,4\r\n\r\nhive> SELECT TRANSFORM(a, b)\r\n    >   USING 'cat'\r\n    >   AS (c)\r\n    >   ROW FORMAT DELIMITED\r\n    >   FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','\r\n    > FROM t1;\r\nc\r\n1    2\r\n3    4\r\n```\r\n \r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFix transform writer format and reader format.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nWhen we set transform's row format delimited in the sql, we may get the wrong data.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThere are two types of file source Metadata columns in Spark\r\n* Metadata column that is constant per file (file_name, file_size, ...)\r\n* Metadata column that is not constant (currently only row_index)\r\n\r\nThe two types are generated differently\r\n* File constant metadata column is appended to the output after scan\r\n* non-constant metadata column is generated during the scan\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces two new types: FileSourceConstantMetadataAttribute and FileSourceGeneratedMetadataAttribute. They are both subtypes of FileSourceMetadata attribute and are used to clearly distinguish the attributes.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nAdding new metadata attributes requires changes in multiple places at the moment and it is not always clear in which place which attributes are affected / to be used.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNo change in behaviour is expected so new tests were

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/38969 to fix a regression.\r\n\r\nSQL UI is not the only way for end users to see the SQL metrics. They can also access the accumulator values in the physical plan programmatically via query execution listener. We should be consistent with the SQL UI and not expose the -1 value.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

After this patch, the workflow looks like this:\r\n* setup pre-resources (including PVCs) before Pod creation\r\n* create Pod\r\n* refresh all pre-resources' owner references as created Pod\r\n* make the created Pod an owner of other resources and create them\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThese pre-resources are usually necessary in Pod creation and scheduling, they should be ready before Pod creation, should be deleted when user delete Pod, the lifecycle of these resource is same with Pod.   \r\n\r\nIf PVCs are created after Pod creation, we will have warning event in Pod as follow:  \r\n```plain\r\nerror getting PVC \"spark/application-exec-1-pvc-0\": could not find v1.PersistentVolumeClaim \"spark/application-exec-1-pvc-0\" \r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds an extension mechanism to the Spark Connect protocol to support custom Relation and Expression types. This is necessary to support custom extensions in Spark like Delta or custom plugins in Catalyst.\r\n\r\nThis is achieved by adding `protobuf.Any` fields in `Relation`, `Command`, and `Expression`. To load the extension, this PR adds two configuration flags to indicate which classes should be loaded.\r\n\r\n  * `spark.connect.extensions.relation.classes`\r\n  * `spark.connect.extensions.expression.classes`\n  * `spark.connect.extensions.command.classes`\r\n\r\nTo add a new plugin, the consumers have to implement either `RelationPlugin`, `CommandPlugin`,  or `ExpressionPlugin` and implement the corresponding `transform()` method. If the plugin does not support the transformation of the input, they plugin must return `None`.\r\n\r\nBelow is a simplified example of an expression and relation plugin.\r\n\r\nFirst, define the custom message type that are necessary for the particular input.\r\n\r\n```proto\r\nmessage ExamplePluginRelation {\r\n  Relation input = 1;\r\n  string custom_field = 2;\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\nmessage ExamplePluginExpression {\r\n  Expression child = 1;\r\n  string custom_field = 2;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSecond, define the necessary `RelationPlugin` and `ExpressionPlugin` implementations.\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nclass ExampleRelationPlugin extends RelationPlugin {\r\n  override def transform(\r\n      relation: protobuf.Any,\r\n      planner: SparkConnectPlanner): Option[LogicalPlan] = {\r\n\r\n    if (!relation.is(classOf[proto.ExamplePluginRelation])) {\r\n      return None\r\n    }\r\n    val plugin = relation.unpack(classOf[proto.ExamplePluginRelation])\r\n    Some(planner.transformRelation(plugin.getInput))\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass ExampleExpressionPlugin extends ExpressionPlugin {\r\n  override def transform(\r\n      relation: protobuf.Any,\r\n      planner: SparkConnectPlanner): Option[Expression] = {\r\n    if (!relation.is(classOf[proto.ExamplePluginExpression])) {\r\n      return None\r\n    }\r\n    val exp = relation.unpack(classOf[proto.ExamplePluginExpression])\r\n    Some(\r\n      Alias(planner.transformExpression(exp.getChild), exp.getCustomField)(explicitMetadata =\r\n        None))\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, on the client side, the new extensions simply have to be encoded into the `protobuf.Any` value to be available once the the plugins are loaded. Below is an example for wrapping the custom message type into a standard `Relation` with a `Range` child.\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nRelation\r\n  .newBuilder()\r\n  .setExtension(\r\n    protobuf.Any.pack(\r\n      proto.ExamplePluginRelation\r\n        .newBuilder()\r\n        .setInput(\r\n          proto.Relation\r\n            .newBuilder()\r\n            .setRange(proto.Range\r\n              .newBuilder()\r\n              .setStart(0)\r\n              .setEnd(10)\r\n              .setStep(1)))\r\n        .build()))\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen the plan is transformed the custom extensions will behave like any other built-in functionality of Spark.\r\n\r\nFor an end-to-end example the code in `SparkConnectPluginRegistrySuite` provides a full working example.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nExtensibility\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, adds a new extension mechanism to the Spark Connect protoocol.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded test coverage for the plugin registry, and end to end transformation and execution.","created_at":"2022-12-29T16:04:46Z","updated_at":"2023-08-28T13:43:41Z","closed_at":"2022-12-30T09:11:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bd77358f965ff40b7ce6eeb9e850b3ca9a6cdfb2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39291/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39291/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/39291/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/28a955458cf95435323923da809f83be5d0cbd48","head":{"label":"grundprinzip:SPARK-41629","ref":"SPARK-41629","sha":"28a955458cf95435323923da809f83be5d0cbd48","user":{"login":"grundprinzip","id":3421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip","html_url":"https://github.com/grundprinzip","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":503900825,"node_id":"R_kgDOHgjqmQ","name":"spark","full_name":"grundprinzip/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"grundprinzip","id":3421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip","html_url":"https://github.com/grundprinzip","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/grundprinzip/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to support Spark Connect's Window in `pyspark.sql.window` namespace.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/39041 implemented the base, and https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/39149 implemented Spark Connect's Window.\r\n\r\nThis PR connects them.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo provide the users the same usage, see also https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/39041.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, see also https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/39041.\r\nSpark Connect can use Window functions via the same namespace `pyspark.sql.window`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually checked the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nHandle decommission request sent before executor registration. When decom request is triggered from worker, executor should be decommissioned and not accept new tasks, but if scheduler backend got decom request before executor registration, the executor won't be decommissioned. So cache the unknown executors and resent decommission request after executor registration.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrent behavior is such requests will be ignored\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded test in CoarseGrainedSchedulerBackendSuite\r\n","created_at":"2022-12-29T05:24:22Z","updated_at":"2023-05-01T22:04:02Z","closed_at":"2023-05-01T22:03:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2dc2e007158607948559247e8c1c355cab141a43","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39280/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39280/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/39280/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/fc4eb7f578f9c37c98b8dd3c1522a33064a65f47","head":{"label":"warrenzhu25:decom-missing","ref":"decom-missing","sha":"fc4eb7f578f9c37c98b8dd3c1522a33064a65f47","user":{"login":"warrenzhu25","id":1633312,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzMzMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1633312?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25","html_url":"https://github.com/warrenzhu25","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":217627454,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTc2Mjc0NTQ=","name":"spark","full_name":"warrenzhu25/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"warrenzhu25","id":1633312,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzMzMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1633312?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25","html_url":"https://github.com/warrenzhu25","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/warrenzhu25/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nFix two issues in implicit lateral column alias resolution of Aggregate; added related test cases.\r\n* The check condition whether to lift up in Aggregate is incorrect. Leaf expressions, e.g. `now()` will fail the check and won't be lift up. Changed to follow the code pattern in checkAnalysis.\r\n* Another condition that requires the new Aggregate expressions to be non-empty to lift up in Aggregate is unnecessary. Think about the Aggregate on expressions without any grouping expressions or aggregate expressions, e.g. `select 1 as a, a + 1 .. group by ..`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFix the bug mentioned above.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nNew

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR proposes to group all sub-executions together in SQL UI if they belong to the same root execution.\r\n\r\nThis feature is controlled by conf `spark.ui.sql.groupSubExecutionEnabled` and the default value is set to `true`\r\n\r\nWe can have some follow-up improvements after this PR:\r\n1. Add links to SQL page and Job page to indicate the root execution ID.\r\n2. Better handling for the root execution missing case (e.g. eviction due to retaining limit). In this PR, the sub-executions will be displayed ungrouped.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nbetter user experience.\r\n\r\nIn PR #39220, the CTAS query will trigger a sub-execution to perform the data insertion. But the current UI will display the two executions separately which may confuse the users.\r\nIn addition, this change should also help the structured streaming cases\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, the screenshot of the UI change is shown below\r\nSQL Query:\r\n```\r\nCREATE TABLE t USING PARQUET AS SELECT 'a' as a, 1 as b\r\n```\r\nUI before this

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis pr removes `OptimizedCreateHiveTableAsSelectCommand` and move the code that tune `InsertIntoHiveTable` to `InsertIntoHadoopFsRelationCommand` into `RelationConversions`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCTAS use a nested execution to do data writing, so it is unnecessary to have `OptimizedCreateHiveTableAsSelectCommand`. The inside `InsertIntoHiveTable` would be converted to `InsertIntoHadoopFsRelationCommand` if possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nfix

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR mixes the client ID into the cache for the SparkSessions on the server. This is necessary to allow to concurrent SparkSessions of the same user to run without interfering. \r\n\r\nThe client ID was added to be used in that way, but until now the functionality was not implemented.\r\n\r\nOn the client side, the Python client now validates that the result received is actually from the same session.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nStability\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNO\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting
