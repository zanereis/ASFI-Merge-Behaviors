If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nFor query with multiple stream-stream joins, unnecessary shuffle can be happened as we don't reorder join keys for stream-stream join. We already reorder join keys for shuffled hash join and sort merge join, so we can also have it for stream-stream join - https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/exchange/EnsureRequirements.scala#L232 .\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAvoid unnecessary shuffle for query.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdded test in `StreamingJoinSuite.scala`.","created_at":"2021-06-09T05:36:59Z","updated_at":"2021-06-09T09:26:11Z","closed_at":"2021-06-09T07:35:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6a91d772cceb0f9e9b9ba28d05c01407f208592f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAs described in  #32831, Spark has compatible issues when querying a view created by an\r\nolder version. The root cause is that Spark changed the auto-generated alias name. To avoid\r\nthis in the future, we could ask the user to specify explicit column names when creating\r\na view.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAvoid compatible issue when querying a view\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIf the user creates a view in 2.4 and reads it in 3.1/3.2, there will be an incompatible schema issue.\r\nSo this PR adds a view ddl in the error message to prompt the user recreating the view to fix the\r\nincompatible issue.\r\nFor example:\r\n```sql\r\n-- create view in 2.4\r\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS t USING parquet AS SELECT '1' as a, '20210420' as b\"\r\nCREATE OR REPLACE VIEW v AS SELECT CAST(t.a AS INT), to_date(t.b, 'yyyyMMdd') FROM t\r\n-- select view in master\r\nSELECT * FROM v\r\n```\r\nThen we will get below error:\r\n```\r\ncannot resolve '`to_date(spark_catalog.default.t.b, 'yyyyMMdd')`' given input columns: [a, to_date(b, yyyyMMdd)];\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nImprove the error message\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, the error message will change\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nnewly added test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSeems like the new MyPy version was released (0.901) and it broke the CI: https://github.com/python/mypy/releases.\r\n\r\n```\r\npython/pyspark/pandas/indexes/base.py:2007: error: Argument 1 to \"from_tuples\" of \"MultiIndex\" has incompatible type \"Index\"; expected \"List[Tuple[Any, ...]]\"\r\npython/pyspark/testing/pandasutils.py:41: error: Library stubs not installed for \"tabulate\" (or incompatible with Python 3.6)\r\npython/pyspark/testing/pandasutils.py:41: note: Hint: \"python3 -m pip install types-tabulate\"\r\npython/pyspark/testing/pandasutils.py:41: note: (or run \"mypy --install-types\" to install all missing stub packages)\r\npython/pyspark/testing/pandasutils.py:41: note: See https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/running_mypy.html#missing-imports\r\nFound 2 errors in 2 files (checked 312 source files)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI tried to fix these instances and pin it to the latest version (0.901). However, I realised that `python/pyspark/pandas/indexes/base.py:2007` has a logic issue (see https://github.com/databricks/koalas/pull/1325#discussion_r647889901 and https://github.com/databricks/koalas/pull/1325#discussion_r647890007) which cannot be fixed quickly.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I decided to pin it to the previous version we used before for now, in order to unblock other PRs builds.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo unblock other PRs.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, dev-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI tested in my local but it has to be tested and passed in GitHub Actions in this

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR aims to upgrade `zstd-jni` to 1.5.0-2, which uses `zstd` version 1.5.0.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nMajor improvements to Zstd support are targeted for the upcoming 3.2.0 release of Spark. Zstd 1.5.0 introduces significant compression (+25% to 140%) and decompression (~15%) speed improvements in benchmarks described in more detail on the releases page:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/facebook/zstd/releases/tag/v1.5.0\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBuild passes build tests, but the benchmark tests seem flaky. I am unsure if this change is responsible.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch removes the usage of putting null into StateStore. This is backport of #32796 to branch-3.0.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAccording to `get` method doc in `StateStore` API, it returns non-null row if the key exists. So basically we should avoid write null to `StateStore`. You cannot distinguish if the returned null row is because the key doesn't exist, or the value is actually null. And due to the defined behavior of `get`, it is quite easy to cause NPE error if the caller doesn't expect to get a null if the caller believes the key exists.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n- Introduce a DecimalOps for DecimalType\r\n- Make `isnull` method data-type-based\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nNow DecimalType, DoubleType, and FloatType data share the FractionalOps class, but DecimalType behaves differently from FloatType and DoubleType (as https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/python/pyspark/pandas/base.py#L987-L990), so we propose to introduce DecimalOps. The behavior difference here is caused by DecimalType could not have NaN.\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-35342\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing

Within an application，Spark tactfully use them to request executors from cluster manager according to the real-time workload. Once set, the range is fixed through the whole application lifecycle. This is not very convenient for long-running application when the range should be changeable for some cases, such as:\r\n1. the cluster manager itself or the queue will scale up and down, which looks very likely to happen in modern cloud platforms\r\n2. the application is long-running, but the timeliness, priority, e.t.c are not only determined by the workload of the application, but also by the traffic across the cluster manager or just different moments\r\n3. e.t.c.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n- move the rule `OptimizeSkewedJoin` from stage optimization phase to stage preparation phase.\r\n- run the rule `EnsureRequirements` one more time after the `OptimizeSkewedJoin` rule in the stage preparation phase.\r\n- add `SkewJoinAwareCost` to support estimate skewed join cost\r\n- add new config to decide if force optimize skewed join\r\n- in `OptimizeSkewedJoin`, we generate 2 physical plans, one with skew join optimization and one without. Then we use the cost evaluator w.r.t. the force-skew-join flag and pick the plan with lower cost.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIn general, skewed join has more impact on performance  than once more shuffle. It makes sense to force optimize skewed join even if introduce extra shuffle.\r\n\r\nA common case:\r\n```\r\nHashAggregate\r\n  SortMergJoin\r\n    Sort\r\n      Exchange\r\n    Sort\r\n      Exchange\r\n```\r\nand after this PR, the plan looks like:\r\n```\r\nHashAggregate\r\n  Exchange\r\n    SortMergJoin (isSkew=true)\r\n      Sort\r\n        Exchange\r\n      Sort\r\n        Exchange\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that, the new introduced shuffle also can be optimized by AQE.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, a new config.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n* Add new test\r\n* pass exists test `SPARK-30524: Do not optimize skew join if introduce additional shuffle`\r\n* pass exists test

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIn the PR, I propose to extend Spark SQL API to accept `java.time.LocalDateTime` as an external type of recently added new Catalyst type - `TimestampWithoutTZ`. The Java class `java.time.LocalDateTime` has a similar semantic to ANSI SQL timestamp without timezone type, and it is the most suitable to be an external type for `TimestampWithoutTZType`. In more details:\r\n\r\n* Added `TimestampWithoutTZConverter` which converts java.time.LocalDateTime instances to/from internal representation of the Catalyst type `TimestampWithoutTZType` (to Long type). The `TimestampWithoutTZConverter` object uses new methods of DateTimeUtils:\r\n  * localDateTimeToMicros() converts the input date time to the total length in microseconds. \r\n  * microsToLocalDateTime() obtains a java.time.LocalDateTime \r\n* Support new type `TimestampWithoutTZType` in RowEncoder via the methods createDeserializerForLocalDateTime() and createSerializerForLocalDateTime().\r\n* Extended the Literal API to construct literals from `java.time.LocalDateTime` instances.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo allow users parallelization of `java.time.LocalDateTime` collections, and construct timestamp without time zone columns. Also to collect such columns back to the driver side.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nThe PR extends existing functionality. So, users can parallelize instances of the java.time.LocalDateTime class and collect them back.\r\n```\r\nscala> val ds = Seq(java.time.LocalDateTime.parse(\"1970-01-01T00:00:00\")).toDS\r\nds: org.apache.spark.sql.Dataset[java.time.LocalDateTime] = [value: timestampwithouttz]\r\n\r\nscala> ds.collect()\r\nres0: Array[java.time.LocalDateTime] = Array(1970-01-01T00:00)\r\n```\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR adds a parameter to enable/disable a featuer where LearningNodes are merged after a RF model is trained.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n2 Reasons:\r\n\r\n1. In addition to basic classification, another use case for decision trees are the probabilities associated with predictions. \r\n Once pruned, these predictions are lost and it makes the trees/predictions challenging to work with if not unusable.\r\n\r\n2. It is not in line with the default behavior in sklearn.  In sklearn, the trees are left unpruned by default.\r\n\r\nPlease see Jira ticket for more explanation.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, it adds a parameter that is exposed to the Tree based classifiers.  Will add tests here to ensure parameter is exposed correctly.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nI modified the two tests introduced with this change to verify postive/negative use of feature.  I also added assertions for default behavior\r\n\r\nWill add tests that ensure user exposed API is validated.\r\n\r\nLocally ran `./build/mvn -pl mllib package` and verified tests passed\r\nAdditionally, running through git workflow as described here:\r\n

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis adds support in the ESS to serve merged shuffle block meta and data requests to executors.\r\nThis change is needed for fetching remote merged shuffle data from the remote shuffle services. This is part of push-based shuffle SPIP [SPARK-30602](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-30602).\r\n\r\nThis change introduces new messages between clients and the external shuffle service:\r\n\r\n1. `MergedBlockMetaRequest`: The client sends this to external shuffle to get the meta information for a merged block. The response to this is one of these :\r\n  - `MergedBlockMetaSuccess` : contains request id, number of chunks, and a `ManagedBuffer` which is a `FileSegmentBuffer` backed by the merged block meta file.\r\n  - `RpcFailure`: this is sent back to client in case of failure. This is an existing message.\r\n\r\n2. `FetchShuffleBlockChunks`: This is similar to `FetchShuffleBlocks` message but it is to fetch merged shuffle chunks instead of blocks.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThese changes are needed for push-based shuffle. Refer to the SPIP in [SPARK-30602](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-30602).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded unit tests.\r\nThe reference PR with the consolidated changes covering the complete implementation is also provided in [SPARK-30602](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-30602).\r\nWe have already verified the functionality and the improved performance as documented in the SPIP doc.\r\n\r\nLead-authored-by: Chandni Singh chsingh@linkedin.com\r\nCo-authored-by: Min Shen

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nRefactor the logic for constructing the user classpath from `yarn.ApplicationMaster` into `yarn.Client` so that it can be leveraged on the executor side as well, instead of having the driver construct it and pass it to the executor via command-line arguments. A new method, `getUserClassPath`, is added to `CoarseGrainedExecutorBackend` which defaults to `Nil` (consistent with the existing behavior where non-YARN resource managers do not configure the user classpath). `YarnCoarseGrainedExecutorBackend` overrides this to construct the user classpath from the existing `APP_JAR` and `SECONDARY_JARS` configs.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nUser-provided JARs are made available to executors using a custom classloader, so they do not appear on the standard Java classpath. Instead, they are passed as a list to the executor which then creates a classloader out of the URLs. Currently in the case of YARN, this list of JARs is crafted by the Driver (in `ExecutorRunnable`), which then passes the information to the executors (`CoarseGrainedExecutorBackend`) by specifying each JAR on the executor command line as `--user-class-path /path/to/myjar.jar`. This can cause extremely long argument lists when there are many JARs, which can cause the OS argument length to be exceeded, typically manifesting as the error message:\r\n\r\n> /bin/bash: Argument list too long\r\n\r\nA [Google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=spark%20%22%2Fbin%2Fbash%3A%20argument%20list%20too%20long%22&oq=spark%20%22%2Fbin%2Fbash%3A%20argument%20list%20too%20long%22) indicates that this is not a theoretical problem and afflicts real users, including ours. Passing this list using the configurations instead resolves this issue.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, except for fixing the bug, allowing for larger JAR lists to be passed successfully. Configuration of JARs is identical to before.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew unit tests were added in `YarnClusterSuite`. Also, we have been running a similar fix internally for 4 months with great

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nWhen performing a PCA, the covariance matrix is calculate first.\r\nIn the function RowMAtrix.computeCovariance() there is the following code:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    if (rows.first().isInstanceOf[DenseVector]) {\r\n      computeDenseVectorCovariance(mean, n, m)\r\n    } else {\r\n      computeSparseVectorCovariance(mean, n, m)\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nAs can be seen, there are two different function to compute the covariance matrix depending on whether the matrix is sparse or dense. Now, the decision if the matrix is sparse or dense is based only on the type of the first row (DenseVector or SparseVector).\r\n\r\nI propose to calculate the **sparsity** of the matrix, as the ratio between number-of-zeros and total-number-of elements. And use the sparsity to switch between the two functions.\r\n\r\nIn later pull request #32734 the code checks that all rows are SparseVector, if all rows are sparse it uses the sparse covariance computation. \r\nStill, I would prefer to have the switch based on the actual sparsity of the matrix, rather than on its implementation. To notice you can have 2 matrices, with same elements and same number of zeros, implemented with SparseVector or DenseVector.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nHave more consistent results. With my implementation 2 matrices with same elements produce same results, independently if they are implemented using SparseVector or using DenseVector\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nI added 2 tests in the RowMatrixSuite.scala to verify that the sparsity is calculated properly.","created_at":"2021-06-07T15:17:33Z","updated_at":"2021-09-26T00:52:13Z","closed_at":"2021-09-26T00:52:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e51e5c22102ed4a96c821393b038d2f87f2d7af4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405803268,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAzMjY4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/MLLIB","name":"MLLIB","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32808/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32808/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/32808/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/04ce02382caafa7ac6450a53b6afe9d0bc2e14ab","head":{"label":"Antozamm:master","ref":"master","sha":"04ce02382caafa7ac6450a53b6afe9d0bc2e14ab","user":{"login":"Antozamm","id":20136929,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTM2OTI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20136929?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Antozamm","html_url":"https://github.com/Antozamm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Antozamm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Antozamm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Antozamm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Antozamm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Antozamm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Antozamm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Antozamm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Antozamm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Antozamm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":372157874,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzIxNTc4NzQ=","name":"spark","full_name":"Antozamm/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Antozamm","id":20136929,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTM2OTI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20136929?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Antozamm","html_url":"https://github.com/Antozamm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Antozamm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Antozamm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Antozamm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Antozamm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Antozamm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Antozamm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Antozamm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Antozamm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Antozamm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Antozamm/spark","description":"Apache

If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2.

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/31964\r\n\r\nWe should only quote the column name when nested column predicate pushdown is enabled, otherwise the data source side may not have the logic to parse the quoted column name and fail. This is not a problem before #31964 , as we don't quote the column name if there is no dot in the name. But #31964 changed it.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nnew

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch uses the \"concurrency\" syntax to replace the \"cancel job\" workflow:\r\n- .github/workflows/benchmark.yml\r\n- .github/workflows/labeler.yml\r\n- .github/workflows/notify_test_workflow.yml\r\n- .github/workflows/test_report.yml\r\n\r\nRemove the .github/workflows/cancel_duplicate_workflow_runs.yml\r\n\r\nNote that the push/schedule based job are not changed to keep the same config in https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/a4b70758d3dfe2d59fb3800321ffb2450206c26f:\r\n- .github/workflows/build_and_test.yml\r\n- .github/workflows/publish_snapshot.yml\r\n- .github/workflows/stale.yml\r\n- .github/workflows/update_build_status.yml\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe are using [cancel_duplicate_workflow_runs](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/a70e66ecfa638cacc99b4e9a7c464e41ec92ad30/.github/workflows/cancel_duplicate_workflow_runs.yml#L1) job to cancel previous jobs when a new job is queued. Now, it has been supported by the github action by using [\"concurrency\"](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#concurrency) syntax to make sure only a single job or workflow using the same concurrency group.\r\n\r\nRelated: https://github.com/apache/arrow/pull/10416 and https://github.com/potiuk/cancel-workflow-runs\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\ntriger the PR

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSupport YARN Placement Constraint, In this pr:\r\n\r\n- Add `LocalityPreferredSchedulingRequestContainerPlacementStrategy` for compute locality for SchedulingRequest\r\n- Add `ContainerImpl` for UT, since the interface Container's common API can't support `setAllocationRequestId` and `getAllocationRequestId`\r\n- Add `YarnSchedulingRequestAllocator ` as the implement of allocator when use Placement Constraint.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSpark can allow users to configure the Placement Constraint so that users will have more control on where the executors will get placed. For example:\r\n\r\n1. Spark job wants to be run on machines where Python version is x or Java version is y (Node Attributes)\r\n2. Spark job needs / does not need executors to be placed on machine where Hbase RegionServer / Zookeeper / Or any other Service is running. (Affinity / Anti Affinity)\r\n3. Spark job wants no more than 2 of it's executors on same node (Cardinality)\r\n4. Spark Job A executors wants / does not want to be run on where Spark Job / Any Other Job B containers runs (Application_Tag NameSpace)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nUse can set `spark.yarn.schedulingRequestEnabled` to use YARN placement constraint and set `spark.yarn.executor.nodeAttributes` to set constraint.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded UT and manuel tested this in yarn cluser:\r\n\r\n**set node attribute**\r\n```\r\n/usr/share/yarn-3/bin/yarn nodeattributes -attributestonodes -attributes attr1\r\nHostname Attribute-value  rm.yarn.io/attr1 :ip-xxxx              1\r\n\r\n/usr/share/yarn-3/bin/yarn nodeattributes -attributestonodes -attributes attr2\r\nHostname Attribute-value  rm.yarn.io/attr2 :ip-xxx\r\nspark command\r\n\r\nexport SPARK_CONF_DIR=/tmp/spark-conf-3.1.1\r\nexport SPARK_HOME=/tmp/spark-3.1.1\r\n/tmp/spark-3.1.1/bin/spark-sql --queue infra \\\r\n--executor-memory 1g

`ip-xxx`,\r\nif we set node attribute as `attr1=2`, we can't allocate any executor container.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-06-07T09:09:55Z","updated_at":"2023-08-17T08:49:13Z","closed_at":"2021-10-02T00:08:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"04338efa6aa2bcf5786cd675cb820461bf8613e4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1427970157,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDI3OTcwMTU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/YARN","name":"YARN","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32804/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32804/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/32804/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2cd9e69926a0900eec85d4424b9cdce919ba056c","head":{"label":"AngersZhuuuu:SPARK-26867","ref":"SPARK-26867","sha":"2cd9e69926a0900eec85d4424b9cdce919ba056c","user":{"login":"AngersZhuuuu","id":46485123,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NDg1MTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46485123?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu","html_url":"https://github.com/AngersZhuuuu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":176224753,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzYyMjQ3NTM=","name":"spark","full_name":"AngersZhuuuu/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AngersZhuuuu","id":46485123,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NDg1MTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46485123?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu","html_url":"https://github.com/AngersZhuuuu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AngersZhuuuu/spark","description":"Apache

For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nSpark SQL today supports the TIMESTAMP data type. However the semantics provided actually match TIMESTAMP WITH LOCAL TIMEZONE as defined by Oracle. Timestamps embedded in a SQL query or passed through JDBC are presumed to be in session local timezone and cast to UTC before being processed.\r\nThese are desirable semantics in many cases, such as when dealing with calendars.\r\nIn many (more) other cases, such as when dealing with log files it is desirable that the provided timestamps not be altered.\r\nSQL users expect that they can model either behavior and do so by using TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE for time zone insensitive data and TIMESTAMP WITH LOCAL TIME ZONE for time zone sensitive data.\r\nMost traditional RDBMS map TIMESTAMP to TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE and will be surprised to see TIMESTAMP WITH LOCAL TIME ZONE, a feature that does not exist in the standard.\r\n\r\nIn this new feature, we will introduce TIMESTAMP WITH LOCAL TIMEZONE to describe the existing timestamp type and add TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE for standard semantic.\r\nUsing these two types will provide clarity. \r\nThis is a starting PR. See more details in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-35662\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, a new data type for Timestamp without time zone type. It is still in development.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nUnit

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/32534\r\n\r\n#32534 proposed a use case to use `DeserializedMemoryEntry` to store off-heap data, and let Spark release the memory via the `AutoCloseable` interface. However, there is one more problem: `DeserializedMemoryEntry` always reports its size as on-heap size, which is inaccurate. If the Spark cluster is configured with small on-heap size and large off-heap size, this will trigger a lot of spilling.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes `DeserializedMemoryEntry` truly support off-heap data. Now the caller side can cache off-heap data with a new storage level `OFF_HEAP_ONLY_DESER`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\ncorrect the memory counting for off-heap data.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nupdated

package in PySpark in the end. So it has to be documented in the same level with other packages (e.g., Spark SQL).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, it changes the structure of the docs. To end users, no as it's only in development branch. \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested as

If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch removes the usage of putting null into StateStore.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAccording to `get` method doc in `StateStore` API, it returns non-null row if the key exists. So basically we should avoid write null to `StateStore`. You cannot distinguish if the returned null row is because the key doesn't exist, or the value is actually null. And due to the defined behavior of `get`, it is quite easy to cause NPE error if the caller doesn't expect to get a null if the caller believes the key exists.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded test.","created_at":"2021-06-07T00:02:45Z","updated_at":"2021-06-08T23:07:01Z","closed_at":"2021-06-08T16:10:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5ce9cef16e0a7161d36539b3efac739f65fc73aa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSwitching back the  \"PVs with local storage\" integration test on Docker driver.\r\n\r\nI have analyzed why this test was failing on my machine (I hope the root cause of the problem is OS agnostic).\r\nIt failed because of the mounting of the host directory into the Minikube node using the `--uid=185` (Spark user user id):\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ minikube mount ${PVC_TESTS_HOST_PATH}:${PVC_TESTS_VM_PATH} --9p-version=9p2000.L --gid=0 --uid=185 &; MOUNT_PID=$!\r\n```\r\n\r\nAre referring to a nonexistent user. See the the number of occurence of 185 in \"/etc/passwd\":\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ minikube ssh \"grep -c 185 /etc/passwd\"\r\n0\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis leads to a permission denied. Skipping the `--uid=185` won't help although the path will listable before the test execution:\r\n\r\n```\r\n╭─attilazsoltpiros@apiros-MBP16 ~/git/attilapiros/spark ‹SPARK-35430*›\r\n╰─$ 📁  Mounting host path /var/folders/t_/fr_vqcyx23vftk81ftz1k5hw0000gn/T/tmp.k9X4Gecv into VM as /var/folders/t_/fr_vqcyx23vftk81ftz1k5hw0000gn/T/tmp.k9X4Gecv ...\r\n    ▪ Mount type:\r\n    ▪ User ID:      docker\r\n    ▪ Group ID:     0\r\n    ▪ Version:      9p2000.L\r\n    ▪ Message Size: 262144\r\n    ▪ Permissions:  755 (-rwxr-xr-x)\r\n    ▪ Options:      map[]\r\n    ▪ Bind Address: 127.0.0.1:51740\r\n🚀  Userspace file server: ufs starting\r\n\r\n╭─attilazsoltpiros@apiros-MBP16 ~/git/attilapiros/spark ‹SPARK-35430*›\r\n╰─$ minikube ssh \"ls /var/folders/t_/fr_vqcyx23vftk81ftz1k5hw0000gn/T/tmp.k9X4Gecv\"\r\n╭─attilazsoltpiros@apiros-MBP16 ~/git/attilapiros/spark ‹SPARK-35430*›\r\n╰─$\r\n```   \r\n\r\nBut the test will fail and after its execution the `dmesg` shows the following error:\r\n```\r\n[13670.493359] bpfilter: Loaded bpfilter_umh pid 66153\r\n[13670.493363] bpfilter: write fail -32\r\n[13670.530737] bpfilter: Loaded bpfilter_umh pid 66155\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis `bpfilter` is a firewall module and we are back to a permission denied when we want to list the mounted directory.\r\n\r\nThe solution is to add a spark user with 185 uid when the minikube is started.\r\n\r\n**So this must be added to Jenkins job (and the mount should use --gid=0 --uid=185)**:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ minikube ssh \"sudo useradd spark -u 185 -g 0 -m -s /bin/bash\"             \r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis integration test is needed to validate the PVs feature. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo. It is just testing.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nRunning the test locally:\r\n```\r\nKubernetesSuite:\r\n- Run SparkPi with no resources\r\n- Run SparkPi with a very long application name.\r\n- Use SparkLauncher.NO_RESOURCE\r\n- Run SparkPi with a master URL without a scheme.\r\n- Run SparkPi with an argument.\r\n- Run SparkPi with custom labels, annotations, and environment variables.\r\n- All pods have the same service account by default\r\n- Run extraJVMOptions check on driver\r\n- Run SparkRemoteFileTest using a remote data file\r\n- Verify logging configuration is picked from the provided SPARK_CONF_DIR/log4j.properties\r\n- Run SparkPi with env and mount secrets.\r\n- Run PySpark on simple pi.py example\r\n- Run PySpark to test a pyfiles example\r\n- Run PySpark with memory customization\r\n- Run in client mode.\r\n- Start pod creation from template\r\n- PVs with local storage\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe \"PVs with local storage\" was successful but the next test `Launcher client dependencies` the minio stops the test executions on Mac (only on Mac):\r\n```\r\n21/06/29 04:33:32.449 ScalaTest-main-running-KubernetesSuite INFO ProcessUtils: 🏃  Starting tunnel for service minio-s3.\r\n21/06/29 04:33:33.425 ScalaTest-main-running-KubernetesSuite INFO ProcessUtils: |----------------------------------|----------|-------------|------------------------|\r\n21/06/29 04:33:33.426 ScalaTest-main-running-KubernetesSuite INFO ProcessUtils: |            NAMESPACE             |   NAME   | TARGET PORT |          URL           |\r\n21/06/29 04:33:33.426 ScalaTest-main-running-KubernetesSuite INFO ProcessUtils: |----------------------------------|----------|-------------|------------------------|\r\n21/06/29 04:33:33.426 ScalaTest-main-running-KubernetesSuite INFO ProcessUtils: | 7855c37ca34340c49a98aa8439f4935c | minio-s3 |             | http://127.0.0.1:62138 |\r\n21/06/29 04:33:33.426 ScalaTest-main-running-KubernetesSuite INFO ProcessUtils: |----------------------------------|----------|-------------|------------------------|\r\n21/06/29 04:33:33.449 ScalaTest-main-running-KubernetesSuite INFO ProcessUtils: http://127.0.0.1:62138\r\n21/06/29 04:33:33.449 ScalaTest-main-running-KubernetesSuite INFO ProcessUtils: ❗  Because you are using a Docker driver on darwin, the terminal needs to be open to run it.\r\n```\r\nThis is a different problem which is a docker desktop limitation (https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/networking/#per-container-ip-addressing-is-not-possible).\r\n \r\nOf course with the default driver on Mac, on hyperkit, all the tests are passing:\r\n```\r\n[INFO] --- scalatest-maven-plugin:2.0.0:test (integration-test) @ spark-kubernetes-integration-tests_2.12 ---\r\nDiscovery starting.\r\nDiscovery completed in 498 milliseconds.\r\nRun starting.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn `BlockManagerMasterEndpoint` for the disk persisted RDDs (when `spark.shuffle.service.fetch.rdd.enable` is enabled) we are keeping track the block status entries by external shuffle service instances (so on YARN we are basically keeping them by nodes). This is the `blockStatusByShuffleService` member val. And when all the RDD blocks are removed for one external shuffle service instance then the key and the empty map can be removed from `blockStatusByShuffleService`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIt is a small leak and I was asked to take care of it in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/32114#discussion_r640270377.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually by adding a temporary log line to check `blockStatusByShuffleService` value before and after the `removeRdd` and run the `SPARK-25888: using external shuffle service fetching disk persisted blocks` test in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR fixes an issue that both key and value of state schema cannot accept long length (>65535 bytes) JSON.\r\nTo solve the problem explained below, JSON represented schema is divided into chunks whose maximum length is 65535 bytes, and each chunk is written by `DataOutputStream.writeUTF`.\r\n\r\nAs the solution changes the format of the schema, the version is also changes from `1` to `2` but old version schema is still acceptable to ensures backward compatibility.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIn the current implementation, writing state schema fails if the length of schema exceeds 65535 bytes and `UTFDataFormatException` is thrown.\r\nIt's due to the limitation of `DataOutputStream.writeUTF`.\r\n`writeUTF` writes a length field first and it's 2 bytes width, meaning the maximum content length is limited to `2^16-1`=`65535` bytes.\r\nhttps://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/DataOutputStream.html#writeUTF-java.lang.String-\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nNew tests.","created_at":"2021-06-05T05:21:46Z","updated_at":"2021-06-09T09:48:42Z","closed_at":"2021-06-09T01:10:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8f49d559e67e050110ed1518e44fce8624070040","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR supports resolving star expressions in subqueries using outer query plans.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, Spark can only resolve star expressions using the inner query plan when resolving subqueries. Instead, it should also be able to resolve star expressions using the outer query plans.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR fixes an issue that `Dataset.observe` doesn't work if `CollectMetricsExec` in a task handles multiple partitions.\r\nIf `coalesce` follows `observe` and the number of partitions shrinks after `coalesce`, `CollectMetricsExec` can handle multiple partitions in a task.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe current implementation of `CollectMetricsExec` doesn't consider the case it can handle multiple partitions.\r\nBecause new `updater` is created for each partition even though those partitions belong to the same task, `collector.setState(updater)` raise an assertion error.\r\nThis is a simple reproducible example.\r\n```\r\n$ bin/spark-shell --master \"local[1]\"\r\nscala> spark.range(1, 4, 1, 3).observe(\"my_event\", count($\"id\").as(\"count_val\")).coalesce(2).collect\r\n```\r\n```\r\njava.lang.AssertionError: assertion failed\r\n\tat scala.Predef$.assert(Predef.scala:208)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.AggregatingAccumulator.setState(AggregatingAccumulator.scala:204)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.CollectMetricsExec.$anonfun$doExecute$2(CollectMetricsExec.scala:72)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.CollectMetricsExec.$anonfun$doExecute$2$adapted(CollectMetricsExec.scala:71)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.TaskContext$$anon$1.onTaskCompletion(TaskContext.scala:125)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.TaskContextImpl.$anonfun$markTaskCompleted$1(TaskContextImpl.scala:124)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.TaskContextImpl.$anonfun$markTaskCompleted$1$adapted(TaskContextImpl.scala:124)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.TaskContextImpl.$anonfun$invokeListeners$1(TaskContextImpl.scala:137)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.TaskContextImpl.$anonfun$invokeListeners$1$adapted(TaskContextImpl.scala:135)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nNew

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to change `DiskBlockManager` like the following to allow `ShuffleDataIO` to decide the behavior of shuffle file deletion.\r\n```scala\r\n- private[spark] class DiskBlockManager(conf: SparkConf, deleteFilesOnStop: Boolean)\r\n+ private[spark] class DiskBlockManager(conf: SparkConf, var deleteFilesOnStop: Boolean)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`SparkContext` creates\r\n1. `SparkEnv` (with `BlockManager` and its `DiskBlockManager`)\r\n2. loads `ShuffleDataIO`\r\n3. initialize block manager.\r\n```scala\r\n_env = createSparkEnv(_conf, isLocal, listenerBus)\r\n\r\n...\r\n_shuffleDriverComponents = ShuffleDataIOUtils.loadShuffleDataIO(config).driver()\r\n    _shuffleDriverComponents.initializeApplication().asScala.foreach { case (k, v) =>\r\n      _conf.set(ShuffleDataIOUtils.SHUFFLE_SPARK_CONF_PREFIX + k, v)\r\n    }\r\n...\r\n\r\n_env.blockManager.initialize(_applicationId)\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n`DiskBlockManager` is created first at `BlockManager` constructor and we cannot change `deleteFilesOnStop` later at `ShuffleDataIO`. By switching to `var`, we can implement enhanced shuffle data management feature via `ShuffleDataIO` like https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/32730 .\r\n```\r\n  val diskBlockManager = {\r\n    // Only perform cleanup if an external service is not serving our shuffle files.\r\n    val deleteFilesOnStop =\r\n      !externalShuffleServiceEnabled || executorId == SparkContext.DRIVER_IDENTIFIER\r\n    new DiskBlockManager(conf, deleteFilesOnStop)\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo. This is a private class.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nUse the key/value LambdaFunction to convert the elements instead of\r\nusing CatalystTypeConverters.createToScalaConverter. This is how it is\r\ndone in MapObjects and that correctly handles Arrays with case classes.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nBefore these changes the added test cases would fail with the

values and using the interpreted path would incorrect deserialize data from the catalyst representation.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, it fixes the bug.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting and new unit tests in the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes applying `black` to pandas API on Spark codes, for improving static analysis.\r\n\r\nBy executing the `./dev/reformat-python` in the spark home directory, all the code of the pandas API on Spark is fixed according to the static analysis rules.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis can be reduces the cost of static analysis during development.\r\n\r\nIt has been used continuously for about a year in the Koalas project and its convenience has been proven.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, it's dev-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually reformat the pandas API on Spark codes by running the `./dev/reformat-python`, and checked the `./dev/lint-python` is

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSplits some tests in `pyspark-pandas` module as slot tests to rebalance the test duration.\r\n\r\nPicked the top 12 tests from the previous runs and the total times are almost even.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently `pyspark-pandas` module tests take long time, so we should rebalance the tests.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting

For instance:\r\n```java\r\n  public void readIntegers(\r\n      int total,\r\n      WritableColumnVector c,\r\n      int rowId,\r\n      int level,\r\n      VectorizedValuesReader data) throws IOException {\r\n    int left = total;\r\n    while (left > 0) {\r\n      if (this.currentCount == 0) this.readNextGroup();\r\n      int n = Math.min(left, this.currentCount);\r\n      switch (mode) {\r\n        case RLE:\r\n          if (currentValue == level) {\r\n            data.readIntegers(n, c, rowId);\r\n          } else {\r\n            c.putNulls(rowId, n);\r\n          }\r\n          break;\r\n        case PACKED:\r\n          for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {\r\n            if (currentBuffer[currentBufferIdx++] == level) {\r\n              c.putInt(rowId + i, data.readInteger());\r\n            } else {\r\n              c.putNull(rowId + i);\r\n            }\r\n          }\r\n          break;\r\n      }\r\n      rowId += n;\r\n      left -= n;\r\n      currentCount -= n;\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nand replace with:\r\n```java\r\n  public void readBatch(\r\n       int total,\r\n       int offset,\r\n       WritableColumnVector values,\r\n       int maxDefinitionLevel,\r\n       VectorizedValuesReader valueReader,\r\n       ParquetVectorUpdater updater) throws IOException {\r\n     int left = total;\r\n     while (left > 0) {\r\n       if (this.currentCount == 0) this.readNextGroup();\r\n       int n = Math.min(left, this.currentCount);\r\n       switch (mode) {\r\n         case RLE:\r\n           if (currentValue == maxDefinitionLevel) {\r\n             updater.updateBatch(n, offset, values, valueReader);\r\n           } else {\r\n             values.putNulls(offset, n);\r\n           }\r\n           break;\r\n         case PACKED:\r\n           for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {\r\n             if (currentBuffer[currentBufferIdx++] == maxDefinitionLevel) {\r\n               updater.update(offset + i, values, valueReader);\r\n             } else {\r\n               values.putNull(offset + i);\r\n             }\r\n           }\r\n           break;\r\n       }\r\n       offset += n;\r\n       left -= n;\r\n       currentCount -= n;\r\n     }\r\n   }\r\n```\r\nwhere the `ParquetVectorUpdater` is type specific, and has different implementations under `updateBatch` and `update`. Together, this also changes code paths handling timestamp types to use the batch read API for decoding definition levels.\r\n\r\n2. Similar to the above, this removes code duplication in `VectorizedColumnReader.decodeDictionaryIds`. Now different implementations are under `ParquetVectorUpdater.decodeSingleDictionaryId`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n`VectorizedRleValuesReader` and `VectorizedColumnReader` are becoming increasingly harder to maintain, as any change touches the above logic **will need to be replicated in 20+ places**. The issue becomes even more serious when we are going to implement column index (for instance, see how the change [here](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/32753/files#diff-a01e174e178366aadf07f64ee690d47d343b2ca416a4a2b2ea735887c22d5934R191) has to be replicated multiple times) and complex type support (in progress) for the vectorized path.\r\n\r\nIn addition, currently dictionary decoding (see `VectorizedColumnReader.decodeDictionaryIds`) and non-dictionary decoding are handled separately, and therefore the same (very complicated) branching logic based on input Spark & Parquet types have to be replicated in two places, which is another burden for code maintenance. \r\n\r\nThe original intention is for performance. However these days JIT compilers tend to be very effective on this and will inline virtual calls aggressively to eliminate the method invocation costs (see [this](https://shipilev.net/blog/2015/black-magic-method-dispatch/) and [this](http://insightfullogic.com/blog/2014/may/12/fast-and-megamorphic-what-influences-method-invoca/)). I've also done benchmarks using a modified `DataSourceReadBenchmark` and `DateTimeRebaseBenchmark` and the result is almost exact the same before and after the change. The results can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/sunchao/674afbf942ccc2370bdcfa33efb4471c), and [here's](https://github.com/sunchao/spark/tree/parquet-refactor) the source code.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIntroduces `InternalField` to manage dtypes and `StructField`s.\r\n\r\n`InternalFrame` is already managing dtypes, but when it checks the Spark's data types, column names, and nullabilities, it tries to run the analysis phase each time it needs, which will cause a performance issue.\r\n\r\nIt will use `InternalField` class which stores the retrieved Spark's data types, column names, and nullabilities, and reuse them. Also, in case those can be known, just update and reuse them without asking Spark.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently there are some performance issues in the pandas-on-Spark layer.\r\n\r\nOne of them is accessing Java DataFrame and run analysis phase too many times, especially just for retrieving the current column names or data types.\r\n\r\nWe should reduce the amount of unnecessary access.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nImproves the performance in pandas-on-Spark layer:\r\n\r\n```py\r\ndf = ps.read_parquet(\"/path/to/test.parquet\")  # contains ~75 columns\r\ndf = df[(df[\"col\"] > 0) & (df[\"col\"] < 10000)]\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore the PR, it took about **2.15 sec** and after **1.15 sec**.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests.","created_at":"2021-06-03T22:31:05Z","updated_at":"2021-06-08T02:57:40Z","closed_at":"2021-06-08T02:57:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"87acb26c4924f24e7c74ff1ca649e7ede8e664d7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32775/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32775/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/32775/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e0c9767ae6a1ec625995616da387dd3b0e88455c","head":{"label":"ueshin:issues/SPARK-35638/field","ref":"issues/SPARK-35638/field","sha":"e0c9767ae6a1ec625995616da387dd3b0e88455c","user":{"login":"ueshin","id":506656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin","html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17234665,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzNDY2NQ==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"ueshin/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ueshin","id":506656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin","html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdjust the `check_exact` parameter for non-numeric columns to ensure pandas-on-Spark tests passed with all pandas versions.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n`pd.testing` utils are utilized in pandas-on-Spark tests.\r\nDue to https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/35446, `check_exact=True` for non-numeric columns doesn't work for older pd.testing utils, e.g. `assert_series_equal`.  We wanted to adjust that to ensure pandas-on-Spark tests pass for all pandas versions.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nExisting unit tests.\r\n\r\nKeyword:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn functions.py, there is a function added `def column(col)`. There is also another method in the same file `def col(col)`. This leads to some ambiguity on whether the parameter is being referred to or the function. In pyspark 3.1.2, this leads to `TypeError: 'str' object is not callable` when the function `column(col)` is called - the highest preference is given to the string variable in scope as opposed to the function `col `in the file as intended. \r\n\r\nThis PR fixes that ambiguity by changing the variable name to `col_like`. I have filed this as an issue on JIRA here - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-35643. \r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn pyspark 3.1.2, we see `TypeError: 'str' object is not callable` when `column()` function is called. This Pr fixes that error.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nI don't believe this patch needs additional testing. \r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nImproved `ExpandExec` so it would retain its child's outputPartitioning, when possible. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently `ExpandExecs` `outputPartitioning` is always `UnknownPartitioning(0)`. In some cases we do actually know the correct output partitioning. In those cases we could reduce the number of exchanges by using the correct partitioning.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR is adding a thread which will run at scheduled interval to ask a batch of executors to start decommissioning themselves.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCurrenlty, each executor is asked to starts offloading rdd and shuffle blocks as soon it is decommissioned. This can overload the network bandwidth of the application.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nUT in

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nHandle type coercion when resolving V2 function. In particular:\r\n- prior to evaluating function arguments, insert cast whenever the argument type doesn't match the expected input type.\r\n- use `BoundFunction.inputTypes()` to lookup magic method for scalar function\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFor V2 functions, the actual argument types should not necessarily match those of the input types, and Spark should handle type coercion whenever it is needed.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes. Now V2 function resolution should be able to handle type coercion properly.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded a few new tests.","created_at":"2021-06-03T06:02:40Z","updated_at":"2021-06-09T15:10:58Z","closed_at":"2021-06-09T13:22:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5d3f47970f346efc00007ec18e97109a6c80c316","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32764/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32764/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/32764/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8d45492820b06db07e53501a7bb040c9ab596521","head":{"label":"sunchao:SPARK-35390","ref":"SPARK-35390","sha":"8d45492820b06db07e53501a7bb040c9ab596521","user":{"login":"sunchao","id":506679,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506679?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao","html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":29795757,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTc5NTc1Nw==","name":"spark","full_name":"sunchao/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sunchao","id":506679,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506679?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao","html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to remove PySpark documentation build in linter check because:\r\n\r\n- to speed up CI build by removing duplicate documentation build (linter and doc build)\r\n- for https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/32726. With this PR PySpark documentation build requires a full Spark build to generate plot images in PySpark documentation. It makes less sense to require it in Python linter.\r\n- to remove unnecessary dependency installation for Python linter in CI\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nPython linter script includes documentation build. Because of this, we run documentation builds duplicately in CI, and requires unnecessary dependencies to be installed, and takes extra time. It would more make sense to exclude this in Python linter.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, dev-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested, and it will be tested in CI.\r\n","created_at":"2021-06-03T02:11:51Z","updated_at":"2022-01-04T00:53:46Z","closed_at":"2021-06-03T03:48:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"aa92eb99befaf553c33911e127214e2bf5972f25","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1982110661,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMTEwNjYx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/INFRA","name":"INFRA","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32760/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32760/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/32760/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ae2e5c5c7628b522b93ae010a0a4cd778863e7ba","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-35620","ref":"SPARK-35620","sha":"ae2e5c5c7628b522b93ae010a0a4cd778863e7ba","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCache commonly occurring duplicate Some objects in SQLMetrics by using a Guava cache and reusing the existing Guava String Interner to avoid duplicate strings in JSONProtocol. Also with AccumulatorV2 we have seen lot of Some(-1L) and Some(0L) occurrences in a heap dump that is naively interned by having reusing a already constructed Some(-1L) and Some(0L)\r\n\r\nTo give some context on the impact and the garbage got accumulated, below are the details of the complex spark job which we troubleshooted and figured out the bottlenecks. **tl;dr - In short, major issues were the accumulation of duplicate objects mainly from SQLMetrics.**\r\n\r\nGreater than 25% of the 40G driver heap filled with (a very large number of) **duplicate**, immutable objects.\r\n\r\n1. Very large number of **duplicate** immutable objects.\r\n\r\n- Type of metric is represented by `'scala.Some(\"sql\")'` - which is created for each metric.\r\n- Fixing this reduced memory usage from 4GB to a few bytes.\r\n\r\n2. `scala.Some(0)` and `scala.Some(-1)` are very common metric values (typically to indicate absence of metric)\r\n\r\n- Individually the values are all immutable, but spark sql was creating a new instance each time.\r\n- Intern'ing these resulted in saving ~4.5GB for a 40G heap.\r\n\r\n3. Using string interpolation for metric names.\r\n\r\n- Interpolation results in creation of a new string object.\r\n- We end up with a very large number of metric names - though the number of unique strings is miniscule.\r\n- ~7.5 GB in the 40 GB heap : which went down to a few KB's when fixed.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo reduce overall driver memory footprint which eventually reduces the Full GC pauses.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nSince these are memory related optimizations, unit tests are not added. These changes are added in our internal platform which made it possible for one of the complex spark job continuously failing to succeed along with other set of optimizations.\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n","created_at":"2021-06-02T18:55:41Z","updated_at":"2021-06-16T03:02:46Z","closed_at":"2021-06-16T03:02:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d31440ec3f13ad89414dfc270099493d31bff121","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32754/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/32754/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/32754/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2cb9f8a8236d5c8b04cb4f9f50f7110b76276a33","head":{"label":"venkata91:SPARK-35613","ref":"SPARK-35613","sha":"2cb9f8a8236d5c8b04cb4f9f50f7110b76276a33","user":{"login":"venkata91","id":8871522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NzE1MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8871522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91","html_url":"https://github.com/venkata91","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":170915684,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzA5MTU2ODQ=","name":"spark","full_name":"venkata91/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"venkata91","id":8871522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NzE1MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8871522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91","html_url":"https://github.com/venkata91","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/venkata91/spark","description":"Apache

In particular, this PR makes the following changes:\r\n1. in `ParquetReadState`, track row ranges returned via `PageReadStore.getRowIndexes` as well as the first row index for each page via `DataPage.getFirstRowIndex`.\r\n1. introduced a new API `ParquetVectorUpdater.skipValues` which skips a batch of values from a Parquet value reader. As part of the process also renamed existing `updateBatch` to `readValues`, and `update` to `readValue` to keep the method names consistent.\r\n1. in correspondence as above, also introduced new API `VectorizedValuesReader.skipXXX` for different data types, as well as the implementations. These are useful when the reader knows that the given batch of values can be skipped, for instance, due to the batch is not covered in the row ranges generated by column index filtering.\r\n2. changed `VectorizedRleValuesReader` to handle column index filtering. This is done by comparing the range that is going to be read next within the current RLE/PACKED block (let's call this block range), against the current row range. There are three cases:\r\n    * if the block range is before the current row range, skip all the values in the block range\r\n    * if the block range is after the current row range, advance the row range and repeat the steps\r\n    * if the block range overlaps with the current row range, only read the values within the overlapping area and skip the rest.\r\n   \r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n[Parquet Column Index](https://github.com/apache/parquet-format/blob/master/PageIndex.md) is a new feature in Parquet 1.11 which allows very efficient filtering on page level (some benchmark numbers can be found [here](https://blog.cloudera.com/speeding-up-select-queries-with-parquet-page-indexes/)), especially when data is sorted. The feature is largely implemented in parquet-mr (via classes such as `ColumnIndex` and `ColumnIndexFilter`). In Spark, the non-vectorized Parquet reader can automatically benefit from the feature after upgrading to Parquet 1.11.x, without any code change. However, the same is not true for vectorized Parquet reader since Spark chose to implement its own logic such as reading Parquet pages, handling definition levels, reading values into columnar batches, etc.\r\n\r\nPreviously, [SPARK-26345](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-26345) / (#31393) updated Spark to only scan pages filtered by column index from parquet-mr side. This is done by calling `ParquetFileReader.readNextFilteredRowGroup` and `ParquetFileReader.getFilteredRecordCount` API. The implementation, however, only work for a few limited cases: in the scenario where there are multiple columns and their type width are different (e.g., `int` and `bigint`), it could return incorrect result. For this issue, please see SPARK-34859 for a detailed description.\r\n\r\nIn order to fix the above, Spark needs to leverage the API `PageReadStore.getRowIndexes` and `DataPage.getFirstRowIndex`. The former returns the indexes of all rows (note the difference between rows and values: for flat schema there is no difference between the two, but for nested schema they're different) after filtering within a Parquet row group. The latter returns the first row index within a single data page. With the combination of the two, one is able to know which rows/values should be filtered while scanning a Parquet page.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes. Now the vectorized Parquet reader should work correctly with column index.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nBorrowed tests from #31998 and added a few more

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd a new config that controls the timeout of waiting for driver pod's readiness before allocating executor pods. This wait only happens once on application start.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe driver's headless service can be resolved by DNS only after the driver pod is ready. If the executor tries to connect to the headless service before driver pod is ready, it will hit UnkownHostException and get into error state but will not be restarted. **This case usually happens when the driver pod has sidecar containers but hasn't finished their creation when executors start.** So basically there is a race condition. This issue can be mitigated by tweaking this config.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nA new config `spark.kubernetes.allocation.driver.readinessTimeout` added.\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisiting tests.\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error message, please read the guideline first:\r\n     https://spark.apache.org/error-message-guidelines.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nUpgrade flake8 to 3.8.0 or above in Jenkins\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIn flake8 < 3.8.0, F401 error occurs for imports in if statements when TYPE_CHECKING is True. However, TYPE_CHECKING is always False at runtime, so there is no need to treat it as an error in static analysis.\r\n\r\nSince this behavior is fixed In flake8 >= 3.8.0, we should upgrade the flake8 installed in Jenkins to 3.8.0 or above. Otherwise, it occurs F401 error for several lines in pandas-on-PySpark that use TYPE_CHECKING\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nPass the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFixing the memory leak by deregistering the shutdown hook when the executor is stopped. This way the Garbage Collector can release the executor object early. Which is a huge win for our tests as user's classloader could be also released which keeps references to objects which are created for the jars on the classpath.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nI have identified this leak by running the Livy tests (I know it is close to the attic but this leak causes a constant OOM there) and it is in our Spark unit tests as well. \r\n\r\nThis leak can be identified by checking the number of `LeakyEntry` in case of Scala 2.12.14 (and `ZipEntry` for Scala 2.12.10) instances which with its related data can take up a considerable amount of memory (as those are created from the jars which are on the classpath).\r\n\r\nI have my own tool for instrumenting JVM code [trace-agent](https://github.com/attilapiros/trace-agent) and with that I am able to call JVM diagnostic commands at specific methods. Let me show how it in action.\r\n \r\nIt has a single text file embedded into the tool's jar called action.txt. \r\nIn this case actions.txt content is:\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\n$ unzip -q -c trace-agent-0.0.7.jar actions.txt\r\ndiagnostic_command org.apache.spark.repl.ReplSuite runInterpreter  cmd:gcClassHistogram,limit_output_lines:8,where:beforeAndAfter,with_gc:true\r\ndiagnostic_command org.apache.spark.repl.ReplSuite afterAll  cmd:gcClassHistogram,limit_output_lines:8,where:after,with_gc:true\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nWhich creates a class histogram at the beginning and at the end of `org.apache.spark.repl.ReplSuite#runInterpreter()` (after triggering a GC which might not finish as GC is done in a separate thread..) and one histogram in the end of the `org.apache.spark.repl.ReplSuite#afterAll()` method.\r\n\r\nAnd the histograms are the followings on master branch:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ./build/sbt \";project repl;set Test/javaOptions += \\\"-javaagent:/Users/attilazsoltpiros/git/attilapiros/memoryLeak/trace-agent-0.0.7.jar\\\";

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to introduce the strategy on mismatched offset for start offset timestamp on Kafka data source.\r\n\r\nPlease read the section `Why are the changes needed?` to understand the rationalization of the functionality.\r\n\r\nThis would be pretty much helpful for the case where there's a skew between partitions and some partitions have older records.\r\n\r\n* AS-IS: Spark simply fails the query and end users have to deal with workarounds requiring manual steps.\r\n* TO-BE: Spark will assign the latest offset for these partitions, so that Spark can read newer records from these partitions in further micro-batches.\r\n\r\nTo retain the existing behavior and also give some help for the proposed \"TO-BE\" behavior, we'd like to introduce the strategy on mismatched offset for start offset timestamp to let end users choose from them.\r\n\r\nThe strategy will be added as source option, to ensure end users set the behavior explicitly (otherwise simply \"known\" default value).\r\n\r\n* New source option to be added: startingOffsetsByTimestampStrategy\r\n* Available values: `error` (fail the query as referred as AS-IS), `latest` (set the offset to the latest as referred as TO-BE)\r\n\r\nDoc changes are following:\r\n\r\n![ES-106042-doc-screenshot-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1317309/120472697-2c1ba800-c3e1-11eb-884f-f28152168053.png)\r\n![ES-106042-doc-screenshot-2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1317309/120472719-33db4c80-c3e1-11eb-9851-939be8a3ddb7.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWe encountered a real-world case Spark fails the query if some of the partitions don't have matching offset by timestamp.\r\n\r\nThis is intended behavior to avoid bring unintended output for some cases like:\r\n\r\n* timestamp 2 is presented as timestamp-offset, but the some of partitions don't have the record yet\r\n* record with timestamp 1 comes \"later\" in the following micro-batch\r\n\r\nwhich is possible since Kafka allows to specify the timestamp in record.\r\n\r\nHere the unintended output we talked about was the risk of reading record with timestamp 1 in the next micro-batch despite the option specifying timestamp 2.\r\n\r\nBut for many cases end users just suppose timestamp is increasing monotonically with wall clocks are all in sync, and current behavior blocks these cases to make progress.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, but not a breaking change. It's up to end users to choose the behavior which the default value is \"error\" (current behavior). And it's a source option (not config) so they need to explicitly set the behavior to let the functionality takes effect.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew UTs.","created_at":"2021-06-02T11:34:26Z","updated_at":"2021-06-21T08:10:45Z","closed_at":"2021-06-21T07:37:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a9547246a2febcd011ad345bac8765e28208fcfa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED
