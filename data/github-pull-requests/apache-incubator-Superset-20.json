The function extract tables in both ways:\r\n\r\n- Extract any tables referenced within the confines of specific Jinja macros.\r\n- Parse SQL and get tables.\r\n\r\nIn the line I changed, there is simply a bug that uses `template` which has type Template. The correct one should be `sql`, which is a string sent by the user.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nReproduce steps:\r\n\r\n1. Create a new user\r\n2. Create a role with permission: \"schema access on [examples].[main]\"\r\n3. Assign the user to the role and \"sql_lab\" role\r\n4. Log in with the new user and go to SQL Lab.\r\n5. Write a simple query and execute it. You will see that the `/api/v1/sqllab/execute/` endpoint returns 500\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\n- Fixes:

SUMMARY\r\nFixes some issues found while testing Line and Area chart migrations (ECharts) using Airbnb's production data:\r\n- Ensures `groupby` is an array. Even though the Typescript definition does not allow `null` values, legacy charts might have them. Check https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/25419 for more context about this problem.\r\n- Adjusts the title left margin when a title is set\r\n- Disables Y-axis zoom for stacked charts\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nCI is sufficient as I'm already testing the migrations with a lot of data.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible\r\n  - [ ] Confirm DB migration upgrade and downgrade tested\r\n  - [ ] Runtime estimates and downtime expectations provided\r\n- [ ] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or API\r\n","created_at":"2024-05-03T12:15:41Z","updated_at":"2024-11-27T01:42:47Z","closed_at":"2024-05-07T13:40:33Z","merged_at":"2024-05-07T13:40:33Z","merge_commit_sha":"b4ab36a6a54d68ba0ac1356d8caaee5d1ed0e91f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1330950144,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzMwOTUwMTQ0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/size/S","name":"size/S","color":"C8B6FF","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2532694914,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTMyNjk0OTE0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/viz:charts:echarts","name":"viz:charts:echarts","color":"D4C5F9","default":false,"description":"Related

[Apache Spark](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset/db_engine_specs/spark.py) there's no associated entry in the engine to SQLGlot dialect mapping, meaning that certain Spark SQL

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nContinuing the work on https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/22862. This PR:\r\n\r\n- Adds catalog support to the Postgres DB engine spec (in Postgres, a catalog is called a \"database\").\r\n- Adds a new endpoint `/catalogs/` under the DB API, to list catalogs.\r\n- Adds an optional parameter `catalog` to the `/schemas/` DB API, to specify a non-default catalog.\r\n- Updates the security manager and model to manage catalog-level permissions (automatically creating, renaming, and deleting them, similar to how we do for for schemas).\r\n\r\nThese are all backend changes that shouldn't affect the current behavior of Superset, other than introducing the new permissions. Note that as of today users can query different catalogs in SQL Lab, and even create (virtual) datasets in different catalogs, and our SQL parser is able to handle catalogs correctly; because of that, introducing these new permissions can be considered a security improvement.\r\n\r\nIn the next PR I'll start working on the UI to expose the catalog functionality, and enabling support for multi-catalog in a given database will be optional and default to false.\r\n\r\n<del>One thing that I'm not sure about is when we should rename existing schema permissions from `[db].[schema]` to `[db].[default-catalog].[schema]`. In this PR I'm doing it when the database gets updated. I don't think doing it in a migration is a good solution, because we'd have to add a new migration every time a DB engine spec is updated to support catalogs. Another option would be to do it during `superset init` — @dpgaspar do you have any thoughts here?</de>\r\n\r\n<b>Edit:</b> added a migration for the schema permissions, done by a helper function, and a comment in the base DB engine spec informing that when `supports_catalog` is set to `True` a migration is necessary.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n<img width=\"650\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2024-05-01 at 1 34 33 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/1534870/57f1281e-21ac-4a7c-a3a3-5ee2b0ecec65\">\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nThe superset feature allows users to choose a non-temporal column for the x-axis.\r\nHowever, when a non-temporal column is selected, advanced analytics and forecast options are not compatible.\r\n\r\nIn order to address this, UI should dynamically hide these features when a non-temporal column is selected.\r\nThis commit introduces the visibility option in the ControlPanelSectionConfig, enabling the hiding of specific groups of controlSets.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

reused as the Introduction page at  `https://superset.apache.org/docs/`\r\n- this should also fix missing image links on [pypi.org](https://pypi.org/project/apache-superset/)\r\n- doing a simple `cp README.md docs/docs/` on docs `yarn build` and `yarn start`, tried using a symlink instead but that didn't work out of the box...\r\n- standardizing the use of h1/h2/h3 (in markdown aligning the number of `#`)\r\n- ran `yarn upgrade`\r\n- hid link out icons in navbar dropdown\r\n- added links to top navbar dropdown parent\r\n\r\n# before hiding link icons\r\n<img width=\"193\"

between upgrading superset docker/native itself and the metadata database to indicate that upgrading the database is necessary in either case.\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nIndicate that `superset db upgrade` and `superset init` are necessary after upgrading superset, independent of the deployment method.\r\n\r\nPersonally it was obvious that `superset db upgrade` was needed, but at that point I already felt the documentation could be clearer. I didn't execute `superset init` though, as it was not obvious from the `Docker Compose` section of the upgrade guide. I thought some weird HTTP 403 errors in the SQLLAB were a regression in 4.0.0 until I stumbled upon this line by accident, which, after execution, fixed everything.","created_at":"2024-04-30T12:14:59Z","updated_at":"2024-11-27T01:43:27Z","closed_at":"2024-04-30T16:28:16Z","merged_at":"2024-04-30T16:28:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"f03de27a9255d29fb308958c58d234a8ec3c3569","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"dpgaspar","id":4025227,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMjUyMjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4025227?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar","html_url":"https://github.com/dpgaspar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1329183122,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzI5MTgzMTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/size/XS","name":"size/XS","color":"E2D8FF","default":false,"description":""},{"id":3815127807,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAlosUs7jZjr_","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/doc","name":"doc","color":"6f9eaf","default":false,"description":"Namespace

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nWhen we run a query we replace `%%` (in certain SQLAlchemy dialects) with `%`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/blob/76d897eaa2f9e137102bc194c2e3109c29d0348f/superset/models/core.py#L668-L669\r\n\r\nThese dialects use `pyformat` (`%(name)s`) or `format` (`%s`) to parameterize arguments passed to the cursor. Normally we'd need to pass `%%` for literal percent signs, but the current behavior for most databases (Postgres, Presto, MySQL, Hive, Druid) is to accept unescaped percent symbols when no parameters are passed — which is the case for the calls Superset does to `cursor.execute`.\r\n\r\nThis logic is missing from `values_for_column`, which results in queries that are valid but, for some reason, extremely slow in Druid:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT * FROM t WHERE name LIKE '%%a';  -- slow\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile the expected query is fast:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT * FROM t WHERE name LIKE '%a';  -- fast\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the same behavior to the `values_for_column` method.\r\n\r\nNote that while drivers accept unescaped percent symbols when no parameters are passed to the cursor, this behavior is undocument in the DB API 2.0 spec. Ideally we'd not do this replacement in Superset, and instead:\r\n\r\n1. In SQL Lab we'd escape `%` by replacing it with `%%` before sending the query to the DB.\r\n2. When going from Explore to SQL Lab we'd unescape `%%` back to `%`.\r\n\r\nThis way Superset is not relying on undocument behavior. But that fix is more complicated and requires a lot of testing.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

This means that queries should be parameterized with `%s` for the placeholders, like this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ncursor.execute(\"SELECT * FROM t WHERE role = '%s'\", (\"engineer\",))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe driver then performs \"old-school\" string interpolation:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nsql = \"SELECT * FROM t WHERE role = '%s'\"\r\nparameters = (\"engineer\",)\r\nescaped_parameters = escape_parameters(parameters)  # important to prevent SQL injection\r\nfinal_query = sql % escaped_parameters\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause of the percent interpolation, when SQL compiles a query for [a database that uses `pyformat` or `format`](https://github.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/blob/6888cf79db79d5e5660300ccf2a2a91f1eecf75f/lib/sqlalchemy/sql/compiler.py#L7361-L7364), any percent symbols in the query are escaped by being replaced with `%%`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/blob/6888cf79db79d5e5660300ccf2a2a91f1eecf75f/lib/sqlalchemy/sql/compiler.py#L2652-L2653\r\n\r\nFor some reason we undo that process (introduced in https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/5178):\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/blob/76d897eaa2f9e137102bc194c2e3109c29d0348f/superset/models/core.py#L668-L669\r\n\r\nThe code above doesn't make sense. If SQLAlchemy is replacing `%` with `%%` for databases where `dialect.identifier_preparer._double_percents` is true, why would we reverse it when we compile the query for the same databases?\r\n\r\nOne clue can be found in another codepath were we compile the query, but that replacement is missing. In `values_for_column`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/blob/44690fb299ab3b7adc24e84eeec73bccdde14420/superset/models/helpers.py#L1380-L1384\r\n\r\n@Vitor-Avila noticed that here, when the column is a calculated column containing a percent symbol, like:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\ncase when column like '%a%' then 1 else 0 end\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen the generated SQL being sent to the database is:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\ncase when column like '%%a%%' then 1 else 0 end\r\n``` \r\n\r\nNote that the query above is completely valid and syntactically equivalent to the original one, so everything works as expected when we run it... except that in Druid, the query performs extremely poorly, compared to the one with a single percent. This suggests that the fix is to add `sql = sql.replace(\"%%\", \"%\")` to the `values_for_column` method as well.\r\n\r\nBut again... why are we undoing what SQLAlchemy is doing?\r\n\r\nLooking deeper into the problem, I found a bug in pydruid:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/druid-io/pydruid/blob/1d72d26c3e14bc9a7c6725dfa877c98a7afbe6f3/pydruid/db/api.py#L430-L435\r\n\r\nNote that in the code above, when no parameters are passed to `execute` — which is the case when Superset calls the method — the string interpolation never happens, because the SQL is returned early! This means that any escaped percent symbols (`%%`) **will not** be unescaped to `%`.\r\n\r\nI've fixed pydruid in https://github.com/druid-io/pydruid/pull/317, and made a new release. This PR bumps the version to the fixed one, and removes the `sql = sql.replace(\"%%\", \"%\")` logic completely. This way, when double percents are passed to pydruid, they will be unescaped **by the driver**, as expected.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n\r\nI tested with Postgres, since psycopg2 uses `pyformat`.

SUMMARY\r\nRecently when I set up `ruff` (new linter/formatter that replaces black, isort, pyupgrade, ...) I didn't check that isort rules were enabled properly, this PR:\r\n\r\n- enables the isort-like features\r\n- configures them in ways that match the settings we had originally, minimize changes\r\n- runs `ruff check --fix` with these new settings - everything here except a single change was auto-fixed in milliseconds\r\n\r\nFor the record, my configuration is based on the one suggested here ->  https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/4670#issuecomment-1920024170\r\n\r\nFor convenience, the list of all possible isort-related configs: https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#lint_isort_lines-after-imports.\r\n\r\nNote that now that this is so fast and `--fix` works very well, it'd be easy to reconsider some configs if we wanted, for example setting `lines-after-imports = 2` instead of `-1` could be nice.","created_at":"2024-04-29T17:45:42Z","updated_at":"2024-11-27T01:43:24Z","closed_at":"2024-05-01T01:29:49Z","merged_at":"2024-05-01T01:29:49Z","merge_commit_sha":"3ac387bb66e1b1867857d5c40db1883a42e62819","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"villebro","id":33317356,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzE3MzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33317356?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro","html_url":"https://github.com/villebro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"rusackas","id":812905,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMjkwNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/812905?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas","html_url":"https://github.com/rusackas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1127990345,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTI3OTkwMzQ1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/risk:db-migration","name":"risk:db-migration","color":"e67e22","default":false,"description":"PRs

SUMMARY\r\nAn issue reported in https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/28001 shows SQL Lab failing hard when a database driver returns a type that can't be decoded for serialization. Switching to this pessimistic helper function for json serialization will prevent a hard failure, but will obfuscate the data for the specific cells where things can't be serialized.\r\n\r\nNot being in a situation where I can reproduce the issue, I'm operating with the stacktrace, meaning I can't really handle the specific cell, but can prevent SQL Lab from failing hard on a single cell issue.\r\n\r\nFew related notes:\r\n- maybe there's something around the driver being in utf8 mode of some kind. In theory we could say that driver / superset should agree on utf8 for things to work\r\n- driver should probably giving us a `bytes` type from a `VARBINARY` and from the stacktrace it appears to be something else, presumably `str`, though that's unclear\r\n- could be good to refactor out everything json-related out of superset/utils/core.py and into a new superset/utils/json.py, and make sure we always use thesame utility functions throughout the codebase as opposed to raw `import json` across the codebase. From my understanding there's some magic around simplejson injecting itself everywhere that happens too.\r\n\r\n\r\ncloses

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nSo... after much ado of getting the Jupyter Notebook up to snuff, this PR adds as many of the countries as I could support. It pulls things from Natural Earth data just... as they are. We might need to adjust some disputed territories, move some islands closer to the mainland, etc., but in broad strokes, this should make us truly global, and we can continue to make overrides to Natural Earth in the notebook as we always have.\r\n\r\nThis does even more now!\r\n* Strips out countries that have only one region, and would therefore be useless as a choropleth\r\n* Standardizes display of maps (now with more colors!)\r\n* Organizes a bit and cleans out some useless cells\r\n* Pretties up the country preview grid\r\n* Simplifies geometry for the country preview grid\r\n* Skips the first preview_all_countries, since it takes a while and you don't _ususally_ need it\r\n* Adds a TODO list of countries that could use layout adjustments due to distant islands.\r\n* Removes the legacy countries_custom folder of geojson files... let's not have that!\r\n* adds a \"speed run\" mode that skips rendering charts, and makes it WAAAAAY faster to just update maps locally or as part of CI.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nDeckGl polygon has an onclick function that emits a filter event. This doesn't seem to work as expected on the latest master and we were getting some errors. With these changes I have added the ability to setData mask (a filter at dashboard level). \r\nI have made the changes based on what I understood of the plugin directory structure. I would be really helpful if you can verify these changes or guide me on how to add dashboard level filters with DeckGL polygon.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nSomeone filled an issue about search index referring to dead links in our\r\ndocumentation. Turns out many of the top links when googling `apache\r\nsuperset documentation` point to 404s now.\r\n\r\nIn this PR I'm trying to set up client-side redirects to the related pages.\r\n\r\nNote that the docs for this plugin state that server-side redirects are\r\nbetter, and that the redirects don't work in dev, only prod, which\r\nmakes it hard to test\r\n\r\nIn the future, we'll need more rigor around catching dead links,\r\neither during code review for the docs, or through some docusaurus\r\nautomation magic forcing us to come up with redirects whenever we kill\r\nroutes.\r\n\r\n [Docusaurus redirect plugin documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/plugins/@docusaurus/plugin-client-redirects) for reference\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nI took the freedom to run `gh workflow run superset-docs-deploy.yml -r docs_redirect`, [logs here](https://github.com/apache/superset/actions/runs/8863837953/job/24338367534) since there's no way to test in dev and wanted this fix

releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v5.3.3</h2>\n<h2>Highlights</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a breaking change introduced with color modes where it was required to manually import <code>variables-dark.scss</code> when building Bootstrap with Sass. Now, <code>_variables.scss</code> will automatically import <code>_variables-dark.scss</code>.

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nSimply ignore the build warning related to [@data-ui](https://github.com/williaster/data-ui/issues/208#issuecomment-946966712).\r\nBecause this warning arises from within the external module itself, [which is no longer evolving](https://github.com/williaster/data-ui/issues/201), the idea is to ignore it until the module can be replaced by a living project to better fit the superset ecosystem.\r\n\r\nExample warning:\r\n\r\n```zsh\r\nWARNING in ./node_modules/@data-ui/shared/esm/enhancer/WithTooltip.js 3:60-78\r\nexport 'withTooltipPropTypes' (imported as 'vxTooltipPropTypes') was not found in '@vx/tooltip/build/tooltips/TooltipWithBounds' (possible exports: __esModule, default)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis is a workaround to suppress the `./locale` build warning when using the webpack dev-server involving a [well documented](https://github.com/moment/moment/issues/4519) ([more reports](https://github.com/moment/moment/issues/4216)) bug in the now [defunct `moment` library](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/-project-status/). This is meant to remove the warning, anticipating a migration away from `moment` in the future. \r\n\r\nExample warning\r\n\r\n```zsh\r\nWARNING in ./node_modules/moment/min/moment-with-locales.js 2159:16-50\r\nModule not found: Error: Can't resolve './locale' in 'superset-frontend/node_modules/moment/min'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nFor some reason the 3.x version of the Dremio driver shows the dialect as `dremio+flight`, instead of simply `dremio` with the driver `flight`.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds `dremio+flight` to the list of aliases in the Dremio DB engine spec, so that Dremio shows up in the database dropdown correctly.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n\r\nTested locally, connected to Dremio:\r\n\r\n1. Run Dremio locally: docker run -p 9047:9047 -p 31010:31010 -p 32010:32010 -p 45678:45678 dremio/dremio-oss\r\n2. Visit http://localhost:9047/ and create an account.\r\n3. Use dremio+flight://username:password@localhost:32010/?UseEncryption=false for the SQLAlchemy URI.\r\n4. Run a query.\r\n\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has

SUMMARY\r\nI tried installing from PyPI and found that some steps were missing or out of order.  I removed irrelevant text, added other instructions, and reordered things.\r\n\r\nAny concerns about suggesting that people install into a directory `/superset` and set up their virtual environment there?\r\n\r\nThere's now some redundancy with Configuring Superset docs, as they also talk about creating a `superset_config.py` file.  Because the proper time to create one is in the install phase, when you are specifying a `SECRET_KEY`, I feel this belongs in this page.  I think we should add the corresponding creating-a-config content to the install methods, then remove from Configuring Superset as everyone will have done it by that point.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nFollow these steps on a fresh Linux machine and see if they work.  Please test!","created_at":"2024-04-25T19:33:27Z","updated_at":"2024-09-12T15:52:08Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"hughhhh","id":27827808,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3ODI3ODA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27827808?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughhhh","html_url":"https://github.com/hughhhh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughhhh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughhhh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughhhh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughhhh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughhhh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughhhh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughhhh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughhhh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hughhhh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1329203144,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzI5MjAzMTQ0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/size/M","name":"size/M","color":"705FA3","default":false,"description":""},{"id":3815127807,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAlosUs7jZjr_","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/doc","name":"doc","color":"6f9eaf","default":false,"description":"Namespace

SUMMARY\r\n<img width=\"344\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-04-25 at 12 17 23 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/487433/c94a1da6-143e-440c-b6eb-d3db012332f9\">\r\n\r\nRecently I realized that much of the content in CONTRIBUTING.md was\r\nduplicated in `docs/docs/contributing`, and had evloved into much of a\r\ncomplicated patchwork of semi-useful content.\r\n\r\nHow I approached it:\r\n- decided to make CONTRIBUTING.md a simple pointer to the documentation\r\n  website\r\n- merged all information into `docs/docs/contributing`, tried to take\r\n  the more complete where docs had been copy/pasted\r\n- review the big sub-section into a more comprehensive set\r\n  - Contibuting to Superset: high level info and orientation\r\n  - Guidelines: how we approach guidelines, conventions, and interactions\r\n  - Setting up a dev envrionemnt\r\n  - Development how-tos\r\n  - Resources: for things like ERD, arch diagrams, ...\r\n  - Misc.: catch all for all the rest of things that don't fit anywhere\r\n- I re-did the top part of \"Setting up a dev envrionemnt\", as things\r\n  were confusing and wanted to point more directly to docker-compose as\r\n  the main supported method\r\n- various edits\r\n\r\nThere's more work to be done here, but this seems much saner and much\r\nmore manageable.\r\n","created_at":"2024-04-25T19:16:43Z","updated_at":"2024-11-27T01:43:45Z","closed_at":"2024-04-27T00:49:21Z","merged_at":"2024-04-27T00:49:21Z","merge_commit_sha":"a08c24c4aaf7b869eb7820aad2189f1a9bbdb674","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1332384320,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzMyMzg0MzIw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/size/XXL","name":"size/XXL","color":"5A30DA","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2630106047,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjMwMTA2MDQ3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/preset-io","name":"preset-io","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":3815127807,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAlosUs7jZjr_","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/doc","name":"doc","color":"6f9eaf","default":false,"description":"Namespace

granting `all_database_access`, one would expect to get access to all charts and datasets.\r\n\r\nFrom my understanding `all_database_access` is practically identical to `all_datasource_access`, and perhaps the two perms should be collapsed into one. In the meantime, this addresses user confusion around this perm not working according to its name.\r\n\r\nI'm guessing that the difference between the two could be that `all_database_access` would also allow you to CRUD database objects(?)\r\n\r\nSide mission:\r\n\r\nIntroducing a nifty context manager for tests to create temp user:\r\n```python \r\nwith self.temporary_user(clone_user=gamma_user, extra_pvms=[('all_database_access', 'all_database_access')],login=True) as user:\r\n    user.do_stuff()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe neat thing is it can clone a user, will delete it on exit, optionally can log user in/out. It's not mutating anything so it should work well for running tests in parallel and/or for tests that fail half way through.\r\n\r\nI'm planning on a follow up refactoring PR to standardize on using `temporary_user` everywhere where the current create_user is used.","created_at":"2024-04-24T22:02:14Z","updated_at":"2024-11-27T01:43:07Z","closed_at":"2024-05-02T16:25:14Z","merged_at":"2024-05-02T16:25:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"513852b7c3987a191386e88c0ebc1f4fd7943fad","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1331560260,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzMxNTYwMjYw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/size/L","name":"size/L","color":"6D53B9","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2630106047,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjMwMTA2MDQ3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/preset-io","name":"preset-io","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":6578403540,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAlosUs8AAAABiBp41A","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/%F0%9F%8F%B7%EF%B8%8F%20bot","name":"🏷️

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nContinuing the work on deprecating/removing server side rendered pages, this adds a new React/Antd Form and backend API for Columnar uploads.\r\n\r\nLeverages the work already done on: https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/28164, https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/28105, https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/27840\r\n\r\nColumnar upload will accept ZIP files and parquet files.\r\n\r\nA refactor was done on CSV and Excel upload, with this PR the initial parsing of the data file to get metadata info such as columns and sheet names was being done on the frontend, now we send the file to the backend to fetch it's metadata info. This is more maintainable and scalable since we avoid code duplication to parse data files, avoid having to add a new frontend dependencies for each file type, avoid blocking the UI while the file is being parsed.\r\nAlthough we send the entire file to the backend, by using pandas or pyarrow we can avoid having to parse the entire file, so I expect this operation to be relatively lightweight.\r\n\r\n3 new endpoints are added to fetch data files metadata:\r\n`api/v1/database/csv_upload_metadata`\r\n`api/v1/database/excel_upload_metadata`\r\n`api/v1/database/columnar_upload_metadata`\r\n\r\nPermission names for these endpoints are the same as their counterparts, so `csv_upload on Database`, `excel_upload on Database` and `columnar_upload on Database`\r\n\r\nPossibly a single endpoint to upload data and a single endpoint to fetch metadata would be sufficient, but that would imply a single permission for all file types, and that's a breaking change.\r\nI think that a single permission and only 2 REST API endpoints is better, so having granular permissions for each file type is not actually required. I'll add a v5 breaking item if everyone agrees.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/assets/4025227/60d69306-4990-4668-a096-80f9b4106bbd\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!
