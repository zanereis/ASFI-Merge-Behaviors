Support metrics grouped by scope labels in MAL, no need global labels as before\r\n- [ ] If this is non-trivial feature, paste the links/URLs to the design doc.\r\n- [ ] Update the documentation to include this new feature.\r\n- [x] Tests(including UT, IT, E2E) are added to verify the new feature.\r\n- [ ] If it's UI related, attach the screenshots below.\r\n\r\n- [ ] If this pull request closes/resolves/fixes an existing issue, replace the issue number. Closes #<issue number>.\r\n- [x] Update the [`CHANGES` log](https://github.com/apache/skywalking/blob/master/CHANGES.md).\r\n\r\nFor example, the metrics data as below:\r\n```\r\nsamples=[\r\nSample(name=null, labels={idc=t1}, value=50.0, timestamp=0), \r\nSample(name=null, labels={idc=t3, region=cn, svc=catalog}, value=51.0, timestamp=0),\r\nSample(name=null, labels={idc=t1, region=us, svc=product}, value=50.0, timestamp=0), \r\nSample(name=null, labels={idc=t1, region=us, instance=10.0.0.1}, value=100.0, timestamp=0), \r\nSample(name=null, labels={idc=t3, region=cn, instance=10.0.0.1}, value=3.0, timestamp=0)\r\n]\r\n```\r\nThe rule is `http_success_request.sum(['idc']).service(['idc'])`\r\n\r\nAs before，\r\nMAL would match the label `idc` value `t1` as the `serviceName` set to `MeterEntity` from the **first** sample. Obviously it‘s lost `t3` as another `serviceName` and `MeterEntity`. MAL can't support this scenario unless all samples label `idc` value are `t1`.\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, \r\nMAL would group the samples by scope labels, mapping the grouped samples to different `MeterEntity`.\r\nMore scenario can see the testcase code in `ScopeTest.java`\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-03-05T09:42:03Z","updated_at":"2021-03-17T01:47:15Z","closed_at":"2021-03-17T01:02:38Z","merged_at":"2021-03-17T01:02:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"a8810b1ab0b50fe439bc14517281fca7e82489b2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"mrproliu","id":3417650,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTc2NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3417650?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrproliu","html_url":"https://github.com/mrproliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrproliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrproliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrproliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrproliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrproliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrproliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrproliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrproliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrproliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"kezhenxu94","id":15965696,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTY1Njk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15965696?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94","html_url":"https://github.com/kezhenxu94","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":783582051,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3ODM1ODIwNTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/labels/core%20feature","name":"core feature","color":"5319e7","default":false,"description":"Core and important feature.

app ran into an endless FullGC state some days before. After some analysis, I found this.\r\nWhen Dubbo RPC Chain acts like: A-->dubbo://B-->dubbo://C, and in some situation server C slow down or suddenly crush, Dubbo-thread(Provider) on Server B may triggers an 'Consumer is shutting down' Exception, org.apache.dubbo.rpc.AsyncRpcResult.getAppResponse won't get any result(dubbo code notes: '// This should not happen in normal request process;').\r\nThen result.getException in afterMethod throws exception in Skywalking java agent as below(won't log into span.log):\r\n\r\n> ERROR 2021-01-27 15:06:19:290 Dubbo-thread-388 InstMethodsInter : class[class org.apache.dubbo.monitor.support.MonitorFilter] after method[invoke] intercept failure\r\n> org.apache.dubbo.rpc.RpcException: java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Consumer is shutting down and this call is going to be stopped without receiving any result, usually this is called by a slow provider instance or bad service implementation.\r\n  >    at org.apache.dubbo.rpc.AsyncRpcResult.getAppResponse(AsyncRpcResult.java:148)\r\n  >    at org.apache.dubbo.rpc.AsyncRpcResult.getException(AsyncRpcResult.java:107)\r\n  >    at org.apache.skywalking.apm.plugin.asf.dubbo.DubboInterceptor.afterMethod(DubboInterceptor.java:110)\r\n  >    at org.apache.skywalking.apm.agent.core.plugin.interceptor.enhance.InstMethodsInter.intercept(InstMethodsInter.java:97)\r\n  >    at org.apache.dubbo.monitor.support.MonitorFilter.invoke(MonitorFilter.java)\r\n  >    at org.apache.dubbo.rpc.protocol.ProtocolFilterWrapper$1.invoke(ProtocolFilterWrapper.java:81)\r\n  >    at org.apache.dubbo.rpc.protocol.dubbo.filter.FutureFilter.invoke(FutureFilter.java:49)\r\n  >    at org.apache.dubbo.rpc.protocol.ProtocolFilterWrapper$1.invoke(ProtocolFilterWrapper.java:81)\r\n\r\nStopSpan() won't work, TraceSegment will be kept by ThreadLocal when dubbo runs in threadpool mode.\r\nWhile this thread creating new entryspans later, the old TraceSegment will be added into refs.(memory leak)\r\n\r\nThis is a JVM heapdump after the memory leak happened for several days(the thread is holding 768332 spans):\r\n![mat](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8132268/108948485-8a781280-769d-11eb-97ea-5121996ec2fa.png)\r\n\r\nI thinks maybe there are some 'unnormal' RpcExceptions which can't be obtained by result.getException(). Perhaps we could catch them when calling it from afterMethod.\r\nBuilt an new dubbo-2.7.x-plugin on my machine and it looks good now.\r\n\r\n<!-- ==== 🔌 Remove this line WHEN AND ONLY WHEN you're adding a new plugin, follow the checklist 👇 ====\r\n### Add an agent plugin to support <framework name>\r\n- [ ] Add a test case for the new plugin, refer to [the doc](https://github.com/apache/skywalking/blob/master/docs/en/guides/Plugin-test.md)\r\n- [ ] Add a component id in [the component-libraries.yml](https://github.com/apache/skywalking/blob/master/oap-server/server-bootstrap/src/main/resources/component-libraries.yml)\r\n- [ ] Add a logo in [the UI repo](https://github.com/apache/skywalking-rocketbot-ui/tree/master/src/views/components/topology/assets)\r\n     ==== 🔌 Remove this line WHEN AND ONLY WHEN you're adding a new plugin, follow the checklist 👆 ==== -->\r\n\r\n<!-- ==== 📈 Remove this line WHEN AND ONLY WHEN you're improving the performance, follow the checklist 👇 ====\r\n### Improve the performance of <class or module or ...>\r\n- [ ] Add a benchmark for the improvement, refer to [the existing ones](https://github.com/apache/skywalking/blob/master/apm-commons/apm-datacarrier/src/test/java/org/apache/skywalking/apm/commons/datacarrier/LinkedArrayBenchmark.java)\r\n- [ ] The benchmark result.\r\n```text\r\n<Paste the benchmark results here>\r\n```\r\n- [ ] Links/URLs to the theory proof or discussion articles/blogs. <links/URLs here>\r\n     ==== 📈 Remove this line WHEN AND ONLY WHEN you're improving the performance, follow the checklist 👆 ==== -->\r\n\r\n<!-- ==== 🆕 Remove this line WHEN AND ONLY WHEN you're adding a new feature, follow the checklist 👇 ====\r\n### <Feature description>\r\n- [ ] If this is non-trivial feature, paste the links/URLs to the design doc.\r\n- [ ] Update the documentation to include this new feature.\r\n- [ ] Tests(including UT, IT, E2E) are added to verify the new feature.\r\n- [ ] If it's UI related, attach the screenshots below.\r\n     ==== 🆕 Remove this line WHEN AND ONLY WHEN you're adding a new feature, follow the checklist 👆 ==== -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] If this pull request closes/resolves/fixes an existing issue, replace the issue number.
