PR adds a new function `columnNames()` which takes a `Frame` and returns a `Frame` containing the names of the columns.\r\nI did not yet add any documentation since I am not aware of the current process. Should documentation be added in the initial PR? Should a new PR be made just for documentation of this function? Is documentation added in bulk?\r\nI also detected that the functions `typeOf` and `detectSchema`, which belong to the same \"category\" (instruction type) as this function are defined in `src/main/java/org/apache/sysds/runtime/functionobjects/Builtin.java`, but I believe those definitions are not used. Am I overlooking something and this function should be added

PR resolves an Issue I've had for some time in the testing. It comes with a some changes in the system behavior, and improves the testing experience. \r\nThis PR, has dependencies on #980 (Merge that first!)\r\n\r\nHere is a list:\r\n\r\n- When calling `runTest` in `AutomatedTestBase` the Std out is caught from when the system is initialized through `DMLScript.main`, This results in a `ByteArrayOutputStream` that is returned, by overwriting the java `System.out`. After the test is executed the standard `System.out` is reinstated. This change improves the ability to check for certain print statements executed in the DML script, while also keeping the Test from printing to console, and in turn crashing our regression tests on GitHub(because of to much printing).\r\n- If a test fails, the standard output is then directed to the error message returned from the systems output from the failing test reducing the amount of text to sift through to find the failing tests output.\r\n- Another major change is that the system now when calling `DMLScript.main` returns exceptions instead of writing them to `System.err`. This should have no impact on user experience because they still get the entire stack trace as before, but it makes it easier for debugging, and testing for specific Exception types that are not handled inside the system.\r\n\r\n- A minor change that was in the initial direction this Branch went is NAN handling. This has resulting in this PR also containing a change in the mtd file flag for NAN values to change from 'na.string' to 'naString'. To enable an new argument `naString` when reading csv files in subsequent PRs since `.` is not allowed in variable names or argument names.\r\n\r\n**ISSUE**

adds functionality for a federated recode transform. The resulting matrix will also be federated. \r\nCurrently none of the other transform modes are supported and will result in failure (note: WIP). The decode works, but it is not a federated operation, instead the federated matrices are just sent back to the master and a local decode is executed.\r\nThis is again is quite a large PR so an early look (@Baunsgaard ?) would be appreciated while I continue to adapt things to support other encodings.\r\nFederated decode will be done in a separate PR.\r\n\r\nI already added the initial privacy features, but @sebwrede you might want to take a closer look since the current recode implementation leaks all the distinct values of columns to the master which could be reason for another level of privacy.","created_at":"2020-06-08T16:10:07Z","updated_at":"2020-08-13T20:22:42Z","closed_at":"2020-08-13T20:22:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3077b45af97587b63bf5446b68141fdf1f2079ab","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/966/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/966/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/966/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/statuses/4e106c9bd5529d99c60acc9deff569f64c197f3b","head":{"label":"kev-inn:new_federated_transform","ref":"new_federated_transform","sha":"4e106c9bd5529d99c60acc9deff569f64c197f3b","user":{"login":"kev-inn","id":41760497,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNzYwNDk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41760497?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kev-inn","html_url":"https://github.com/kev-inn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kev-inn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kev-inn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kev-inn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kev-inn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kev-inn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kev-inn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kev-inn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kev-inn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kev-inn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":251581266,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNTE1ODEyNjY=","name":"systemml","full_name":"kev-inn/systemml","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kev-inn","id":41760497,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNzYwNDk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41760497?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kev-inn","html_url":"https://github.com/kev-inn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kev-inn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kev-inn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kev-inn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kev-inn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kev-inn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kev-inn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kev-inn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kev-inn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kev-inn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kev-inn/systemml","description":"Mirror

pull request adds documentation for builtin intersect function\r\n\r\n## `intersect`-Function\r\n\r\nThis is a generic function, extended from the intersect function in the base package. The elements of intersect(x,y) are those elements in x and in y. \r\nThe original definition is preserved in the case that x and y are vectors of the same mode.\r\n \r\n ### Usage\r\n ```r\r\nintersect(x, y)\r\n\r\n ```\r\n \r\n ### Arguments\r\n | Name    | Type           | Default  | Description |\r\n | :------ | :------------- | -------- | :---------- |\r\n | X       | Matrix[Double] | --       | a set of matrix A |\r\n | Y       | Matrix[Double] | --       | a set of matrix B | \r\n \r\n### Returns\r\n| Type           | Description |\r\n| :------------- | :---------- |\r\n| Matrix[Double] | intersection matrix, set of intersecting items|\r\n\r\n### Example\r\n```\r\nintersect = function(Matrix[Double] X, Matrix[Double] Y)\r\n  return(Matrix[Double] A)\r\n{\r\nX = rand (rows = 50, cols = 10)\r\nY = rand (rows = 50, cols = 20)\r\ny = X %*% rand(rows=ncol(X), 1)\r\ny = Y\r\nintersect(X,Y)\r\n```\r\n","created_at":"2020-06-06T03:42:28Z","updated_at":"2020-06-14T04:54:41Z","closed_at":"2020-06-14T04:44:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"782b05e372d9277499098a0b0da38147d97eacb3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/954/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/954/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/954/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/statuses/e89fc66f5f21c055732d3dccc0f0f79b498da565","head":{"label":"t201:intersect-doc","ref":"intersect-doc","sha":"e89fc66f5f21c055732d3dccc0f0f79b498da565","user":{"login":"t201","id":54388379,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0Mzg4Mzc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54388379?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/t201","html_url":"https://github.com/t201","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t201/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t201/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t201/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t201/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t201/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t201/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t201/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t201/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t201/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":267028897,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjcwMjg4OTc=","name":"systemds","full_name":"t201/systemds","private":false,"owner":{"login":"t201","id":54388379,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0Mzg4Mzc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54388379?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/t201","html_url":"https://github.com/t201","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t201/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t201/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t201/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t201/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t201/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t201/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t201/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t201/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/t201/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/t201/systemds","description":"Mirror

The function returns an intersection matrix which is knows as the set of the resultant set of the two intersecting matrices.\r\n \r\n ### Usage\r\n ```r\r\nm_intersect = function(Matrix[Double] X, Matrix[Double] Y)\r\n ```\r\n \r\n ### Arguments\r\n | Name    | Type           | Default  | Description |\r\n | :------ | :------------- | -------- | :---------- |\r\n | X       | Matrix[Double] | --       | matrix X, set A  |\r\n | Y       | Matrix[Double] | --       | matrix Y, set B |\r\n\r\n### Returns\r\n| Type           | Description |\r\n| :------------- | :---------- |\r\n| Matrix[Double] | intersection matrix, set of intersecting items|\r\n\r\n### Example\r\n```\r\nm_intersect = function(Matrix[Double] X, Matrix[Double] Y)\r\n  return(Matrix[Double] R)\r\n{\r\n  # compute indicator vector of intersection output\r\n  X = (table(X, 1) != 0) \r\n  Y = (table(Y, 1) != 0)\r\n  n = min(nrow(X), nrow(Y))\r\n  I = X[1:n,] * Y[1:n,]\r\n\r\n  # reconstruct integer values and create output\r\n  R = removeEmpty(target=seq(1,n), margin=\"rows\", select=I)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n![Screenshot

patch contains handling of multiple cache entries pointing to the\r\nsame data (due to multilevel caching).\r\n 1) All the entries with the same values are connected with a linkedlist. Even though\r\n they output same data, they have different computation time.\r\n 2) Eviction logic marks an entry for deferred spilling/removal if other\r\n entries are linked to that. If all the entries in a list are marked for\r\n spilling or removal, only then we evict the item.\r\n 3) Disk write and read happen only once for all the items connected to a\r\n single matrix. This way single read and write restores multiple entries\r\n to cache and clears more space respectively.\r\n 4) Initial experiments show huge improvements in cache management. Now\r\n the cache can store many more entries (this patch fixes duplicate size\r\n calculations), need reduced number of disk I/O. These changes overall improve\r\n cache hit count.","created_at":"2020-05-31T22:12:23Z","updated_at":"2020-06-01T20:57:37Z","closed_at":"2020-06-01T20:57:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c8b26133db8c266646650d1ec45b017881c7f14d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/932/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/932/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/932/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/statuses/2c221c2e0806fb102eb7d210ad01ca6effa3dca8","head":{"label":"phaniarnab:lincost6","ref":"lincost6","sha":"2c221c2e0806fb102eb7d210ad01ca6effa3dca8","user":{"login":"phaniarnab","id":4302361,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMDIzNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4302361?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab","html_url":"https://github.com/phaniarnab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":251259626,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNTEyNTk2MjY=","name":"systemds","full_name":"phaniarnab/systemds","private":false,"owner":{"login":"phaniarnab","id":4302361,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMDIzNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4302361?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab","html_url":"https://github.com/phaniarnab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phaniarnab/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/phaniarnab/systemds","description":"Mirror

patch fixes remaining issues of incorrect results for colMins and\r\ncolMaxs over compressed matrix blocks with shared DDC1 dictionaries.\r\nSpecifically, if the individual column groups have only partial overlap,\r\nthe shared dictionary contains a superset of column group distinct\r\nvalues. Since aggregation functions like min and max are executed only\r\nover the dictionary (without touching the compressed data), it led to\r\nincorrect results as we find extreme values that do not actually exist\r\nin the column group.\r\n\r\nThree alternatives approaches could solve this: (1) drop shared\r\ndictionaries, (2) execute colMins and colMaxs over the compressed data,\r\nor (3) refactor the double array dictionary into a proper class\r\nhierarchy and maintain additional meta data for shared dictionaries. We\r\ndecided for (3) in order to keep predictable performance, irrespective\r\nof shared dictionaries and because this class hierarchy allows for\r\nfurther improvements of shared dictionaries between any subsets of\r\ncolumn groups.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this fix also cleanups incorrect estimates of the\r\nindividual column groups (because getValueSize was used in the estimates\r\nas a number of values, although it gave the size in bytes) as well as\r\nsome of the Class-layout size estimation tests.","created_at":"2020-05-30T21:12:30Z","updated_at":"2020-05-31T16:28:09Z","closed_at":"2020-05-31T16:28:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"76f4b45f5a8345eb5f41cd5b9f9ca8464f3160f5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/927/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/927/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/issues/927/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/systemds/statuses/5dd970f68cf0da02e1235810f0eb1ac7afe0c30c","head":{"label":"mboehm7:compress_shared_dict","ref":"compress_shared_dict","sha":"5dd970f68cf0da02e1235810f0eb1ac7afe0c30c","user":{"login":"mboehm7","id":13721609,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzIxNjA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13721609?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7","html_url":"https://github.com/mboehm7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mboehm7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"405462e84ad1192e447bb09c03fe20d112bf6afb","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":45896813,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NTg5NjgxMw==","name":"systemds","full_name":"apache/systemds","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/systemds","description":"An
