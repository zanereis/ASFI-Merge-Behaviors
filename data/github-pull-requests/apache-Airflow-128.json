the bug\r\nazure key vault adds a - between the key prefix and the secret name when it reads it from the azure key vault. It does this even when the variables prefix is \"\" so secrets end up named -my-secret instead of my-secret.\r\n\r\nTo Reproduce\r\nFollow the instructions to set up an azure key vault integrated install with a variables_prefix of \"\".\r\nCreate a secret named -my-var in the azure key vault.\r\nUse the example dag provided in the docs with Variable.get(\"my-var\")\r\nYou will see that it fetches the variable because it is incorrectly mapping my-var to -my-var instead of my-var.\r\n\r\nExpected Behaviour\r\nconnections_prefix and variables_prefix don't add a leading - when they are set to \"\".\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

But this hinders the standard workflow of the Kubernetes executor and Kubernetes Pod Operator. It is because both of them use the Pod Phase to determine the status of the dag task. Airflow will consider that the task is finished when the Pod Phase is successful and failed. Because of the istio-proxy sidecar, the pod will always be running. Just the task container itself is completed. This will lead to the Pod Phase become Not Ready in the success task, and Error in the failed task. In Airflow UI, you will see the task always running and never-ending.\r\n\r\nThe best way is to implement an Istio Kubernetes Pod Operator that shut down the pod when the base container (the container that runs your task) is completed. It involves creating an Istio pod launcher.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

when a mapped task is being rendered (and unmapped during the process), the template context continues to reference the mapped task because the context is created before unmapping. This is however not useful, and creates obstacles for use cases needing to reference a task-mapping value (something passed to the expand function).\r\n\r\nThis patch adds logic to replace `context[\"task\"]` and `context[\"ti\"].task` in-place when a mapped task is being unmapped, so they always reference an unmapped task during template rendering. This makes writing a Jinja template for a mapped task more consistent to that for a non-mapped one.\r\n\r\nTo accommodate this change in reference, some peripheral code is modified so various task variables point to the right things at the right moment. A few tests are also modified to ensure this in-place replacement is done at the right moment.\r\n\r\nFix

successful.","created_at":"2022-09-26T20:49:34Z","updated_at":"2022-09-27T01:42:44Z","closed_at":"2022-09-26T23:06:03Z","merged_at":"2022-09-26T23:06:03Z","merge_commit_sha":"2f86e6d3a2184a0bca3fadab61e9589461a2ebc9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1697155831,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjk3MTU1ODMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:providers","name":"area:providers","color":"d4c5f9","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/26685/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/26685/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/26685/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/28cb401633799ffb3881ad718aeeed787a480274","head":{"label":"pauldalewilliams:fix-sftpoperator-tests","ref":"fix-sftpoperator-tests","sha":"28cb401633799ffb3881ad718aeeed787a480274","user":{"login":"pauldalewilliams","id":18008700,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDA4NzAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18008700?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pauldalewilliams","html_url":"https://github.com/pauldalewilliams","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pauldalewilliams/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pauldalewilliams/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pauldalewilliams/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pauldalewilliams/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pauldalewilliams/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pauldalewilliams/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pauldalewilliams/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pauldalewilliams/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pauldalewilliams/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":496754881,"node_id":"R_kgDOHZvgwQ","name":"airflow","full_name":"pauldalewilliams/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"pauldalewilliams","id":18008700,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDA4NzAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18008700?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pauldalewilliams","html_url":"https://github.com/pauldalewilliams","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pauldalewilliams/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pauldalewilliams/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pauldalewilliams/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pauldalewilliams/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pauldalewilliams/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pauldalewilliams/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pauldalewilliams/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pauldalewilliams/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pauldalewilliams/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/pauldalewilliams/airflow","description":"Apache

https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/14529\r\n\r\nIf you check at the issue thread, you will notice that there is quite a few concerns/inherent complexity to properly achieve TaskGroup clearing. (especially @potiuk who raised fair concerns about db deadlocks and topological order resolution for clearing tasks).\r\n\r\nThis implements a simple 'POC', I was able to successfully clear simple and nested task group.\r\n\r\nThe function clearing tasks handles multiple tasks into one single transaction and seems pretty fast even on moderate dag size . This code finds the requested `TaskGroup` for clearing, recursively find all child tasks, then extract the partial_subset, and clear all those tasks.\r\n\r\n~~Note: I also had to update the `check-init-decorator-arguments` static check as `ast.unparse` was introduced in python 3.9.

order to avoid initialisation of database and other integrations when you are entering/leaving breeze, those are started when breeze starts but not stopped when you leave. Then stopping such running auxiliary containers should be done with `breeze stop` after you are done. However those who do not do it, and will restart their machine will find that the containers get restarted.\r\n\r\nThis has been added as part of #13446 where health-checks are added.

for how it handles non-existent file.\r\n\r\nWhen the file path received doesn't exist, the current way is to use yaml.safe_load() to process it, and it returns the path as a string.\r\n\r\nThen this string is passed to deserialize_model_dict() and results in an empty object. Passing 'None' to deserialize_model_dict() will do the same, but the code will become clearer, and less misleading.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, when the model file path received doesn't exist, there should be a warning in the log.\r\n\r\n(This change shouldn't cause any behaviour change)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

workflow team from Pinterest has been always using Kubernetes Executor. We met the scheduler performance issue before since:\r\n- Kubernetes Executor is on the critical path of Scheduler heartbeat.\r\n- All the items in queues within the Kubernetes Executor are done sequentially. The process is not efficient.\r\n- Especially that processing task_queue will call k8s api to create pods, which is causing more delay.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we implemented the multi-threads support for processing diff queues in Kubernetes Executor. Based on our observation, it's able to \r\n- reduce the time cost from minutes level to seconds level when syncing about several hundreds of items in one round.\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce this is agreed, then I can start adding unit test cases as well.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-23T18:48:20Z","updated_at":"2023-04-15T00:11:43Z","closed_at":"2023-04-15T00:11:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c1589f9020932cd3deb1ec3bba1ab4374f3f9115","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"jedcunningham","id":66968678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2OTY4Njc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66968678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham","html_url":"https://github.com/jedcunningham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

is useful for cases where we want to resolve an XCom without running a worker, e.g. to display the value in UI, logs, and OpenLineage.\r\n\r\nSince we don't want to actually call the mapper function in this case (the function is arbitrary code, and not running it is the entire point to serialize operators), \"resolving\" the XComArg in this case would merely produce some kind of quasi-meaningful string representation,\r\ninstead of the actual value we'd get in the worker.\r\n\r\nAlso note that this only affects a very small number of cases, since once a worker is run for the task instance, RenderedTaskInstanceFields would store the real resolved value and take over UI representation, avoiding this fake resolving logic to be accessed at all.","created_at":"2022-09-22T11:48:36Z","updated_at":"2022-09-23T20:33:13Z","closed_at":"2022-09-23T20:33:01Z","merged_at":"2022-09-23T20:33:01Z","merge_commit_sha":"3e01c0d97aeefce303e1fdb5cef160f192cce4fa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2172803017,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcyODAzMDE3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:bug-fix","name":"type:bug-fix","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog:
