will greatly speed up our time to release (now docker artifacts will be the bottleneck, though we could do something similar for them if needed\r\n\r\n- Example of this running on a non-rc - https://github.com/apache/beam/actions/runs/10516450029 - technically used some extra compute, but all the (empty) RC stages took <30 seconds, **takes 3.5 hours**\r\nExample of this running on a (fake) RC - RC faked with https://github.com/apache/beam/commit/1048b6e1b7b4dac47538af649d5dc63c857a50b6 - https://github.com/apache/beam/actions/runs/10516478683 - **takes 5 hours**. I expect this may be on the higher end since the RC wheels themselves took quite long despite being the same as the normal wheels, which took 4 hours. Still is an improvement regardless, but hopefully it will be more like <4 hours in general. It should also be driven down when we deprecate python 3.8\r\nExample of running without this change on an RC - https://github.com/apache/beam/actions/runs/10408455748 - **takes 7 hours**\r\n\r\nFixes #32217\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

a flag --idle_shutdown_timeout to avoid SDKs leaving dangling prism processes after a job terminates.\r\n\r\n* Operates simply: Tracks the number of terminations, and compares to the number of started jobs. If they're equal, then start the idle timer.\r\n* Timer is cleared if there's a new job.\r\n* Initial timer set on start of prism process.\r\n* Currently only actively running jobs extend the timeout, and other actions (eg. via Job management) do *not* extend the timeout.\r\n* Negative durations do not idle shutdown.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR closes #31967, closes #31935, and closes #31935 with a Java Prism Runner.\r\n\r\n- Resolves, downloads and executes Prism via PrismLocator/Executor\r\n- Wraps PipelineResult methods delegating to the portability module's JobServicePipelineResult\r\n- Refactors numerous faulty closures in the portability, harness modules; some still remain\r\n- Detects whether run invoked within a Test class in the stack and invokes waitUntilFinish\r\n\r\nCurrently there's a limitation that the one has to look at the gradle output for whether the test passed as the Job failure isn't getting caught.

bytes sent over the State API Writer. Eagerly nil the buffer if it's at zero length.\r\n\r\n* stateKeyWriter wasn't implementing the io.Writer interface correctly, as it was retaining a reference to the passed in byte slice.\r\n* This, combined with the escape analysis subversion function (ioutilx.WriteUnsafe), and a change in Go 1.23 made a data corruption more likely, as the underlying memory for the byte slice was used for other things. \r\n* This largely only happened sometimes because state is written to asynchronously over 3 goroutines (user, writer, reader, with user blocking until the reader confirms the write response).\r\n\r\nA better fix would be to avoid the WriteUnsafe hack altogether, but that leads to an egregious number of small allocations, hurting performance, and would be much wider in scope to change.\r\n\r\nEagerly nilling a zero length read buffer avoid an extra round trip to the state reader to first return a 0 length read, before requesting more bytes or returning io.EOF.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

an unsafe delete option to be used for garbage collection of multi_process_shared objects. This allows cleanup of multiprocess objects even if some references have been entirely lost (e.g. due to running in a subprocess mode) or if its unclear when they'll be invoked again (because Beam may not schedule work to that DoFn for a bit).\r\n\r\nThis is intentionally unsafe and should only be used when other synchronization mechanisms are in place to prevent usage of the already deleted object. For example, this will be used as part of our runinference timeout feature - for more details see  https://docs.google.com/document/d/19ves6iv-m_6DFmePJZqYpLm-bCooPu6wQ-Ti6kAl2Jo/edit#heading=h.cfdh3ijyabi3\r\n\r\nPart of #32137\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

documenting the broad strokes of the watermark evaluation Goroutine, it became clear that the field \"watermarkRefreshes\" while accurate, was unclear. Renamed to be what they contain, stages that have changed, rather than what it's for, which is knowing which stages need a watermark refresh.\r\n\r\nWatermark refresh now refers cleanly to the action, rather than the pending action as a result of other work. This should make it a bit easier to follow in the code.\r\n\r\n\"We evaluate changed stages for watermark advancement with the `refreshWatermarks()` method.\" compared to\r\n\"We process watermark refreshes in the `refreshWatermarks()` method.\"\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

fixes metrics from the Java SDK when running in Loopback mode against Prism (and probably a few other usecases too).\r\n\r\n* The Provision API is usually called by the container bootloader to initialize the worker.\r\n* Without calling the ProvisionAPI, the worker doesn't know a runner's capabilities.\r\n* This lead to the Java SDK to send old style metrics in loopback mode, which prism doesn't support.\r\n* That meant there were no metrics being propagated at in the UI.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

The new release of wazero v1.8.0 has arrived 🎉 🏝️☀️ 🍺</p>\n<p>This release has happened intentionally right after the Go 1.23 release. <a href=\"https://github.com/ncruces\"><code>@​ncruces</code></a> worked so hard (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/issues/2301\">#2301</a>), and\nupdated our codebase to make it up-to-date with the new Go versions. Notably, since this release,\n<strong>we set our floor Go version to 1.21 (-2 from the latest) following our support policy</strong>.</p>\n<p>The following is the brief summary of what's included in this release!</p>\n<h2>Experimental feature: importResolver</h2>\n<p>A new wazero friend <a href=\"https://github.com/bep\"><code>@​bep</code></a> from  the Hugo community came up with an exciting way to &quot;link&quot; modules dynamically/anonymously,\nwhich we call &quot;ImportResolver&quot;. The feature was implemented in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/issues/2298\">#2298</a>, and available under experimental package.\nIf you are interested please give it a shot, and give us your feedback!</p>\n<h2>Emscripten update</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/jerbob92\"><code>@​jerbob92</code></a> found out that a breaking change was introduced in Emscripten 3.1.57+, and worked to make our emscripten\npackage to support these recent versions. Unfortunately, the older emscriptens are not supported anymore, so users\nare encouraged to update their Emscripten version. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/issues/2290\">#2290</a></p>\n<h2>Bug fixes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>threads: lock around invocations of memory.Grow (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/issues/2279\">#2279</a>) <a href=\"https://github.com/anuraaga\"><code>@​anuraaga</code></a></li>\n<li>amd64: fixes lowerSqmulRoundSat (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/issues/2260\">#2260</a>) <a href=\"https://github.com/mathetake\"><code>@​mathetake</code></a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Compilation perf improvements</h2>\n<p>Just like the recent previous releases, <a href=\"https://github.com/mathetake\"><code>@​mathetake</code></a> worked hard to make compilation faster.\nUnfortunately, we don't have a concrete number to showcase here, but both Interpreter and Compiler\nengines now runs really faster compared to the previous releases during compilation without affecting the runtime performance.</p>\n<p>If you are interested in the latest updates and discussion around this topic, feel free to follow the thread  in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/issues/2182\">#2182</a>.</p>\n<h2>Others</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update Benthos to Redpanda Connect (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/issues/2291\">#2291</a>) <a href=\"https://github.com/rockwotj\"><code>@​rockwotj</code></a></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/commit/5ed4c174cce718e1655d4e1cb95e2611d1a29e73\"><code>5ed4c17</code></a> ci: upgrade to Go 1.23 (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/issues/2301\">#2301</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/commit/2b12e189eeec0e4f2968e974cf25419bcb071b34\"><code>2b12e18</code></a> Improves ImportResolver example (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/issues/2299\">#2299</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/commit/a186448de5542d0c6d1335590998162cab9bea7a\"><code>a186448</code></a> Add experimental ImportResolver (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/issues/2298\">#2298</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/commit/5ad3f0631d762080cfa977a5c6667d6a8f9684b9\"><code>5ad3f06</code></a> doc: adds comments on simultaneous compilation (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/issues/2295\">#2295</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/commit/22b92a5556a65e3c4ed1a7bd62e6f3d80a4af315\"><code>22b92a5</code></a> Update Benthos to Redpanda Connect (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/issues/2291\">#2291</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/commit/c345ddf2b5d65f69ee4daa1bb49fe896d1306778\"><code>c345ddf</code></a> Add support for Emscripten version 3.1.57 (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/issues/2290\">#2290</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/commit/c077eabacdefd3fbeebd3b2461fb479a330afeb5\"><code>c077eab</code></a> ci: tests with Go 1.23rc2 (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/issues/2277\">#2277</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/commit/9a19a04962881134301ddedf7dc84c50004dbedf\"><code>9a19a04</code></a> backend: stop allocating ValueDefinitions (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/issues/2288\">#2288</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/commit/e2db5acda7c80e8ce3c364239551cbd896cd31a9\"><code>e2db5ac</code></a> backend: removes unnecessary ValueDefinition fields (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/issues/2287\">#2287</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/commit/2c53c6b5a31b5f1bc94add5a0b14224b85fc9f98\"><code>2c53c6b</code></a> ssa: removes valueIDToInstruction slice (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/issues/2286\">#2286</a>)</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/tetratelabs/wazero/compare/v1.7.3...v1.8.0\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=github.com/tetratelabs/wazero&package-manager=go_modules&previous-version=1.7.3&new-version=1.8.0)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

Side inputs, stateful `DoFn` and calling an external service can be used for accessing a cache. The Python SDK provide another option in the shared module, which can be more efficient than side inputs in terms of the amount of memory required and simpler than stateful `DoFn`.\r\n\r\nThe samples on this page show you how to use the Shared class of the [shared module](https://beam.apache.org/releases/pydoc/current/apache_beam.utils.shared.html) to enrich elements in both bounded and unbounded `PCollection`s\r\n\r\nIt supports this issue - https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/32177\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

implementations of string set and gauge metrics.\r\n\r\nThis allows the associated Validates runner tests to pass for Python (test_metrics) and the related tests for Java to pass.\r\n\r\nJava Attempted metrics failures (#31926) are to be handled in a different PR.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary to re-generate update the go protocol buffers to allow for StringSet, so that change has also been included in it's own commit. Most files are only updating a comment WRT which protocol buffer compiler is used.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/32184/files/a073e790713ca547eada875c75bbd8073bb634fa..77316d7b4d53c86f716015c44186c737e7171e8e for just the real code changes, that implement StringSet and Gauge metrics support inn prism.\r\n\r\nFixes #31927 and #31928\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
