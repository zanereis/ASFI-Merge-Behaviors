Such as a full-failing error(0% successful rate) and unhealthy(apdex=0) are not costing the storage.\r\n- Hour/Day dimensionalities metrics are not changed, as they cover long duration.\r\n- Fix `max` function in OAL doesn't support negative long.\r\n____\r\n\r\nThis optimization makes a side-effect, reported by @toffentoffen, the typical use case is shown in the demo env.\r\n![Screenshot 2022-07-12 at 11 39 11](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5441976/178534028-137a9494-f9cf-4d92-9d47-35c7c45e261d.png)\r\n\r\nThis service has only 66% success rate, but when you read the endpoint success rate list(DESC order), you can only see all are 100%. This is very confusing. \r\n**The root cause** is the above optimization, if an entity(in this case, an endpoint)'s success rate is 0%, the metric is not persistent. Then when we do topN aggregation query, there is no available data to list, even its success rate is pretty low.\r\nMeanwhile, if you query in hour/day level, it would show up, which makes ppl more confusing.\r\n\r\nSo, to keep things simpler, and as the success rate is the only metric that could be optimized through this PR, I am going to revert this optimization, and keep all aggregated metrics in the storage consistently.","created_at":"2022-07-12T15:51:41Z","updated_at":"2022-07-13T09:13:06Z","closed_at":"2022-07-13T00:02:46Z","merged_at":"2022-07-13T00:02:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"90b268e1109d24812410999c09fbaf1927f513e2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":783582051,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3ODM1ODIwNTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/labels/core%20feature","name":"core feature","color":"5319e7","default":false,"description":"Core and important feature.

Fix Scroll query in Elastic Search storage\r\nIf the `SW_STORAGE_ES_SCROLLING_BATCH_SIZE` environment config is less them the Service entity count, it would throw `No search context found for id` exception. The root cause is we're going to close the scroll after we've requested it once. \r\n\r\n### Add `profileDataQueryBatchSize` config in Elastic Search storage\r\nEBPF Profiling Data stores a large amount of symbol data. When a large amount of data content is queried at one time, a `ContentTooLargeException` from netty will occur, so I add a new config for the query. \r\n\r\n- [ ] If this pull request closes/resolves/fixes an existing issue, replace the issue number.
