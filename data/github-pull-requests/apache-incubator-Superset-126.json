The biggest change is brought about by bumping `werkzeug` from `0.16` to `1.0.1`, in which the `contrib.cache` module has been moved into its own PyPI package `cachelib`. The `sqlalchemy-utils` breaking change will need to be revisited later once the project decides on the appropriate path forward.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nLocal testing +

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nSuperset api limits records to 20 by default. @bkyryliuk recently opened a PR(https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/9667) to fix some of the owners dropdowns so that all records are returned by the api. The pr received some push back since changing the defaults probably isn't the best approach. This PR requests all records for the owners endpoints to fix the issue flagged in https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/9667. \r\n\r\nOriginally we intended to add pagination (via infinite scroll) and backend filtering. While trying to implement that approach I hit some limitations in react-select's async mode that caused me to reimplement fetching using react-select in non async mode, code is here: https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/9784/commits/90f7f79c3e8772385e726c1cd2bd3081ffadbc62\r\n\r\nAlso since there is currently an upgrade for react-select in progress (https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/9628) I opted for holding off on adding more complexity until the upgrade is complete. React select is fairly fast at searching and I don't think we should expect the owners list to be that large, so I'm not convinced that adding pagination will result in a more performant end user experience than fetching all records after mount and searching locally. \r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\n\r\n- [x] tested locally with 55 user

CATEGORY\r\n\r\nChoose one\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bug Fix\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (new features, refinement)\r\n- [X] Refactor\r\n- [X] Add tests\r\n- [ ] Build / Development Environment\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nThis change proposes to deprecate the current method to launch celery workers on tests. The aim is to push running tests using `docker-compose` defined infra on the root of the repo.\r\nA couple of changes were made to reach a fully functional yet simple test environment:\r\n\r\n- `docker-compose` will launch specific workers for tests.\r\n- Tests celery workers and dev celery workers don't share the same Redis DB. Test celery workers will use DB 2 and 3 for queue and results respectively.\r\n- Test celery workers use `test` DB on postgres\r\n\r\nThis is a step to run faster, more reliable, and closer to github actions env, tests.\r\n\r\n### Examples to run tests:\r\n\r\n- Run all tests with full init (resets test db, upgrades and loads examples):\r\n`./scripts/tests/run.sh tests`\r\n\r\n- Run just a single test with full init:\r\n`./scripts/tests/run.sh tests.celery_tests:CeleryTestCase.test_run_async_query_cta_config`\r\n\r\n- Run just a single test (with an already inited DB):\r\n`./scripts/tests/run.sh tests.celery_tests:CeleryTestCase.test_run_async_query_cta_config --no-init`\r\n\r\n- Using `tox`:\r\n``` bash\r\n./scripts/tests/run.sh . --reset-db\r\ntox -e py36-postgres\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Docker compose infra diagram:\r\n![celery tests](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4025227/81423573-8b5ea880-914c-11ea-9d34-88bcbd95d2a9.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Requires DB Migration.\r\n- [ ] Confirm DB Migration upgrade and downgrade tested.\r\n- [ ] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or API\r\n\r\n### REVIEWERS\r\n@willbarrett

CATEGORY\r\n\r\nChoose one\r\n\r\n- [x] Bug Fix\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (new features, refinement)\r\n- [ ] Refactor\r\n- [ ] Add tests\r\n- [ ] Build / Development Environment\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nWith the introduction of the new chart data API, support for force updating charts was temporarily lost. This updates the `@superset-ui/chart` and `@superset-ui/query` packages which recently added support for force updates ( https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui/pull/445 ) and adds the `force` property to `formData`, which is now properly deserialized by the new endpoint ( #9749 ).\r\n\r\n###

CATEGORY\r\n\r\n- [x] Refactor\r\n- [x] Build / Development Environment\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis changes all JS imports in `specs` to use absolute path, which makes the code a little bit easier to read and shall make rearranging the test files easier.\r\n\r\nAdded a `jsconfig.json` for VS Code so that intellisense can still work.\r\n\r\nAlso upgraded `prettier` to fix lint.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\nMake sure CI passes and other IDEs also have no problem using JS features.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n\r\n- [

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nContinuing to implement SIP-40, this time adding some of the backend logic. My plan is as follows:\r\n- Start replacing the `error` field in api responses with the `errors` list of SupersetError Objects\r\n- Support backwards compatibility on the frontend by pulling the message out of the `errors` list into the `error` field again\r\n- Provide the necessary info to the front end to render better error messages once designs are ready\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nNo ui changes\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nTest dashboards loading with and without errors in charts, see errors still render properly\r\nTest SQL Lab with and without query errors\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated

SUMMARY\r\nOn SQLLAb executing SQL statements with `CAST` and `AT` fail. This is a partial fix, since this seems to open up a bigger problem `sqlparse` does dot correctly identify columns with `CAST(FOO_COL AS TYPEX) AT TIME ZONE 'Eastern Standard Time'` for example, and just adds `CAST(FOO_OLD AS TYPEX)` on the IdentifierList.\r\n\r\nThis is a partial fix, since it will discard `CAST` from the alias setting, so that we don't double alias it. Yet it means that all `CAST` statements need to have an Alias.\r\n\r\nI think we should consider removing our forced `TOP` from MSSQL engines and maybe others that use `TOP`, too much complexity for the value it adds.\r\n\r\nPS: Following comments I'm reverting all logic behind squeezing aliases on functions for MSSQL. This implements a much simpler approach by catching MSSQL specific error for non aliased functions. This error is easy to catch since we are wrapping a TOP on the user's statement, otherwise we get an error from superset saying `no field of name`\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n<img width=\"831\"

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nAn emotion plugin `@emotion/babel-preset-css-prop` was added to the webpack config recently, which uses the `css` prop for emotion styling. This effectively makes `css` a \"reserved\" prop, which breaks dashboards that have custom css applied because they were using `css` as a plain old prop to pass the string around. So this change renames that prop to `customCss`\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to

function controlled csv upload schema\r\n\r\nRefactor + fix tests\r\n\r\n### CATEGORY\r\n\r\nChoose one\r\n\r\n- [x] Enhancement (new features, refinement)\r\n- [x] Refactor\r\n- [x] Add tests\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nThis PR implements a standard schema enforcements for the base and hive csv upload. In addition to that it introduces ALLOWED_USER_CSV_SCHEMA_FUNC and CSV_TO_HIVE_UPLOAD_DIRECTORY_FUNC config variables that can programmatically set a schema for the user during the file upload.\r\n\r\nAlso added csv_explore_db param to the db extras, to enable hive upload & presto explore. Not documenting it for now as will work soon on the similar functionality for the CTAS.\r\n\r\nIn addition to that there are 3 refactoring:\r\n1. simplified `create_table_from_csv` and pushed more logics & validation in to the `form_post` to bring more clarity to the function and not pass a generic form around\r\n2. refactored the tests to make them more reusable across the functions / test cases\r\n3. enabled multi insert for the database that support it and reduced the batch size to make it more performant. Prior to this there was separate insert command for 1 row.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n[x] Unit tests\r\n[x] Local testing\r\n[x] Dropbox staging\r\n[ ] Dropbox prod [being rolled out]\r\n\r\n###

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nWhen dashboard is landed in a hidden browser tab, charts are not fetched until user focus on the browser tab again. See this doc: https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/03/background_tabs\r\n\r\nWhen airbnb measure dashboard performance, we count page load time is from navigation start till all charts are loaded and rendered in the dashboard. When user open dashboard in a hidden tab, for example, ctrl+click a dashboard link, dashboard will be open in a new tab, but charts will not be loaded until user focus on this tab, and the whole hidden mode time is counted as dashboard load time.\r\n\r\nThis PR is to add a timing_event in dashboard perf logging data. It should log the total duration time that dashboard is in the hidden tab.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nManual test.\r\n\r\n\r\n### REVIEWERS\r\n@etr2460

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nWhen uploading a csv to Hive, all integer columns are created as INT, which causes integers greater than `2147483647` to appear `null`. This is not great if there are ids greater than a few billion.\r\n\r\nWe could probably be more specific and identify whether to use TINYINT, INT, BIGINT, DOUBLE, STRING, etc so that we don't top out at $2^63 - 1$, but that's for another time.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nTest on devbox.\r\n\r\n### REVIEWERS\r\n@john-bodley @etr2460

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nCharts with the metadata value `useLegacyApi` set to `false` will now query the new api endpoint.

Still verifying that charts work correctly in Dashboards. You're encouraged to try out the branch.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue

a DB.\r\n```sql\r\n-- Note: Unless you save your query, these tabs will NOT persist if you clear your cookies or change browsers.;\r\n\r\nSELECT * from flights;\r\n-- test. \r\n```\r\n\r\nThe issue is that parsesql is parsing the second comment as a separate statement. We check to see if the statement is a SELECT (it's a comment) and throw an error since the db is readonly. The fix is to stip comments before parsing the query into statements. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What

It appears that this is because we never merged a migration to move slices from the old type to the new one (see https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/4755#issuecomment-401981272).\r\n\r\nI've replicated/updated @jeffreythewang's work (thanks Jeffrey!) from

CATEGORY\r\n\r\nChoose one\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bug Fix\r\n- [x] Enhancement (new features, refinement)\r\n- [ ] Refactor\r\n- [ ] Add tests\r\n- [ ] Build / Development Environment\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nBeginning implementation of https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/issues/9194\r\n\r\nThis PR adds scaffolding for the client side part of custom error messages. No existing behavior should be changed yet. Scaffolding consists of:\r\n- introduce an `ErrorMessageComponentRegistry` for registering all error messages by error type\r\n- allow individual deployments to override these error messages with `setupErrorMessagesExtra`\r\n- display an error message from the registry if one exists for the given type, otherwise show the generic ErrorMessageWithStackTrace\r\n\r\nNote that this registry is included in the main Superset repo. This is because we only support translations in this repo currently, and it's important to allow all the error messages registered here to have translations.\r\n\r\nTodo in future PRs:\r\n- Add the new error object to client and backend responses\r\n- Introduce custom error message components\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nView a dashboard, ensure network errors and hardcoded raised errors still render properly\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nWhen I was researching on optimizing sql parser, I have tried using [`flatten`](https://sqlparse.readthedocs.io/en/latest/analyzing/#sqlparse.sql.TokenList.flatten) method to reduce processing time. However, `flatten` turns sql query into 1 dimensional iterator and it loses the ability to identify item as tokenList. TokenList is used as identifier to process as a table, see below https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/blob/e5c3e8964d8933069569809325200474157592c2/superset/sql_parse.py#L171-L175\r\n\r\nI have found that  `_extract_from_token` was recursively called on the same `item` for n times (n is length of `item.tokens`). It could be called only one time for `item`\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nCurrently form data validation errors are raised as `Exception` and aren't being caught in Flask views, causing uncaught application errors and false positives in error monitoring frameworks. This PR changes form validation exceptions in `viz.py` to `QueryObjectValidationError`-type exceptions (extends `SupersetException`), and catches them in the relevant Flask views. Application errors will not be caught in the views, ensuring that critical errors are still caught on error logs.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nLocal testing + CI\r\n\r\n### REVIEWERS\r\n@willbarrett

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nThe SPA menu component was relying on a hardcoded icon width of 126. This change exposes the config.py APP_ICON_WIDTH property to the frontend through the apps bootstrapping process and alters the SPA menu component to consume this value as the logo image width.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nn/a\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nSet APP_ICON_WIDTH property to a value other than 126 and observe the SPA and template version of the header have matching logo sizes.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [X] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Requires DB Migration.\r\n- [ ] Confirm DB Migration upgrade and downgrade

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a lightweight container (by way of a `dataclass`) to represent a SQL table. Previously we had been using a `str` to represent the table name (with optional schema and catalog) which lead to unnecessarily clunky code (especially in terms of the security manager).\r\n\r\nI also cleaned up some aspects of `sql_parse.ParsedQuery` renaming double underscore (`__`) \"private\" functions to single underscore (`_`). I also changed the security manager so `rejected_tables` returned a `set` rather than a `list`.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n###

CATEGORY\r\n\r\nChoose one\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bug Fix\r\n- [x] Enhancement (new features, refinement)\r\n- [ ] Refactor\r\n- [ ] Add tests\r\n- [ ] Build / Development Environment\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY \r\nHive organizes tables into partitions by dividing tables into different parts based on partition keys.\r\nWhen user query table with jinja template like \r\n\r\n> `WHERE ds=\"{{ presto.latest_partition(schema.my_table) }}\"`\r\n\r\nso that when data is partitioned by date, user can query data by the latest available date.\r\n\r\nSuperset offers jinja template to find the latest partition for a Presto engine:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/blob/a6cedaaa879348aca49a520793bb20e63d152a1f/superset/jinja_context.py#L247\r\nBut most of our users don't figure out how to use this syntax. And when table has multiple partitions, the syntax is pretty complicated.\r\n\r\nThis PR is to make easier to add latest_partition filter:\r\n\r\n1. When adhoc filter control is loaded, it will check API (/extra_table_metadata/_dbId_/_schema_/_table_/) to get extra table metadata. If current datasource support partitions, it will response like this:\r\n`{\r\n  \"partitions\": {\r\n    \"cols\": [\r\n      \"ds\",\r\n      \"hr\",\r\n      \"cluster\"\r\n    ],\r\n    \"latest\": {\r\n      \"ds\": \"2020-04-21\",\r\n      \"hr\": \"00\",\r\n      \"cluster\": \"presto-123\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"partitionQuery\": \"SELECT * FROM \\\"presto_audit.external_logs$partitions\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"view\": null\r\n}`\r\n\r\n1. When datasource has **single** partition, user will see `use latest partition template` as an operator in Simple tab.\r\n1. When user select a partition, adhoc filter will generate custom sql\r\n1. `use latest partition template` operator is only available for partition column.\r\n\r\n \r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n- **Before**: user needs manually add template in adhoc filter\r\n<img width=\"671\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-04-23 at 10 58 51 AM\"

CATEGORY\r\n\r\n- [x] Enhancement (new features, refinement)\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nIn order to enable [easy reordering of selected metrics/columns](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/issues/7129), we need to upgrade\r\n`react-select` v1 and v3.\r\n\r\nThis PR has done a lot of cleanups and refactoring to make this happen:\r\n\r\n1. Upgrade `react-select` from `1.3.0` to `3.1.0`.\r\n2. Replace `react-virtualized-select` with a custom implementation based on `react-window`. Inspired by but simpler than [react-windowed-select](https://github.com/jacobworrel/react-windowed-select): we did not handle grouped options, but added typing.\r\n3. Added **`src/components/Select`** and `SupersetStyledSelect` as the all-in-one entrypoint to all Superset styled selects. It also handles API backward compatibility for the purpose of: 1). increase usability; 2) keep changes in dependent modules minimal.\r\n4. Virtualized list (`WindowedSelect`) will be used only when options list is long ([currently > 100](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/blob/3106d17edf93ad1c781131b36cf0dd5d54719ac4/superset-frontend/src/components/Select/SupersetStyledSelect.tsx#L60)).\r\n5. Fix a couple of minor styling and UX bugs related ad-hoc metrics/filters.\r\n6. `src/components/StyledSelect` currently used in the new ListView will be deprecated.\r\n\r\nSince this is a fairly large change, it'd be highly appreciated if anyone who has worked on `react-select` or `SelectControl` component in Superset before could take a close look to these changes.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nI know I have made a promise to keep all original styles, but the UI did change a bit in the end, especially the multi-value labels. The new default UI from `react-select` do make some sense and I don't want to add more complexity to the code just for overriding them.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/335541/81346996-29c90c00-9070-11ea-895c-b210ef9865c3.png)\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/335541/81347092-4e24e880-9070-11ea-8c3f-daf5bd8d6633.png)\r\n\r\nAnother difference is that in FilterBox, selected filter values will not have bars indicate frequency. The original design doesn't make much sense anyway since each selected value is not of equal length and it kind of interferes with legibility.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n![Snip20200511_38](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/335541/81625710-8731c580-93ae-11ea-8491-b317449ae579.png)\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\n![Snip20200511_39](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/335541/81625718-8e58d380-93ae-11ea-94be-82cfb82d5479.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n###

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nThis API endpoint was issuing a couple of extra queries for each row. One for `ab_user` resolving created by field and another for fetching the correct datasource. Since druid support outside of SQLAlchemy is deprecated, making an outer join with SqlaTable.\r\n\r\nThe idea to optimize and avoid a query per row, is when using `@property` has a column and the method itself references a column, make sure this column is declared on `list_columns` so it's prefetched or SQLAlchemy will issue the extra query \r\n\r\nLocal times are:\r\nBefore:\r\n(timing) ChartRestApi.get_list.time = 130ms - 180ms\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n(timing) ChartRestApi.get_list.time = 25ms - 50ms\r\n\r\nDruid charts get displayed normally but if any, an extra query is issued for each one:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1149\" alt=\"Screenshot 2020-04-30 at 15 34 17\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4025227/80723100-18c04e00-8af8-11ea-9bba-81d211918394.png\">\r\n\r\n###
