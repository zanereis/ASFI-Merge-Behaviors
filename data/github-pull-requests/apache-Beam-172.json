[relocation](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/java/extensions/sql/build.gradle#L49), which is the change used for making zetasql jar work.\r\n\r\nThe problem is we haven't found a resolution for it by changing build.gradle. For example, we tried exclude relocation for `com.google.api.services`, which didn't help (any help on this idea will be appreciated). \r\n\r\nVendor Calcite could help because if we have vendor calcite, we can separate zetasql to another package with its own relocation. However by doing so we need wait for vendor calcite effort.\r\n\r\n@apilloud suggests we revert Beam ZetaSQL PR. I would more leaning to ignore this IT test for now.\r\n\r\n\r\nR: @kennknowles What do you think?

following changes. Didn't break these up into separate PRs since these are small changes but lemme know if I should.\r\n\r\n* Python SDK's current implementation requires one output to be identified as the main output. But external transforms do not identify a main output and I don't think this is required for execution of the transforms. So updated the code to pick one output tag of external transforms to be the main output tag.\r\n* Updates Python SDK to not to override the main output tag for external ParDo transforms. Java SDK in some cases requires the main output tag of ParDo transforms to not to change to operate correctly.\r\n* Updated TestPipeline to be able to provide additional pipeline options. This is is helpful when integration testing cross-language pipelines.\r\n* Fixed a bug when comparing environments in RunnerAPIPTransformHolder.to_runner_api() method.\r\n \r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Log Docker output both when the container fails to start up, and when it is closed normally.\r\n- In order to get logs for stopped (failed) containers, don't use the `rm` option for `docker run`, which deletes containers before we can inspect what happened to them. Instead, call `docker rm` ourselves to clean up the container only after we log its logs. (Behavior for `--retain_docker_container` stays the same.)\r\n- Remove a bit of dead code in Docker container startup.\r\n\r\nApologies for complicating the test setup -- I wanted to parameterize to make sure we're covering all the cases.\r\n\r\nR: @angoenka @mxm \r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

of unregistered types  in the Beam Go SDK are synthetically constructed with the reflect package. However, it's not possible to synthetically construct types with unexported fields with reflect.StructOf. This can be worked around by registering the given type, which avoids the expensive synthetic construction and this failure mode. \r\n\r\nThe failure manifests at pipeline execution time which is worse.\r\nThis PR moves that failure to pipeline construction time, where it presently manifests as a panic (until BEAM-8017 is resolved) with instructions how to register the type.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

the course of BEAM-6730 we added a way to Runner-translate Reads in portable\r\npipelines. GreedyPipelineFuser was manipulated to let through Reads to the\r\nRunner. The better solution for this problem would have been to remove the\r\nenvironment from unbounded reads, which will make it a Runner translated\r\ntransform.\r\n\r\nIf in the future we support unbounded reads via a SDF adapter, we can re-add the\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

up work of BEAM-7965.\r\n\r\nNote that this PR hasn't exposed retracting mode to users, in other words, users cannot specify retracting mode after this PR in Java SDK. \r\n\r\nTo really expose retracting mode for users, it will require a change at [Window.java](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/java/core/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/transforms/windowing/Window.java), which will happen much later.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

`ReadFromParquetBatched` and `ReadAllFromParquetBatched` to `apache_beam.io.parquetio`.\r\n\r\nThis moves the logic to split pyarrow.Table instances into python dictionaries out of `_ParquetSource` and into a new `_ArrowTableToRowDictionaries(DoFn)`. The original `ReadFromParquet` expands to `Read(source) | ParDo(_ArrowTableToRowDictionaries)` while `ReadFromParquetBatched` just reads directly from the source.\r\n\r\nBecause many of the tests operate on the source directly and not the actual IO transforms, they had to be modified to compare the output with the expected pyarrow Tables. This also created an issue with `apache_beam.testing.util.equal_to` - because `pyarrow.Table` instances don't sort deterministically, the faster comparison approach doesn't work correctly. This PR also modifies `equal_to` to verify inequality with the \"slower\" approach. My reasoning is that most test results will be a true positive, and just the faster approach can be used, so this shouldn't have a substantial effect on performance.\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-5164 for discussion.)\r\n\r\nParquetIO will fail when using Spark 2.2 and 2.3, since it relies on an API introduced in Parquet 1.10.0.\r\n\r\nSpark 2.4 is unaffected.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, we can't/shouldn't relocate the parquet packages for two reasons:\r\n\r\n(1) The Parquet CompressionCodec is exposed in the API, and\r\n(2) Parquet 1.10.0 depends on Avro 1.8.2 which would also require relocating.\r\n\r\nThe documented workaround is pretty simple and (in lieu of an actual fix) can unblock a user.\r\n\r\n**R:** @lgajowy Could you take a
