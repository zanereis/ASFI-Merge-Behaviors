Adding rowcount estimation for bigquery tables. This change creates a class to represent beam rowcount estimation. It has to pass the pipeline options in SQL transform path to BeamCalciteTable. Therefore, currently the pipeline options are passed to BeamCalciteTable in two different ways in SQLTransform path we get it as PipelineOption object. In JDBC path we get it as a Map<String, String> object.\r\nA Jira Issue is created to unify both paths so that they pass the PipelineOptions itself. https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/BEAM-7590\r\n\r\nR: @akedin \r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

the Python SDK lacks a clear API for data inter-op between a Python console and a Beam pipeline. During interactive development and debugging of Beam pipelines, this type of inter-op would be tremendously useful. \r\n\r\nOther \"big data\" processing tools in the Python ecosystem already have this functionality. For example, PySpark has [`createDataFrame`](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.sql.html#pyspark.sql.SparkSession.createDataFrame), which allows the creation of an RDD from a Python list or a Pandas DataFrame, and [`collect()`]() and [`toPandas()`](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.sql.html#pyspark.sql.DataFrame.toPandas) methods which make it possible to transfer the data to the Python interpreter. Dask has a similar API using [`dask.compute()`](https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/api.html#dask.compute).\r\n\r\nAlthough Beam has a `Create` `PTransform` which makes it possible to create a `PCollection` from a Python list. However, this has limited . Beam lacks a well-defined API for \"materializing\" a `PCollection` and loading it into the memory of an interactive Python session. \r\n\r\nThe following applications of `PCollectionCache` will be implemented in subsequent PRs:\r\n\r\n- Add a stream-based implementation (using Google Cloud Pub/Sub) of the `PCollectionCache` API [#8961].\r\n- Update `InteractiveRunner` and `CacheManager` to use `PCollectionCache` objects for storing cache data. This will add streaming pipeline support to `InteractiveRunner` and allow for more flexibility when optimizing the the interactive user experience.\r\n\r\nDemos: \r\n\r\n| Notebook | MyBinder | Colab |\r\n| ------------- | ------------- | -------- |\r\n| [01-demo_explicit_caching.ipynb](https://github.com/ostrokach/beam-notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/01-demo_explicit_caching.ipynb) | [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ostrokach/beam-notebooks/master?filepath=notebooks%2F01-demo_explicit_caching.ipynb) | [![Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ostrokach/beam-notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/01-demo_explicit_caching.ipynb)\r\n| [01-demo_pipeline_segmentation.ipynb](https://github.com/ostrokach/beam-notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/01-demo_pipeline_segmentation.ipynb) | [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ostrokach/beam-notebooks/master?filepath=notebooks%2F01-demo_pipeline_segmentation.ipynb) | [![Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ostrokach/beam-notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/01-demo_pipeline_segmentation.ipynb)\r\n| [01-demo_pipeline_cloning.ipynb](https://github.com/ostrokach/beam-notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/01-demo_pipeline_cloning.ipynb) | [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ostrokach/beam-notebooks/master?filepath=notebooks%2F01-demo_pipeline_cloning.ipynb) | [![Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ostrokach/beam-notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/01-demo_pipeline_cloning.ipynb)\r\n\r\nCC: @ivant @ananvay  \r\nR: @aaltay @udim \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Beam IOs support typed reads with user-supplied parse functions (for example,

it seems reasonable to make Pubsub's public also. We have a lot of use cases where we read in `PubsubMessage` then immediately apply a map from `PubsubMessage => T` and this would save us a step.\r\n\r\ncc @nevillelyh @kanterov \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

wish to be able to write BYTES type fields to BigQuery.\r\n\r\nIn BigQueryUtils (sdks/io/google-cloud-platform) when serialising a BYTES type BEAM field for BQ there is a faulty cast to java.nio.ByteBuffer while the value will always be a primitive byte array (see org.apache.beam.sdk.values.Row.Builder#verifyPrimitiveType).\r\n\r\nTrying to use BigQueryUtils when writing a BYTES field to BiqQuery will cause\r\n`\r\njava.lang.ClassCastException: [B cannot be cast to java.nio.ByteBuffer at org.apache.beam.sdk.io.gcp.bigquery.BigQueryUtils.fromBeamField(BigQueryUtils.java:280)\r\n`\r\nand the added tests in BigQueryUtilsTest will trigger this, and the changes to BigQueryUtils intends to solve it.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Use `dis.get_instructions` in Python 3. This serves as a convenience (handling EXTENDED_ARG for instance), and is an extra sanity check for `pc` values.\r\n\r\n- Added and expanded opcodes:\r\nmap_add, build_map, load_method, load_closure, make_function, call_function (call_function_{kw,ex} not supported)\r\n\r\n- `Union`s now combine `Dict`s: \r\n`Union[Dict[k1,v1], Dict[k2, v2], ... ]`\r\nbecomes: \r\n`Union[Dict[Union[k1, k2, ...], Union[v1, v2, ...]]]`\r\n\r\n- Empty Unions (`Union[]`) are placeholders for lack of type information. At the end of inference they are finalized (if remaining) to `Any`.\r\nFor example: at the end of inference a `Dict[Union[], Union[]]` (no type information for key and value) will be finalized into `Dict[Any, Any]`.\r\n\r\n- Enabled debug printouts in tests. This should only appear in test logs in case of an error.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

a decent amount of debugging of the checkpoint/restore/rescale code, I\r\nmanaged to find the culprit. The issue here is the lazy state creation that Beam\r\nuses by default. State is created in Flink's state backend upon first \"binding\"\r\nof the state. Binding is only performed when processElement is called. Now, it\r\ncan happen that an operator does not receive elements before checkpointed. In\r\nthis case the state won't be initialized.\r\n\r\nDepending on the maxParallelism, this can lead to the state being partitioned\r\nsuch that an operator attempts to restore from a keygroup that did not have the\r\nstate in its meta data. However, the actual data ends up containing the state\r\nwhich looks like a bug in the Flink key group partitioner.\r\n\r\nThe workaround is to ensure that all user state is registered before\r\ncheckpointing is first attempted. This resolves all issues with rescaling Beam\r\njobs.\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

change implements splitAtFraction for BigQueryStorageStreamReader, which allows Google Cloud Dataflow to perform dynamic worker rebalancing when reading data from BigQuery.\r\n\r\nStill TODO:\r\n\r\n- Implement progress reporting. I need to implement this on the server-side first, which I will start doing this week. As-is, all splits are optimistically performed at 0.5.\r\n\r\n- Update the Google API libraries. Currently, I'm setting unknown fields in several protocol buffer. I've added TODOs everywhere that this is done, and will update them to use the real setters once the client libraries are updated.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR is a small, discrete chunk of the Sort-Merge Bucket algorithm implementation ([design doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AQlonN8t4YJrARcWzepyP7mWHTxHAd6WIECwk1s3LQQ/edit?usp=sharing)), extracted into a smaller PR for easier reviewing as suggested [in the JIRA ticket](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-6766). It contains read/write logic for Avro, Tensorflow, and JSON records at a per-record granularity. These are needed because once the PCollection is bucketed and sorted, we can't re-use existing sources/sinks and risk a reshuffling of the data, so we have to manage file reads and writes very explicitly.\r\n\r\nCC @kennknowles @nevillelyh @reuvenlax @kanterov \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR is a small, discrete chunk of the Sort-Merge Bucket algorithm implementation ([design doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AQlonN8t4YJrARcWzepyP7mWHTxHAd6WIECwk1s3LQQ/edit?usp=sharing)), extracted into a smaller PR for easier reviewing as suggested [in the JIRA ticket](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-6766). It contains a JSON-serializable `BucketMetadata` abstract class and specific implementations for JSON, Avro, and TensorFlow (`org.tensorflow.example.Example`) collections. The intention here is that during an SMB write, a `metadata.json` file will be written alongside the bucketed record files, and read again at join time to ensure compatibility, reconstruct key coders, etc.\r\n\r\nCC @kennknowles @nevillelyh @reuvenlax @kanterov \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
