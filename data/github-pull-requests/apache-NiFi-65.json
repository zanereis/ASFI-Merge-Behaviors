in UpdateRecord before obtaining Writer Schema. This allows the Writer to  to inherit the Schema of the updated Record instead of the Schema of the Record as it was when it was read.\r\n - Updated JoltTransformRecord so that schema is inferred on the first transformed object before passing the schema to the Record Writer, so that if writer inherits schema from record, the schema that is inherited is the trans transformed schema\r\n - Updated LookupRecord to allow for Record fields to be arbitrarily added\r\n - Implemented ContentClaimInputStream\r\n - Added controller service for caching schemas\r\n - UpdatedQueryRecord to cache schemas automatically up to some number of schemas, which will significantly inprove throughput in many cases, especially with inferred schemas.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

'or' and 'and' functions can be called multiple times within the same context using the same evaluator instance.\r\nThat happens if their subject is derived from an IteratingEvaluator such as 'anyDelineatedValues'.\r\n\r\nAnd if the right hand side expression for such 'or' and 'and' contains another IteratingEvaluator,\r\nthen it can be evaluated more than the number of its candidates, ultimately an ArrayOutOfBoundsException is thrown.\r\n\r\nThis commit makes Or/AndEvaluator caching its right hand side result to prevent that happens.\r\nFor 'or' and 'and' functions, the right hand side expression is independant from their subject boolean value.\r\nIt's enough evaluating right hand side once, because it returns the same result even with different subjects.\r\n\r\nThank you for
