ingestion into smaller topics. Clean up some style here and there.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis PR breaks down the ingestion landing page topic into smaller topics. Some benefits include:\r\n- Ingestion concepts like the Data Model, Rollup, and Partitioning now have smaller more focused topics.\r\n- The Ingestion spec reference stands alone as a reference topic.\r\n- Should make it easier to add conceptual or example material for a specific concept.\r\n\r\nThere may be some trade off in topic maintenance. For example if there's an enhancement to rollup, we may need to edit `rollup.md` and `ingestion-spec.md`.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid

Description\r\n\r\nUpdate the default maxSegmentsInNodeLoadingQueue from 0 (unbounded) to 100.\r\n\r\nAn unbounded maxSegmentsInNodeLoadingQueue can cause cluster instability.\r\nSince this is the default druid operators need to run into this instability\r\nand then look through the docs to see that the recommended value for a large\r\ncluster is 1000. This change makes it so the default will prevent clusters\r\nfrom falling over as they grow over time.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added

hostname validation not skipping with `druid.client.https.validateHostnames=false` in java 8u275 and later\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nHostname validation is not skipped even after setting `druid.client.https.validateHostnames=false` in java 8u275 and later. This is due to code change introduced in Java 8u275. To disable validate hostnames, Druid sets the endpointIdentificationAlgorithm of the SSLParameters in the SSLEngine to null (using the SSLEngine#setSSLParameters method). This is done in CustomCheckX509TrustManager#checkServerTrusted. In 8u242, the SSLEngine#setSSLParameters (https://github.com/openjdk/jdk8u/blob/b996dbe72ce338fdc430fbba1bb995ce622109e3/jdk/src/share/classes/sun/security/ssl/SSLEngineImpl.java#L2102 ) simply get the new endpointIdentificationAlgorithm from the given input SSLParameters (params) and set it without any verification of the new endpointIdentificationAlgorithm value. In 8u275,  the SSLEngine#setSSLParameters (https://github.com/openjdk/jdk8u/blob/37d4863386fb7fccb846f46b1bc85b4c61fe1c88/jdk/src/share/classes/sun/security/ssl/SSLEngineImpl.java#L763 ) calls TransportContext#SSLConfiguration#setSSLParameters (https://github.com/openjdk/jdk8u/blob/37d4863386fb7fccb846f46b1bc85b4c61fe1c88/jdk/src/share/classes/sun/security/ssl/SSLConfiguration.java#L199 ). This method will not set endpointIdentificationAlgorithm to the new value if the new value is null (https://github.com/openjdk/jdk8u/blob/37d4863386fb7fccb846f46b1bc85b4c61fe1c88/jdk/src/share/classes/sun/security/ssl/SSLConfiguration.java#L231 ). Hence, the endpointIdentificationAlgorithm would remains as HTTPS and trigger validate hostnames in X509TrustManagerImpl. The code that determines to validate hostname or not in X509TrustManagerImpl is actually the pre and post 8u275, which is to validate hostname if the identityAlg != null && identityAlg.length() != 0 (note that identityAlg variable is the EndpointIdentificationAlgorithm of the SSLParameters).\r\n\r\nAs a workaround, we can set EndpointIdentificationAlgorithm to an empty String instead. This will still cause the hostname validation to be skipped.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

testing have shown a potential performance degradation in the bounded memory work for segment creation of batch ingestion.  The reason is most probably the fact that intermediate persists are blocking, serial, with ingestion. We will add back concurrent persists and test performance to validate that previous performance is back.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\nIntermediate persists are made concurrent with adding rows in the batch appenderator. \r\n\r\nWe are also interested in supporting three main modes for the batch appenderator, this PR is implementing also the following requirements:\r\n\r\n-  Fix the performance regression by making persists & push concurrent \r\n- Have a rollback flag called batchProcessingMode. This configuration setting will be able to take three string values: LEGACY, CLOSED_SEGMENTS, CLOSED_SEGMENTS_SINKS (see table below). The default value will be: CLOSED_SEGMENTS. Note that most existing tests will exercise the default but there are specific tests for the other two modes (see configuration docs to know what each of these mean).\r\n- Update docs to document the new processing mode\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [ X] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [x] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\nThis PR adds a config for the `CustomTierSelectorStrategy` which can\r\nbe used to specify a list of allowed Historical Tiers that the Broker can\r\nconnect to.\r\n\r\nThis can be used

query error logging\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen adding and developing new query functionality (such as adding a new Aggregator), it may be hard to debug due to limited logging information. This PR change the log level of logging query exception (in QueryLifecycle) from WARN to ERROR to make the Exception easier to find and identify. This PR also adds a query context `enableQueryDebugging ` that can make the above error logging (in QueryLifecycle) to include the stack trace of the Exception. The new context, `enableQueryDebugging`, would not only add the Exception stracktrace but can include other current and feature functionality that would help user debug when query doesnât work. It would include things like additional metrics and logs (not part of this PR but will create followup PRs). This one config would let us avoid add many many other configs keys by rolling up all related query debugging functionalities into one easy to remember and use queryContext.\r\n \r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nThe topN engine can have an optimization that avoids computing unnecessary keys that cannot be included in the final result. When `useApproximateTopN` is unset, this optimization can be used when these 2 conditions are met.\r\n\r\n- The query should not have filters.\r\n- The interval of storageAdapter should match to that of the query.\r\n\r\n[This `if` clause](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/processing/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/query/topn/BaseTopNAlgorithm.java#L317-L321) checks whether this optimization is possible, but currently has a bug that it does not check whether the storageAdapter has built-in filters. For example, when the storageAdapter is a `HashJoinSegmentStorageAdapter`, its cursor may return a less number of unique values because of the join condition. Because this check is currently missing, the topN on an inner join can use the optimized path which effectively applies the limit before computing join, which in turn causing incorrect query result. This PR adds a new method, `hasBuiltInFilters`, in `StorageAdapter` to fix this bug.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `StorageAdapter`\r\n * `HashJoinSegmentStorageAdapter`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

shutdown. After that a new task is pulled up to start over from the previous checkpointed offset which is done like one hour ago.\r\n\r\nI think it is better to retry this `pause` to wait for the publishing finished and finally the offset checkpoint can success, rather than a force shutdown\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `SeekableStreamIndexTaskRunner`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

#11437 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nIn order to support setups where SSL termination happens at the ELB and the communication from ELB to druid is on plain HTTP protocol, we would need some way to represent proper call back url which is based on HTTPS protocol.\r\n\r\nCurrently NoParameterCallbackUrlResolver picks up the current webserver configuration, which in this case happens to be http, but the actual communication goes out from an https connection and okta ends up barfing out with the following error.,\r\n\r\nError code - 400 bad request (Invalid request)\r\nError message -Â The 'redirect_uri' parameter must be a Login redirect URI in the client app settings: https://something-admin.okta.com/admin/app/oidc_client/instance/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx#tab-general\r\n\r\nIf there was configuration that allows users to manually specify a custom callback url, then we can easily override the current jetty webserver config on druid and proxy the ELB's url. \r\n\r\nThis is similar to what knox provides in some sense using the following parameter\r\n\"knoxJwtRealm.redirectParam = originalUrl\"\r\n\r\nTested the changes locally using dev.okta account.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-27T16:42:50Z","updated_at":"2023-11-09T00:16:47Z","closed_at":"2023-11-09T00:16:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"68af4b4ada5c9886d50aec562d5de612936de2e2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"himanshug","id":246308,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjMwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/246308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug","html_url":"https://github.com/himanshug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":698268891,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTgyNjg4OTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Extension","name":"Area

PR adds a new `markAsUnused` option for the Kill Task, which allows it to mark any segments within the specified interval as unused before deleting the unused segments within an interval.\r\n\r\nThis is useful for allowing the mark unused -> delete sequence to happen with a single API call for the caller, as well as allowing the unmark action to occur under a task interval lock.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid

Description\r\nThis change allows the selection of a specific broker service (or broker tier) by the Router.\r\n\r\nThe newly added `ManualTieredBrokerSelectorStrategy` works as follows:\r\n- Check for the parameter `brokerService` in the query context. If this is a valid broker service, use it.\r\n- Check if the field `defaultManualBrokerService` has been set in the strategy. If this is a valid broker service, use it.\r\n- Move on to the next strategy\r\n\r\n### Changes in this PR\r\n * Add class `ManualTieredBrokerSelectorStrategy`\r\n * Add parameter `brokerService` in `QueryContexts`\r\n * Update docs\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

PR fixes an issue with the integration test `copy_resources.sh` script. \r\n\r\nThe \"install druid jars\" portion was removing the `$SHARED_DIR/docker` directory, which wipes out the `$SHARED_DIR/docker/extensions` and `$SHARED_DIR/docker/credentials` directories created just before, which leads to issues later in the script when copying resources to the `$SHARED_DIR/docker/credentials/` dir.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x] added integration tests.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test Druid

parallel task currently reports the null error message in taskStatus in most cases. The users are required to look up the parallel task logs to see why the task failed.\r\n\r\nThe parallel task can fail because of these reasons:\r\n\r\n- Subtask failures. This is most common.\r\n\r\n- The task is canceled.\r\n\r\n- Bugs in the system, such as OOM.\r\n\r\nThis issue addresses the first 2 cases. For the subtask failures, the parallel task should report the last ingestion status in the error message in taskStatus, such as the phase where the ingestion failed, number of tasks succeeded/failed/running/total, and retry subtaskIds of the failed subtaskSpec. More details about the subtask failure will be in both the subtask report and the parallel task report. For canceled tasks, the error message should say something like \"This task is canceled\".\r\n\r\nIn general, the error message should meet these criteria.\r\n\r\nError should not show the node details.\r\n\r\nError should be understandable to basic users. For internal errors, it should lead users to reading task logs and task reports instead of putting too much information in taskStatus because the errorMsg field in taskStatus is truncated.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

per discussion in #10920, breaking the changes down into smaller PRs. See that PR and the linked proposal for more high-level detail on this initiative.)\r\n\r\nInitial module set up (e.g. pom, checkstyle, exclusions, licenses, etc.), support classes (mix-ins traits for logging and the try-with-resources pattern & configuration helpers), and an HTTP client for talking to a Druid cluster.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis PR handles the initial setup for the spark module and adds a few core utility classes.\r\n\r\n1. Creates the module and adds it to Druid's base pom.xml\r\n2. Adds a scalastyle configuration mirroring the checkstyle settings for Java\r\n3. Updates the pre-push hook and travis checkstyle test to include a scalastyle check for the spark module\r\n4. Updates LICENSE and NOTICE to reflect new dependencies\r\n5. Adds two Scala mix-in traits, `Logging` and `TryWithResources` that provide generic logging and ARM patterns\r\n6. Adds a Configuration class that wraps a Properties instance and provides utility functions around it\r\n7. Adds a DruidConfigurationKeysClass to centralize config keys\r\n8. Adds an HTTP DruidClient that handles sending requests to a Druid broker.\r\n\r\nThe reason we pass a Configuration class around instead of using dependency injection is because we will need to access some properties on the driver, some on the executors, and some on both types of nodes and so we would need to instantiate dependency injection on every node. An alternative would be to use serializable Providers to ship dependency information to the executors, but even with this messy approach it is non-trivial in Spark 2.4 to ensure that code executes exactly once on every executor before beginning processing. Additionally, we would encounter dependency version clashes because Spark and Druid use different versions of Guice, and we would force users to resolve these conflicts as well even if we shaded our version of Guice because we would need to expose APIs against the shaded Guice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `Configuration`\r\n * `DruidClient`\r\n * `DruidConfigurationKeys`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

integration tests for S3 Assume Role ingestion feature\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds integration tests for S3 Assume Role ingestion feature introduced in https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/10995/files\r\n\r\nThe new integration tests are not run as part of Travis since it requires S3 credentials of an active AWS account. While the new integration tests are added to existing test group, they will be skip if the required properties for S3 Role are not provided (`-Ddruid.test.config.s3AssumeRoleWithExternalId`, `-Ddruid.test.config.s3AssumeRoleExternalId`, `-Ddruid.test.config.s3AssumeRoleWithoutExternalId`). This is done in order to keep existing test groups passing without the immediate needs to provide the new properties. \r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x] added integration tests.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-21T07:00:36Z","updated_at":"2021-09-14T03:18:31Z","closed_at":"2021-07-23T03:09:10Z","merged_at":"2021-07-23T03:09:09Z","merge_commit_sha":"161f4dbc0ef5d429d8f16b43e0baf8efbacf5d13","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":303259531,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMDMyNTk1MzE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Testing","name":"Area

PR implements functions that extract a value from a JSON-encoded string.\r\n\r\n### New functions\r\n\r\n| function | description |\r\n| --- | --- |\r\n| json_extract_string(expr,string...) | Extracts the String value from expr based on string arguments. |\r\n| json_extract_long(expr,string...) | Extracts the Long value from expr based on string arguments. |\r\n| json_extract_double(expr,string...) | Extracts the Double value from expr based on string arguments. |\r\n| jsonpath_extract_string(expr,json-path) | Extracts the String value from expr based on json-path. |\r\n| jsonpath_extract_long(expr,json-path) | Extracts the Long value from expr based on json-path. |\r\n| jsonpath_extract_double(expr,json-path) | Extracts the Double value from expr based on json-path. |\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\n\r\nThe `json_extract_*` family of functions extract a value from a JSON-encoded string.\r\n\r\n```SQL\r\nSELECT json_extract_string('{\"key1\":\"val1\"}', 'key1')\r\n-- Extract a value from a nested object\r\nSELECT json_extract_string('{\"key1\":{\"key2\":\"val2\"}}', 'key1', 'key2')\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `jsonpath_extract_*` family of functions support JSONPath expressions referring to a JSON structure in the same way as XPath expression.\r\n\r\n```SQL\r\nSELECT jsonpath_extract_string('{\"key\":[{\"k\":\"v1\"},{\"k\":\"v2\"}]}', '$.key[0].k')\r\n```\r\n\r\n### FastJsonReader\r\nThe `json_extract_*` family of functions use FastJsonReader.\r\n\r\nIn order to improve extraction performance, I implemented light and fast parser called FastJsonReader.\r\n\r\nIn my environment, it is faster than Jsonpath in the case of extracting a scalar value. However, Jsonpath offers lots of functionalities.\r\n\r\n### Benchmark\r\nI did benchmark test with the query below.\r\n\r\n```SQL\r\nselect v, count(*) \r\nfrom (\r\n    select json_extract_string(json_column, 'key') as v \r\n    from test\r\n) \r\ngroup by v\r\norder by count(*) desc\r\n```\r\n\r\n####  Benchmark 1 - Single Node, Small dataset\r\n1 node / 6 core, 32G RAM,

PR splits current `SegmentLoader` into `SegmentLoader` and `SegmentCacheManager`. \r\n- `SegmentLoader` - this class is responsible for building the segment object but does not expose any methods for downloading, cache space management, etc. Default implementation delegates the download operations to `SegmentCacheManager` and only contains the logic for building segments once downloaded.  . This class will be used in `SegmentManager` to construct `Segment` objects. \r\n\r\n- `SegmentCacheManager` - this class manages the segment cache on the local disk. It fetches the segment files to the local disk, can clean up the cache, and in the future, support `reserve` and `release` on cache space. [See https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/11398]. This class will be used in ingestion tasks such as compaction, re-indexing where segment files need to be downloaded locally.  \r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `SegmentLoader`\r\n * `SegmentCacheManager`\r\n * `SegmentLoadDropHandler`\r\n * `SegmentLocalCacheManager`\r\n * `SegmentLocalCacheLoader`\r\n *  `SegmentLoaderFactory` > `SegmentCacheManagerFactory`\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\n\r\nThe architecture document is a wonderful overview of the Druid system. Often a newbie can spot opportunities for improvement in documentation focused on newbies. As someone familiar with distributed systems, but a newbie to Druid, I noticed a few odd phrases, some inconsistent formats, and places where a few things could be stated a bit more clearly. This is a roll-up of those edits.\r\n\r\nClearly, a Druid expert should scan the changes to ensure that the material remains accurate.\r\n\r\nThis doc-only PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n-

Description\r\n\r\nThe \"build from source\" and \"build website\" pages are very useful but miss a few details needed by newbies. This PR adds those details from the perspective of someone familiar with Apache projects in general, but not Druid in particular.\r\n\r\nThe top-level `README.md` provides a good overview of features, but we often want to know what Druid *is* before we dive into the UI and how to run it. So, added a link to the excellent architecture page.\r\n\r\nAdded more hints to the website `README.md`, including how to run a spellcheck.\r\n\r\nCleaned up a few spacing and capitalization style issues to use the most prevalent style.\r\n\r\nThis doc-only PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] been reviewed using the Markdown viewer of VS Code (`README.md` files)\r\n- [x] been reviewed

The revisions from the perspective of someone a) familiar with big data tools, but not Druid specifically, and b) familiar with Docker, but not docker-compose specifically. Added links, explanations and other details to the Docker tutorial to make it easier for first-time users. \r\n\r\nClarified the configuration and actions needed for the Quickstart vs. those to take when using the same Docker scripts in production.\r\n\r\nThis PR\r\n- [x]  has been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x]  is a doc-only PR.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #11461\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

Description\r\n\r\nA concurrency issue is recently found between `DruidSchema` and `BrokerServerView`, which is, refreshing a `DruidTable` in `DruidSchema` can block query processing. This can happen in the scenario described below.\r\n\r\n1. The `DruidSchema-Cache` thread locks `DruidSchema#lock` and calls `DruidSchema.buildDruidTable()` to rebuild the rowSignature of druidTable.\r\n2. A new segment is added to `BrokerServerView`. The `BrokerServerView` thread will lock `BrokerServerView#lock`, process the new segment added, and call timelineCallbacks of `DruidSchema`.\r\n3. The timeline callback of `DruidSchema` is executed by the same thread used in the step 2. This thread will wait for `DruidSchema.buildDruidTable()` in the step 1 to be done and `DruidSchema#lock` is released.\r\n4. A new query is issued and the query thread will call `BrokerServerView.getTimeline()`. This call will wait for the timelineCallbacks to be done in the step 2 and `BrokerServerView#lock` is released.\r\n\r\nThe following flame graphs show what those threads were doing when this happened in our cluster. The metrics for these flame graphs were collected for 30 seconds.\r\n\r\n![DruidSchema](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2322288/125991564-008eddf1-1bc8-435b-bc93-4b331589c0a8.png)\r\n\r\n`DruidSchema` was calling `refreshSegmentsForDataSource()` and `buildDruidTable()`. `refreshSegmentsForDataSource` issues a `SegmentMetadataQuery` per segment and locks `DruidSchema#lock` per row in the result to update segment metadata in memory. `buildDruidTable` locks `DruidSchema#lock` _while it iterates all columns in all segments_ in the datasource. When the datasource has 481200 segments and 774 columns in each segment, `buildDruidTable` took about 25 seconds (!!) on my desktop.\r\n\r\n![BrokerServerView](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2322288/125991550-eb61f746-56f2-4ca0-9494-d3ad20a929e4.png)\r\n\r\n`BrokerServerView` was blocked in the `DruidSchema.addSegment` callback.\r\n\r\n![2 timeseries queries](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2322288/125991541-e3b7972e-397f-4e9c-a012-66a2d7b32285.png)\r\n\r\nFinally, there were 2 timeseries queries that were blocked in `BrokerServerView.getTimeline()` for 30 seconds.\r\n\r\nCurrently, this can happen whenever `DruidSchema` needs to refresh `DruidTable`, which is whenever a new segment is added to the cluster or a segment is completely removed from the cluster. Moving segments should not cause this issue because a new segment is always loaded first in the new server before it is removed from the previous server. As a result, moving segments does not require to update the `RowSignature` of `DruidTable`.\r\n\r\nTo fix this issue, this PR improves the concurrency of `DruidSchema` by not holding `DruidSchema#lock` to process expensive operations such as refreshing `DruidTables`.\r\n\r\n- A new thread, `DruidSchema-Callback`, is added in `DruidSchema` to asynchronously process the timeline callbacks.\r\n- The `segmentMetadataInfo` map is changed to `ConcurrentHashMap<String, ConcurrentSkipListMap<SegmentId, AvailableSegmentMetadata>>`, so that updating the map doesn't have to lock `DruidSchema#lock`. Instead, the concurrency control is delegated to `ConcurrentMap`s. This could potentially make querying the segments table faster because `getSegmentMetadataSnapshot()` no longer requires to lock `DruidSchema#lock`.\r\n\r\nFinally, this PR does not fix the expensive logic in `buildDruidTable()`. Incremental updates on `DruidTable` could be better but it requires that, for each column, we should be able to fall back to the column type in the second most recent segment when the most recent segment disappears. We can research more how we can track those column types of segments efficiently as a follow-up.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `DruidSchema`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [x] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR is a follow-up of https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/11419 and fills the error message in `TaskStatus` properly when the task fails in the middleManager, indexer, or peon. It includes a minor refactoring for `ForkingTaskRunner` to make it more testable. Other than that, all changes are quite straight forward.\r\n\r\nWhile I was making this PR, I remembered an issue with `TaskRunnerListener` that sometimes a wrong taskStatus is fed even though `TaskRunnerListener` is almost not in use. I created https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/11445 to track this issue.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Auto scaler pendingTaskBased provisioning strategy to handle when there are no currently running worker node better\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAs described in https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/10918, the PendingTaskBasedWorkerProvisioningStrategy of the Auto scaler does not work well when there are 0 worker node running. The problems are the following:\r\n1. When there are 0 worker node running, currently the auto scaler will first scale up to minWorkerCount and only in the next provisioning cycle would be able to determine the correct number of workers needed to run all pending tasks. This is inefficient as we will have to go through two provisioning cycle plus the time it takes for the worker nodes in the first provisioning to be up and running before being able to scale to the correct number (basically it would take twice as long as needed)\r\n2. When the minWorkerCount is set to 0 and there are 0 worker node running, the autoscaler will never attempts to add more instances. This is because the auto scaler will try to scale to minWorkerCount (which is 0). Hence, pending task will not be able to run. \r\n\r\nThe reason for the auto scaler scaling to minWorkerCount first is because without any running worker node, the auto scaler will not be able to determine the capacity per worker. (note even when there are running worker nodes, that the auto scaler assume that all worker nodes have the same capacity and use the capacity of the first running node). \r\n\r\nTo fix this problem, I introduce a new config in the PendingTaskBasedWorkerProvisioningConfig under `druid.indexer.autoscale.workerCapacityFallback`. This config tells the auto scaler the worker capcity for determining number of workers needed when there are currently no worker running. If unset or null, auto scaler will scale to `minNumWorkers` in autoScaler config instead. Note: this config is only applicable to `pendingTaskBased` provisioning strategy. Even if this config value is not accurate (i.e. if your worker node capacity changed over time) it is still useful for solving problem # 2 above, as the auto scaler will at least provision some nodes and in the next providing cycle will be able to determine the correct number of workers needed (rather than being stuck at 0 workers forever). \r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Converting such left joins into inner joins (since logically the mentioned left join query is equivalent to an inner join) using Calcite while maintaining that the druid execution layer can execute such inner joins.\r\n2. Preferring converted inner joins over original left joins in our cost model\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes unnecessary checks\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

This PR allows a context map to be defined in runtime.properties using the config `druid.broker.internal.query.config.context`. For instance, you could set a query priority by giving that config this value: `{ \"context\": {\"priority\": 5}}`\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\nThis way requires coder to know that they need to procure and pass in this context config to internally generated queries. I thought it would be cool if there was some way to rig everything up to have internal queries not require the coder to remember/know this, but couldn't think of a way.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #11421.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

API retains status for datasources that no longer existed causing in-memory used to grow unbounded\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThe compaction/status API retains stats of datasources that were previously compacted in memory. The purpose of this is to be able to maintain and report compaction status of datasource (how much of it was compacted, how much left to compacted, etc.) even after compaction was disabled (compaction config was deleted). The bug here is that the compaction/status API retains stats of datasources that was deleted too. This can causes the in-bound memory used to grow unbound. \r\n\r\nThis change removes any datasource that does not have an enabled auto compaction config from the compaction/status API. This means that the compaction/status API will now only return datasource that has auto compaction config enabled in the latest auto compaction run only. The reason for removing stats for datasource that is active but has auto compaction disabled is that the latest stats will no longer be accurate and instead can be misleading as that datasource's shape changes (more data ingested, new intervals, etc.)\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nIngestion tasks can fail in the overlord for various reasons. Currently, these tasks are marked as failed but their taskStatus doesn't report the error message properly in most cases. These can be categorized into 3 cases as below.\r\n\r\n- Canceled by users. This case is not really task failures, but those tasks are marked as failed.\r\n- Internal errors. Any sort of internal errors such as unknown tasks or task assignment timeout are included in this case.\r\n- Sanity checks. This case is similar to internal errors, but the difference is that the cases tested by these sanity checks should never happen in any case.\r\n\r\nBecause these tasks fail in the overlord, neither the task logs nor task reports are available, and thus it's quite hard for users to debug when this happens unless you have knowledge of the ingestion system internals. This PR addresses this concern by adding user-friendly error messages in taskStatus. Since the error message field is truncated, it should contain a simple message that leads users to reading logs for further investigation. The 3 cases above should change as below after this PR.\r\n\r\n- Canceled tasks should report in taskStatus that they are canceled.\r\n- Internal errors should report a simple user-friendly error message in taskStatus.\r\n- Sanity checks should also report a simple user-friendly error message in taskStatus.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

a comprehensive review of the data loading flow in the web console and in the process found some small issues that are fixed here, 1 commit = 1 issue fixed.\r\n\r\nThe issues are:\r\n\r\n- Quotes typo in description text\r\n- The SQL doc structure changed (there was a column added) and the doc parsing was too lose - tightened up\r\n- Make array input (used for column input in CSV parser) not lose your curser while typing \r\n- Make it possible to click-to-filter the group_id column in the tasks table\r\n- Exact table search in the Segments table was unnecessarily lowercasing the search string\r\n- Don't resort the columns alphabetically, trust the JSON instead - maintain column order (especially helpful for formats like CSV and TSV)\r\n- Allow bypassing the transform step, if you go to filter directly and then click `Next` it should populate the schema at that point if it has not already been done.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-06T22:58:39Z","updated_at":"2021-08-12T09:27:07Z","closed_at":"2021-07-10T14:56:51Z","merged_at":"2021-07-10T14:56:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"377b5e708c926fea3b53e6f22cc1e12262fb62e0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1251906357,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjUxOTA2MzU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Web%20Console","name":"Area
