PR aims to automate the creation of Config docs and add pre-commit hooks that would also serve as tests.\r\n\r\n**Preview**:\r\n- **Layout 1**: https://near-cherry.surge.sh/configurations-ref.html\r\n- **Layout 2**: https://flowery-ray.surge.sh/configurations-ref.html (Similar to our CLI doc)\r\n\r\nAlso, add a structure to the documentation by adding the following sections:\r\n\r\n- Description\r\n- Example\r\n- Type\r\n- Default\r\n- Version the config was added in (for new configs) (Example: [link](https://flowery-ray.surge.sh/configurations-ref.html#store-serialized-dags))\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8811558/71726881-5c4bc980-2e30-11ea-8df0-793cf6b00f8c.png)\r\n\r\nfor each config\r\n\r\n\r\nA user would only need to modify at a single place: **config.yml**, changes in `default_airflow.cfg` would be auto-generated using the pre-commit hook.\r\n\r\n---\r\nLink to

were occuring in mysql when task_instance was modified\r\nby two queries at the same time. One query used state as selection\r\ncriteria and updated it in the same query where second query just\r\nupdated the state for the same table. The first query locked state\r\nindex first and primary index afterwards, the second query locked\r\nprimary index first and state afterwards - leading to deadlocks.\r\n\r\nThis change splits the first query into two independent ones.\r\nFirst query makes select FOR UPDATE and selects all the task\r\ninstances to act on (this will lock primary index only)\r\nand second updates all affected task instances.\r\n\r\nNote that performance impact for that is neglectable because this\r\nquery is only run once every scheduler loop and the second part\r\nof it (looping through task instances) will only happen in case\r\nthere are some manually modified DagRun states - so it is only\r\nrun to correct some wrong states of DagRun.

WIP status\r\n\r\n- this is a first sketch that requires a lot more work to evaluate\r\n- this is motivated by [AIP-28](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/AIP-28%3A+Add+AsyncExecutor+option)\r\n- see https://gist.github.com/seglberg/0b4487b57b4fd425c56ad72aba9971be\r\n  - consider the subclass `AsyncioExecutor(concurrent.futures.Executor)`\r\n  - this is added/modified and tested; it works but one of the problems of the design is that it's not thread-safe because it spawns a thread to run the asyncio loop forever; there may be better ways to do this on a single thread\r\n\r\n\r\n### PR checklist\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Description above provides context of the change\r\n- [ ] Commit message contains [\\[AIRFLOW-XXXX\\]](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXXX) or `[AIRFLOW-XXXX]` for document-only changes\r\n- [ ] Unit tests coverage for changes (not needed for

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nPytest wasn't working on Windows as described in JIRA, now it is working.\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nMinor fix, tested manually on Windows 10. Windows isn't supported anyway so no need to do further detailed testing.\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [X] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate

think writing notes is a problem for developers, and it's not always helpful enough for end-users.

For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-6393\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nOnly lineage items obtained from XCom were rendered rather than\r\nall. Additionally source tasks are recorded.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nUpdated tests\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [X] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

is a hidden cyclic dependency between baseoperator and helpers module.\r\nIt's hidden by local import but it is detected when baseoperator/helpers are\r\nremoved from pylint_todo.txt (and it's really there).\r\n\r\nThe dependency comes from BaseOperator using helpers and two helpers methods\r\n(chain and cross_downstream) using BaseOperator. This can be solved by\r\nconverting the chain and cross_downstream methods to be static methods in\r\nBaseOperator class.\r\n\r\n- [x] Description above provides context of the change\r\n- [x] Commit

you try to run docs/build.sh script on bash included with macOS you wil get error that `mapfile` command is not present.\r\n\r\nThis is because macOS comes with bash 3.2.  You need >= 4.0 to run this script.\r\n\r\nAdding this note can save mac users some confusion.\r\n\r\nThey need to run `brew install bash` and enable the newer version in `/etc/shells`.\r\n\r\nMake sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-6360\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-6360\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-6360\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate

For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-6380\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the

In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate

For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-6376\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the
