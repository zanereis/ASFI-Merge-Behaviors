is to try to use a builder to build the ClusterManagementService directly instead of a config object. User can use the following to get the service:\r\n\r\nClusterManagementServiceBuilder.buildWithUrl().setUrl(host, port).build();\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\nClusterManagementServiceBuilder.buildWithCache().setCache(cache).build();\r\n\r\nThis fixed the following problem of config approach:\r\n1. user can call setCredentials(username, password) on both builders and still maintain the builder type.\r\n2. We can still keep ClientClusterManagementService in internal package, user doesn't have to new it explicitly.\r\n\r\nThe downside of this approach is `GeodeBuilder.setCache` method takes an Object, so the cache type check is at runtime, not at compile

solution causes each deployed jar to create it's own class loader and chains them together.\r\n\r\nThe class loaders are now child first class loaders and If a class cannot be found, it will search all 'sibling'/other deployed jars\r\n\r\nWhen a jar is redeployed (new version), we keep some meta data in a map so we no longer crawl the 'old' jar when possible and only search through the latest version of a specific jar.\r\n\r\nJava does some caching of classes and in the undeploy scenario, we may still be able to load classes that have been \"removed\" from the new jar (only if it was already cached by some other class loader).  This can happen when we have inter jar dependencies.\r\n\r\nGeode also caches classes, so whenever a redeploy occurs, the geode class cache gets wiped, and first lookups take a minor performance hit, but subsequent lookups go through geodes caching of the classes (so the for name and class lookups through chaining should have a minimal

is a _proof of concept,_ intended to provoke feedback about the approach. We will not merge this code into Geode as is. Whether this PoC or some other approach is accepted, we will test-drive a real implementation and submit a PR for that.\r\n\r\n# Goals for this PoC\r\n\r\nDemonstrate a way to:\r\n- Minimize the number of places in the code that have to know how to arrange for a given stat and meter to report the same values.\r\n  - Minimize how much the registry must know about stats.\r\n  - Minimize how much the stats must know about registries and meters.\r\n  - Minimize the number of places that know how to construct a given meter.\r\n  - Minimize the number of places that know how to associate a given stat with a meter.\r\n- Minimize the intrusiveness of instrumentation.\r\n- For performance, configure the cache’s meter registry to store values only for meters that supply stats, and to create no-op meters for all other meters.\r\n- Remove the relevant meters and stats when the measured thing (e.g. region) is removed.\r\n\r\n# Design Choices\r\n\r\n**Introduce the `XMeters` pattern.** For each instrumented class X, create an XMeters class that creates all meters for X, and encapsulates all knowledge of the associations between stats and meters. In particular, an XMeters class:\r\n\r\n- Constructs all meters for X and its instances.\r\n- Knows which stats and meters represent the same measurement.\r\n- When applicable, arranges for a given stat's value to be supplied from the relevant meter.\r\n- Exposes each meter via a method (for each X to use to instrument its code).\r\n- Reports the set of meter names that require real meters in the cache's meter registry. That is, the names of the meters that supply values for stats.\r\n\r\n**Changes to `StatisticsRegistry`.** The statistics registry creates a global set of meter names that require real meters in the cache's meter registry. It creates the set by aggregating the names from each `XMeters`.\r\n\r\n**The Storage Registry.** The `CacheMeterRegistryFactory` adds a `SimpleMeterRegistry` to the `CompositeMeterRegistry`. It adds a filter to the simple registry that accepts only meters whose names are reported by the `StatisticsRegistry`'s as requiring real meters. If the filter accepts a meter name, the registry creates a real meter that accumulates values. If the filter denies a meter name, the registry creates a no-op meter.\r\n\r\n**Instrumented Code.**  Each instrumented object constructs (or perhaps injects) an XMeters instance, and uses the instances meters for its instrumentation.\r\n\r\n# Example: Events Received by a Gateway Receiver\r\n\r\nWe used \"gateway receiver events received\" as our one example, because currently that is the only measurement that we record as both a meter and a stat.\r\n\r\nWe created a `GatewayReceiverMeters` class and used it to instrument the _events received_ meter. `GatewayReceiverMeters` creates the meter and arranges for it to supply the associated stat.\r\n\r\nGiven that our main goal was to demonstrate how to associate the meter and the stat _while minimizing the amount of code that knows about the association,_ we stopped when we had demonstrated that.\r\n\r\n# Limitations\r\n\r\nThis approach uses only meter _names_ to decide which kind of meter (real vs no-op) to create. In a comment on this PR, Jake raises a concern that this PoC does not address: That for some meters, we may want to base the decision on the value of a tag.\r\n\r\nThe `GatewayReceiverMeters` currently fails our \"remove the meters when you're done with them\" goal.\r\n\r\n# Opportunities Beyond this PoC\r\n\r\nAdopting the _XMeters pattern_ allows us to migrate all instrumentation for a particular class from stats to meters, while continuing to publish existing measurements to GFS files. Once any given instrument is created and configured in an XMeters object, and instrumented as a meter, we can change the details of where and how each measurement is reported without affecting the instrumented code.\r\n\r\n- If we want to publish a given measurement through _both GFS files and Micrometer:_ Create a meter in the registry, and arrange for the meter to supply the stat value, as in our `GatewayReceiverMeters` example.\r\n- If we want to publish a measurement _only through GFS_ files and _not through Micrometer:_ Don't use the cache's meter registry to create the meter. Instead, construct the meter directly. Then connect the meter to the stat.\r\n- If we want to publish a measurement _only through Micrometer_ and _not through GFS files:_ Create a meter in the registry, and don't connect it to a stat.\r\n- If we want to decide where to publish a measurement based on details of the instrumented object, the XMeters class can take the object as a parameter, and choose which of the above configurations to apply\r\n\r\nAll of these choices can be encapsulated in the relevant XMeters class.","created_at":"2019-05-01T18:11:11Z","updated_at":"2019-05-06T16:02:07Z","closed_at":"2019-05-04T00:42:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f905bce5621eed5337199229e3c373c54d0b8de5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/3534/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/3534/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/3534/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/statuses/02b6bb849fed8afdcf53df5a584cbb9fac028ee0","head":{"label":"demery-pivotal:dale/meter-stat-poc","ref":"dale/meter-stat-poc","sha":"02b6bb849fed8afdcf53df5a584cbb9fac028ee0","user":{"login":"demery-pivotal","id":45369324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzY5MzI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45369324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal","html_url":"https://github.com/demery-pivotal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":159222461,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTkyMjI0NjE=","name":"geode","full_name":"demery-pivotal/geode","private":false,"owner":{"login":"demery-pivotal","id":45369324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzY5MzI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45369324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal","html_url":"https://github.com/demery-pivotal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/demery-pivotal/geode","description":"Apache

am using this PR as an example of a proposal to deprecate current timeout APIs with new APIs that take `TimeUnit`.\r\n\r\nCurrent APIs leave an ambiguity when coding as to what the unit of time is. You must consult the documentation to determine the time unit. Many of the APIs like this documentation. Making things worse there isn't consistency throughout the API, some are in seconds, others milliseconds. Adding `TimeUnit` to these APIs removes the ambiguity since the caller dictates the time unit.\r\n\r\nIt also produces more readable code. Consider `setSocketConnectTimeout(86400000)` vs. `setSocketConnectTimeout(1, DAYS)`.\r\n\r\nThe goal would be to slowly add `TimeUnit` to all public APIs, and deprecate the original, as we are working in an area of code.\r\n\r\nA similar task has already been completed in [geode-native](http://github.com/apache/geode-native).\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-01T05:23:24Z","updated_at":"2019-06-05T19:00:24Z","closed_at":"2019-06-05T18:50:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"63a8ae0d02eccd733f1a33caab91268b947fb96b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"kirklund","id":1444301,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDQzMDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1444301?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund","html_url":"https://github.com/kirklund","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirklund/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"metatype","id":2790361,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3OTAzNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2790361?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/metatype","html_url":"https://github.com/metatype","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metatype/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metatype/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metatype/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metatype/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metatype/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metatype/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metatype/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metatype/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metatype/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/3530/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/3530/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/3530/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/statuses/98e5e9b20ebbcf4b2db26eb20341b7b15e5c98c8","head":{"label":"jake-at-work:wip/timeunit","ref":"wip/timeunit","sha":"98e5e9b20ebbcf4b2db26eb20341b7b15e5c98c8","user":{"login":"jake-at-work","id":6800791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4MDA3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6800791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work","html_url":"https://github.com/jake-at-work","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":79155582,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3OTE1NTU4Mg==","name":"geode","full_name":"jake-at-work/geode","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jake-at-work","id":6800791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4MDA3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6800791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work","html_url":"https://github.com/jake-at-work","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jake-at-work/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jake-at-work/geode","description":"Mirror

PR contains all of the refactoring, cleanup, and unit testing of GatewayReceiver, CacheServer, and Acceptor code without adding any new GatewayReceiver meters.\r\n\r\nThese changes also include removing the isGatewayReceiver boolean from CacheServerImpl and introducing new Builder classes for CacheServerImpl (ServerBuilder) and AcceptorImpl (AcceptorBuilder). Tons of new unit tests are added.\r\n\r\nTHE BEST STARTING POINT is to look at GemFireCacheImpl which now uses ServerBuilder to create CacheServer or GatewayReceiver Server. Then follow into ServerBuilder and AcceptorBuilder. AcceptorImpl still has isGatewayReceiver (which I didn't add) but CacheServerImpl no longer knows anything about gateways (and no longer has isGatewayReceiver).\r\n\r\nNext steps: I think the next step would be to make additional changes that allow CacheServerStats (aka GatewayReceiverStats) to be injected via constructors through CacheServerImpl and then into AcceptorImpl. I'm not sure how to make AcceptorImpl unaware of the List of GatewayTransportFilters though -- that'll be much more challenging.\r\n\r\nI'd like to continue working on cleaning up more of this area but (a) I really want to merge these changes in before I hit many more conflicts and (b) I need to balance cleanup with team stories.\r\n\r\nPlease review: @demery-pivotal @mhansonp @aaronlindsey
