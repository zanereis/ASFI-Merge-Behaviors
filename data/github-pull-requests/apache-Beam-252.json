sure to do all of the following to help us incorporate your contribution\r\nquickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure the PR title is formatted like:\r\n   `[BEAM-<Jira issue #>] Description of pull request`\r\n - [x] Make sure tests pass via `mvn clean verify`. (Even better, enable\r\n       Travis-CI on your fork and ensure the whole test matrix passes).\r\n - [x] Replace `<Jira issue #>` in the title with the actual Jira issue\r\n       number, if there is one.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache\r\n       [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.txt).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBefore this change, `ProcessContext` and `Context` were special-cased, while other parameters were treated generically. After this change, all parameters receive the same dynamic treatment. Thus a user need not request these parameters, the runner can save the effort of constructing them, and we can migrate towards less \"all-in-one\" parameters.\r\n\r\nI changed only the analysis and code generation a bit to remove special casing, but did not write new delegations that would actually add dynamic parameter generation to methods that do not already have them, so only `@ProcessElement` and `@OnTimer` are affected.","created_at":"2016-11-12T05:04:13Z","updated_at":"2016-11-22T21:59:36Z","closed_at":"2016-11-15T06:10:56Z","merged_at":"2016-11-15T06:10:56Z","merge_commit_sha":"f03b8e77f200e7a0ff8f148631808e46e62cfbfc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/1355/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/1355/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/1355/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/f03b8e77f200e7a0ff8f148631808e46e62cfbfc","head":{"label":"kennknowles:ProcessContext","ref":"ProcessContext","sha":"f03b8e77f200e7a0ff8f148631808e46e62cfbfc","user":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52646147,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MjY0NjE0Nw==","name":"beam","full_name":"kennknowles/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles/beam","description":"Mirror

Some context:\r\n    * The existing shading is broken (modules that depend on this one cannot use it successfully).\r\n    * Hadoop's use of reflection in several instances makes shading the dependency \"in a good way\" nearly impossible. It requires a couple of rather brittle hacks, and, for clients that depend on certain conflicting versions of hadoop these hacks can mean it doesn't meet its intended goal of preventing conflicts anyway.\r\n    * From what I can tell, there's no good way to shade this to make it universally usable, so leaving it unshaded seems like a reasonable default.\r\n    * Without shading Hadoop, this module can be successfully used from Beam's wordcount example (which actually does have pre-existing hadoop dependencies already).","created_at":"2016-11-09T22:27:19Z","updated_at":"2016-12-14T00:05:25Z","closed_at":"2016-12-13T23:56:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"53e876e9734514748eda4777d934513e4258331c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/1327/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/1327/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/1327/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/3b43af4ee9506bfdb42361e0d44b9231da9ac74c","head":{"label":"mizitch:sorter-gcs","ref":"sorter-gcs","sha":"3b43af4ee9506bfdb42361e0d44b9231da9ac74c","user":{"login":"mizitch","id":16655282,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NjU1Mjgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16655282?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mizitch","html_url":"https://github.com/mizitch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mizitch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mizitch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mizitch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mizitch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mizitch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mizitch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mizitch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mizitch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mizitch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":71498342,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3MTQ5ODM0Mg==","name":"incubator-beam","full_name":"mizitch/incubator-beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mizitch","id":16655282,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NjU1Mjgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16655282?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mizitch","html_url":"https://github.com/mizitch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mizitch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mizitch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mizitch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mizitch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mizitch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mizitch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mizitch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mizitch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mizitch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mizitch/incubator-beam","description":"Mirror

(Even better, enable\r\n       Travis-CI on your fork and ensure the whole test matrix passes).\r\n - [x] Replace `<Jira issue #>` in the title with the actual Jira issue\r\n       number, if there is one.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache\r\n       [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.txt).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nR: @tgroh \r\n\r\nAs you requested for a followup on the `OnTimerInvoker` PR. The two commits are independent but both address the same issue. This is an operation no-op (unless something went wrong).\r\n\r\n - For `DoFnSignatures` I decided there was only likely to ever be one canonical way to create a `DoFnSignature, so it was merely a matter of changes one or two non-`static` methods to `static`.\r\n - For the invokers, it is very easy to imagine experiments with different kinds of invokers, so I made the factory interfaces explicit, as you suggested.\r\n\r\nBEAM-941 has a couple more longstanding occurrences that I did not address here:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ find . -name '*.java' | xargs grep
