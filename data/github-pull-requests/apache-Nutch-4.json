Handle Google Cloud Storage URLs as crawldb inputs in domainstats,\r\n  protocolstats and crawlcomplete commands.\r\n- Correctly resolve numReducers in protocolstats.\r\n- Align crawlcomplete

But I am not too worried, test-core pass.\r\nAlso, these changes are not super high quality in the sense that ideally I would have added some helper to enforce path manipulations which work with URLs, for all commands. Now, I do not think these commands deserve so much work so:\r\n\r\n- I just copy/paste \"Path\" manipulations used in other commands like CrawlDBReader which I know work locally and in GCS. Then run the commands in GCP and some of them again locally just to be sure I did not break everything. I do not know Java API well enough to decide if the path manipulations make sense, I just know they work.\r\n- I spotted the numReducers issue while reading the code. I did not test it. It is obviously a copy/paste from domainstats to protocolstats.","created_at":"2020-06-09T15:54:59Z","updated_at":"2020-06-11T11:21:20Z","closed_at":"2020-06-11T11:21:20Z","merged_at":"2020-06-11T11:21:19Z","merge_commit_sha":"59d0d9532abdac409e123ab103a506cfb0df790a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nutch/pulls/533/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nutch/pulls/533/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nutch/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nutch/issues/533/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nutch/statuses/6b6e74c5a33c74ec30e3691c04797e6742350456","head":{"label":"pmezard:NUTCH-2791","ref":"NUTCH-2791","sha":"6b6e74c5a33c74ec30e3691c04797e6742350456","user":{"login":"pmezard","id":1430779,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzA3Nzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1430779?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmezard","html_url":"https://github.com/pmezard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmezard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmezard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmezard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmezard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmezard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmezard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmezard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmezard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmezard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":271033472,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzEwMzM0NzI=","name":"nutch","full_name":"pmezard/nutch","private":false,"owner":{"login":"pmezard","id":1430779,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzA3Nzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1430779?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmezard","html_url":"https://github.com/pmezard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmezard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmezard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmezard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmezard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmezard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmezard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmezard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmezard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmezard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/pmezard/nutch","description":"Apache

PR obsoletes #95 (parts of the work are already done in [NUTCH-2456](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NUTCH-2456)/#240).

expected to be the CrawlDb unless `-nocrawldb` is given\r\n- it picks various improvements from PR #95\r\n- and improves the command-line help:\r\n```\r\nUsage: Indexer (<crawldb> | -nocrawldb) (<segment> ... | -dir <segments>) [general options]\r\n\r\nIndex given segments using configured indexer plugins\r\n\r\nThe CrawlDb is optional but it is required to send deletion requests for duplicates\r\nand to read the proper document score/boost/weight passed to the indexers.\r\n\r\nRequired arguments:\r\n\r\n        <crawldb>       path to CrawlDb, or\r\n        -nocrawldb      flag to indicate that no CrawlDb shall be used\r\n\r\n        <segment> ...   path(s) to segment, or\r\n        -dir <segments> path to segments/ directory,\r\n                        (all subdirectories are read as segments)\r\n\r\nGeneral options:\r\n\r\n        -linkdb <linkdb>        use LinkDb to index anchor texts of incoming links\r\n        -params k1=v1&k2=v2...  parameters passed to indexer

deletion requests for 404s, redirects, duplicates\r\n        -filter         skip documents with URL rejected by configured URL filters\r\n        -normalize      normalize URLs before indexing\r\n        -addBinaryContent       index raw/binary content in field `binaryContent`\r\n        -base64         use Base64 encoding for binary
