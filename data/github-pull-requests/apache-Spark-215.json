If the Web UI is accessed before this info's being written to `InMemoryStore`, the following `NoSuchElementException` will be thrown.\r\n```\r\n WARN org.eclipse.jetty.server.HttpChannel: /jobs/\r\n

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe `Kafka*Suite`s are flaky because of the Hadoop MiniKdc issue - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-12656\r\n> Looking at MiniKdc implementation, if port is 0, the constructor use ServerSocket to find an unused port, assign the port number to the member variable port and close the ServerSocket object; later, in initKDCServer(), instantiate a TcpTransport object and bind at that port.\r\n\r\n> It appears that the port may be used in between, and then throw the exception.\r\n\r\nRelated test failures are suspected,  such as

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSkip timestamps rebasing after a global threshold when there is no difference between Julian and Gregorian calendars. This allows to avoid checking hash maps of switch points, and fixes perf regressions in `toJavaTimestamp()` and `fromJavaTimestamp()`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe changes fix perf regressions of conversions to/from external type `java.sql.Timestamp`.\r\n\r\nBefore (see the PR's results https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28440):\r\n```\r\n================================================================================================\r\nConversion from/to external types\r\n================================================================================================\r\n\r\nOpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM 1.8.0_252-8u252-b09-1~18.04-b09 on Linux 4.15.0-1063-aws\r\nIntel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2670 v2 @ 2.50GHz\r\nTo/from Java's date-time:                 Best Time(ms)   Avg Time(ms)   Stdev(ms)    Rate(M/s)   Per Row(ns)   Relative\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nFrom java.sql.Timestamp                             376            388          10         13.3          75.2       1.1X\r\nCollect java.sql.Timestamp                         1878           1937          64          2.7         375.6       0.2X\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n```\r\n================================================================================================\r\nConversion from/to external types\r\n================================================================================================\r\n\r\nOpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM 1.8.0_252-8u252-b09-1~18.04-b09 on Linux 4.15.0-1063-aws\r\nIntel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2670 v2 @ 2.50GHz\r\nTo/from Java's date-time:                 Best Time(ms)   Avg Time(ms)   Stdev(ms)    Rate(M/s)   Per Row(ns)   Relative\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nFrom java.sql.Timestamp                             249            264          24         20.1          49.8       1.7X\r\nCollect java.sql.Timestamp                         1503           1523          24          3.3         300.5       0.3X\r\n```\r\n\r\nPerf improvements in average of:\r\n\r\n1.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n* Pagination Support is added to all tables of streaming page in spark web UI.\r\nFor adding pagination support, existing classes from #7399 were used.\r\n* Earlier streaming page has two tables `Active Batches` and `Completed Batches`. Now, we will have three tables `Running Batches`, `Waiting Batches` and `Completed Batches`. If we have large number of waiting and running batches then keeping track in a single table is difficult. Also other pages have different table for different type type of data.\r\n* Earlier empty tables were shown. Now only non-empty tables will be shown.\r\n`Active Batches` table used to show details of waiting batches followed by running batches. \r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nPagination will allow users to analyse the table in much better way. All spark web UI pages support pagination apart from streaming pages, so this will add consistency as well. Also it might fix the potential OOM errors that can arise. \r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. `Active Batches` table is split into two tables `Running Batches` and `Waiting Batches`. Pagination Support is added to the all the tables. Every other functionality is unchanged.\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUT added.\r\n\r\nBefore changes:\r\n<img width=\"1667\" alt=\"Screenshot 2020-05-03 at 7 07 14 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15366835/80915680-8fb44b80-8d71-11ea-9957-c4a3769b8b67.png\">\r\n\r\nAfter Changes:\r\n<img width=\"1677\" alt=\"Screenshot 2020-06-01 at 11 26 48 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15366835/83960194-89028200-a8a3-11ea-8d5c-12ec7c2ca34f.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAllow customized timeouts for `runSparkSubmit`, which will make flaky tests more likely to pass by using a larger timeout value.\r\n\r\nI was able to reproduce the test failure on my laptop, which took 1.5 - 2 minutes to finish the test. After increasing the timeout, the test now can pass locally.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis allows slow tests to use a larger timeout, so they are more likely to succeed.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nThe test was able to pass on my local env after the change.","created_at":"2020-05-03T00:14:59Z","updated_at":"2020-05-04T05:51:28Z","closed_at":"2020-05-04T05:50:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"699ad772a53acf00fbc7559471a405530f66ee92","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28438/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28438/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28438/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/527614681b74dd591f4cef1b3471e6d00240e6a1","head":{"label":"tianshizz:SPARK-31267","ref":"SPARK-31267","sha":"527614681b74dd591f4cef1b3471e6d00240e6a1","user":{"login":"tianshizz","id":1372267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzIyNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1372267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tianshizz","html_url":"https://github.com/tianshizz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tianshizz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tianshizz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tianshizz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tianshizz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tianshizz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tianshizz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tianshizz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tianshizz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tianshizz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":260797155,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjA3OTcxNTU=","name":"spark","full_name":"tianshizz/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tianshizz","id":1372267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzIyNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1372267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tianshizz","html_url":"https://github.com/tianshizz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tianshizz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tianshizz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tianshizz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tianshizz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tianshizz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tianshizz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tianshizz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tianshizz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tianshizz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tianshizz/spark","description":"Mirror

thread.\r\n\r\nJetty's acceptor thread waits for a new connection request and blocked by `accept(this.fd, newfd, isaa)` in [`sun.nio.ch.ServerSocketChannelImpl#accept`](http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk8/jdk8/jdk/file/tip/src/share/classes/sun/nio/ch/ServerSocketChannelImpl.java#l241).\r\n\r\nWhen `org.eclipse.jetty.server.Server.doStop` is called in the main thread, the thread reaches [this code](http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk8/jdk8/jdk/file/tip/src/share/classes/sun/nio/ch/ServerSocketChannelImpl.java#l280).  \r\n\r\nThe server socket descriptor will be closed by `nd.preClose` in the main thread.\r\nThen, `accept()` in acceptor thread throws an Exception due to \"Bad file descriptor\" in case of macOS.\r\nAfter the exception is thrown, the acceptor thread will continue to [fetch a task](https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/blob/jetty-9.4.18.v20190429/jetty-util/src/main/java/org/eclipse/jetty/util/thread/QueuedThreadPool.java#L783).\r\nIf the thread obtain the `SHRINK` task [here](https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/blob/jetty-9.4.18.v20190429/jetty-util/src/main/java/org/eclipse/jetty/util/thread/QueuedThreadPool.java#L854), the thread will be shrink.\r\nIf, the acceptor thread finishes before `NativeThread.signal` is called in the main thread, this issue happens.\r\n\r\nI have confirmed this issue happens even `jetty-9.4.28.v20200408`.\r\nBecause the stack trace is displayed by the [logger](https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/blob/jetty-9.4.18.v20190429/jetty-server/src/main/java/org/eclipse/jetty/server/ServerConnector.java#L372), it's difficult to suppress it.\r\nAccording to [this condition](https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/blob/jetty-9.4.18.v20190429/jetty-util/src/main/java/org/eclipse/jetty/util/thread/QueuedThreadPool.java#L842), shrink doesn't happen if the idle time is 0. So this PR adds a workaround that set the idle time to 0 immediately before stop.\r\n\r\nIn case of Linux, the acceptor thread is still blocked by `accept` even though `np.preClose` is called in the main thread.\r\nThe acceptor thread will return from `accept` when `NativeThread.signal` is called in the main thread.\r\nIt seems that the implementation of `accept systemcall` called in `accept` is different between Linux and macOS.\r\nSo, I believe this issue doesn't happen on Linux.\r\n\r\nAlso, the implementation of `NativeThread.signal` is a little bit changed in [OpenJDK 9](http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk9/jdk9/jdk/rev/7b17bff2ea36) for macOS.\r\nSo this issue doesn't happen for macOS with OpenJDK 9+.\r\n\r\nYou can reproduce this issue by following instructions using debugger.\r\n\r\n1. Launch spark-shell in local mode with JDWP enabled.\r\n2. Access to WebUI. This is needed to increase the number of SparkUI thread to greater than minThreads to meet the condition of shrink.\r\n3. Enable the following breakpoints. Note that don't suspend all threads when a thread reaches one of the breakpoints. Only the threads which reach the line should be suspended. \r\n  3.1 [long now = System.nanoTime(); at org.eclipse.jetty.util.thread.QueuedThreadPool#idleJobPoll](https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/blob/jetty-9.4.18.v20190429/jetty-util/src/main/java/org/eclipse/jetty/util/thread/QueuedThreadPool.java#L850)\r\n  3.2 [NativeThread.signal(th); at sun.nio.ch.ServerSocketChannelImpl#implCloseSelectableChannel](http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk8/jdk8/jdk/file/tip/src/share/classes/sun/nio/ch/ServerSocketChannelImpl.java#l283)\r\n  3.3 [thread = 0; at ServerSocketChannelImpl#accept](http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk8/jdk8/jdk/file/tip/src/share/classes/sun/nio/ch/ServerSocketChannelImpl.java#l247)\r\n4. Quit spark-shell.\r\n5.  Waiting for a thread reaching the breakpoint `3.1` and until the following condition become true (The idle time of those threads are 1min and you can confirm it using the expression evaluation feature if your debugger supports ).   \r\n`(System.nanoTime() - last) > TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS.toNanos(_idleTimeout)`\r\n6. The acceptor thread named `SparkUI-<N>-acceptor-0` should be suspended at the breakpoint `3.3` so continue this thread. This thread will reach the breakpoint at `3.1` and continue further. Then, the acceptor thread will be shrink.\r\n7. Continue all the threads rest.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis stack trace is not brought by Spark but it confuses users.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nTested by the reproduce procedure above and confirmed acceptor thread is no longer

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently, an application is unregistered from YARN RM in a shutdown hook. In the scenario where the shutdown hook does not run (e.g., timeouts, etc.), the application is not unregistered, resulting in YARN RM resubmitting the application even if it succeeded.\r\n\r\nFor example, you could see the following on the driver log:\r\n```\r\n20/04/30 06:20:29 INFO SparkContext: Successfully stopped SparkContext\r\n20/04/30 06:20:29 INFO ApplicationMaster: Final app status: SUCCEEDED, exitCode: 0\r\n20/04/30 06:20:59 WARN ShutdownHookManager: ShutdownHook '$anon$2' timeout, java.util.concurrent.TimeoutException\r\njava.util.concurrent.TimeoutException\r\n\tat java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.get(FutureTask.java:205)\r\n\tat org.apache.hadoop.util.ShutdownHookManager.executeShutdown(ShutdownHookManager.java:124)\r\n\tat org.apache.hadoop.util.ShutdownHookManager$1.run(ShutdownHookManager.java:95)\r\n```\r\nYou can see that the final app status is `SUCCEEDED`. However, on the YARN RM side:\r\n```\r\n020-04-30 06:21:25,083 INFO RMContainerImpl: container_1588227360159_0001_01_000001 Container Transitioned from RUNNING to COMPLETED\r\n2020-04-30 06:21:25,085 INFO RMAppAttemptImpl: Updating application attempt appattempt_1588227360159_0001_000001 with final state: FAILED, and exit status: 0\r\n2020-04-30 06:21:25,085 INFO RMAppAttemptImpl: appattempt_1588227360159_0001_000001 State change from RUNNING to FINAL_SAVING on event = CONTAINER_FINISHED\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou see that the final state of the application becomes `FAILED` since the container is finished before the application is unregistered.\r\n\r\nThis could be misleading and this PR proposes to unregister the application right away if it succeeds.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo fix a bug where application is not unregistered even if it succeeds.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. If the application succeeds, it will be unregistered even if the shutdown hook doesn't get run.\r\n\r\nThe following is YARN RM log when there was a timeout on the shutdown hook after the fix:\r\n```\r\n2020-05-02 02:13:02,222 INFO RMContainerImpl: container_1588385278256_0001_01_000001 Container Transitioned from RUNNING to COMPLETED\r\n2020-05-02 02:13:02,222 INFO ApplicationMasterService: Unregistering app attempt : appattempt_1588385278256_0001_000001\r\n2020-05-02 02:13:02,224 INFO RMAppAttemptImpl: appattempt_1588385278256_0001_000001 State change from FINISHING to FINISHED on event = CONTAINER_FINISHED\r\n2020-05-02 02:13:02,226 INFO RMAppImpl: application_1588385278256_0001 State change from FINISHING to FINISHED on event = ATTEMPT_FINISHED\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdded a test that covers the scenario where spark context is not stopped by the user application.\r\n\r\nThe scenario where shutdown hook timeouts is manually tested.","created_at":"2020-05-02T03:00:30Z","updated_at":"2020-07-07T20:51:29Z","closed_at":"2020-07-07T20:51:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ecc04ffde3aeb625c80fb829a5a39e9f6e666333","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1427970157,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDI3OTcwMTU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/YARN","name":"YARN","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28435/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28435/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28435/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/079fcbc1665ff88c2ff31d498574ce766edf0ce1","head":{"label":"imback82:yarn_am","ref":"yarn_am","sha":"079fcbc1665ff88c2ff31d498574ce766edf0ce1","user":{"login":"imback82","id":12103644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTAzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12103644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82","html_url":"https://github.com/imback82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":190453549,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTA0NTM1NDk=","name":"spark-4","full_name":"imback82/spark-4","private":false,"owner":{"login":"imback82","id":12103644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTAzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12103644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82","html_url":"https://github.com/imback82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/imback82/spark-4","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSHOW TBLPROPERTIES does not get the correct table properties for tables using the Session Catalog. This PR fixes that, by explicitly falling back to the V1 implementation if the table is in fact a V1 table. We also hide the reserved table properties for V2 tables, as users do not have control over setting these table properties. Henceforth, if they cannot be set or controlled by the user, then they shouldn't be displayed as such.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nShows the incorrect table properties, i.e. only what exists in the Hive MetaStore for V2 tables that may have table properties outside of the MetaStore.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nFixes a bug\r\n\r\n### How

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd new benchmarks to `DateTimeRebaseBenchmark` for reading/writing timestamps of INT96 and TIMESTAMP_MICROS column types. Here are benchmark results for reading timestamps after 1582 year with default settings (rebasing is off for TIMESTAMP_MICROS/TIMESTAMP_MILLIS,  and rebasing on for INT96):\r\n\r\ntimestamp type | vectorized off (ns/row) | vectorized on (ns/row)\r\n--|--|--\r\nTIMESTAMP_MICROS| 160.1 | 50.2\r\nINT96 | 215.6 | 117.8\r\nTIMESTAMP_MILLIS | 159.9 | 60.6\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo compare default timestamp type `TIMESTAMP_MICROS` with other types in the case if an user decides to switch on them.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the benchmarks via:\r\n```\r\nSPARK_GENERATE_BENCHMARK_FILES=1 build/sbt \"sql/test:runMain

If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFixing an issue where Spark Master UI Fails to load if the application is waiting for workers to launch driver.\r\n\r\n**Root Cause:**\r\nThis is happening due to the fact that the submitted application is waiting for a worker to be free to run the driver. Due to this resource is set to null in the formatResourcesAddresses method and this is running into null pointer exception.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31816865/80801557-77ee9300-8bca-11ea-92b7-b8df58b68de3.png)\r\n\r\n**Fix:**\r\nAdded a null check before forming a resource address and display \"None\" if the driver isn't launched yet.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSpark Master UI should load as expected when applications are waiting for workers to run driver.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nThe worker column in Spark Master UI will show \"None\" if the driver hasn't been launched yet.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31816865/80801671-be43f200-8bca-11ea-86c3-381925f82cc7.png)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTested on a local setup. Launched 2 applications and ensured that Spark Master UI loads fine.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31816865/80801883-5b9f2600-8bcb-11ea-8a1a-cc597aabc4c2.png)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nReplaceIntersectWithSemiJoin catalyst optimizer rule replaces Intersect with Distinct followed by LeftSemi Join. In some cases, pushing the distinct down the join can give improvements. This PR adds support for the same based on Stats.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nPushing the Distinct down in cases when it converts the join to broadcast join or in cases when it reduces the rows by some fraction can be more performant. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nAdded a new config \"spark.sql.cbo.optimizeIntersect.enabled\" which triggers this cost based optimization.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded UTs.\r\n\r\nPerformance Benchmarking\r\nSQL query over TPCDS 1000 scale data:\r\n _(select ss_item_sk  from store_sales)

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new option, `inputRetention` to provide a way to specify retention on input files.\r\n\r\n`maxAgeMs` plays as `soft` limit (it doesn't apply for some conditions like first batch, as well as it's applied relatively to the modified time of input files). Given it's not consistently applied across the matrix of configurations, Spark cannot purge the entries based on the configuration. (Streaming query can change the configurations and be relaunched.)\r\n\r\n`inputRetention` plays as `hard` limit - Spark will not include files older than the retention as input files, as well as tries to exclude file entries older than the retention (it actually happens on compaction, as it's the only phase to remove entries).\r\n\r\n`inputRetention` is relative to the system timestamp unlike `maxAgeMs`, which is easier for end users to reason about. This would require end users to correctly set the nodes' timestamp, but in most cases they would do it in other reasons as well. Also, this would filter out old files when the query intends to replay from input files, hence this should be considered as well.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis has been a pain to deal with metadata growing in both file stream source and file stream sink. For file stream source, all processed input files are tracked which size is continuously growing, and there's no approach on reducing the size/entries. In compact batch, it reads all previous input files to write new compact file, which brings major latency. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nThis doesn't bring any change \"by default\", as the new configuration is optional. (The default value is set to unrealistic one making it effectively none.)\r\n\r\nThis adds a new configuration - previous sections described the behavior.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew UTs verifying two behaviors per test. \r\n\r\n1) old files should not be included as input files if input retention is specified\r\n2) when compacting, outdated entries should be filtered out \r\n\r\nI've manually tested with above two behaviors as well.","created_at":"2020-04-30T12:17:28Z","updated_at":"2021-05-21T01:27:32Z","closed_at":"2021-05-21T01:27:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4a2ee903e588a395611c2908dc7e977dc53c9daa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5.

In this PR, we re-implement the `sql` methods of  the RuntimeReplaceable ones with toPettySQL\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n\r\nConsistency of schema output between RuntimeReplaceable expressions and normal ones.\r\n\r\nFor example, `date_format` vs `to_timestamp`, before this PR, they output differently\r\n\r\n#### Before\r\n```sql\r\nselect date_format(timestamp '2019-10-06', 'yyyy-MM-dd uuuu')\r\nstruct<date_format(TIMESTAMP '2019-10-06 00:00:00', yyyy-MM-dd uuuu):string>\r\n\r\nselect to_timestamp(\"2019-10-06S10:11:12.12345\", \"yyyy-MM-dd'S'HH:mm:ss.SSSSSS\")\r\nstruct<to_timestamp('2019-10-06S10:11:12.12345', 'yyyy-MM-dd\\'S\\'HH:mm:ss.SSSSSS'):timestamp>\r\n```\r\n#### After\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nselect date_format(timestamp '2019-10-06', 'yyyy-MM-dd uuuu')\r\nstruct<date_format(TIMESTAMP '2019-10-06 00:00:00', yyyy-MM-dd uuuu):string>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nselect to_timestamp(\"2019-10-06T10:11:12'12\", \"yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss''SSSS\")\r\n\r\nstruct<to_timestamp(2019-10-06T10:11:12'12, yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss''SSSS):timestamp>\r\n\r\n````\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, the schema output style changed for the runtime replaceable expressions as shown in the above example\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nregenerate all related tests\r\n","created_at":"2020-04-30T07:49:50Z","updated_at":"2020-05-11T11:42:31Z","closed_at":"2020-05-07T05:40:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b57661a3bbb258913d34f6a266dc918924c7c0d4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28420/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28420/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28420/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5843ac6a41573bb80482aca27069dbd5baf81d5c","head":{"label":"yaooqinn:SPARK-31615","ref":"SPARK-31615","sha":"5843ac6a41573bb80482aca27069dbd5baf81d5c","user":{"login":"yaooqinn","id":8326978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjY5Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8326978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn","html_url":"https://github.com/yaooqinn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"7195a18bf24d9506d2f8d9d4d93ff679b3d21b65","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

be consistent with format. brackets [ and ] indicate optional parts, and dots ... mean that the \r\n// preceding element can be repeated.\r\n- col_spec [ , col_spec ... ] -> col_spec [ , ... ] // same as above, be consistent with format.\r\n- [USING data_source] -> [ USING data_source ] // be consistent with format. space between [ and text\r\n- change function_name format to make it consistent with others\r\n- from -> FROM // uppercase keyword\r\n- { { VALUES ( { value | NULL } [ , ... ] ) [ , ( ... ) ] } | query } ->  { VALUES ( { value | NULL } [ , ... ] ) [ , ( ... ) ] | query } // remove unnecessary { } \r\n- DROP ( DATABASE | SCHEMA ) -> DROP { DATABASE | SCHEMA } \r\n// Braces { and } and vertical lines | indicate that you must choose one alternative\r\n- fix a few link and

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd a new class HybridStore to make the history server faster when loading event files. When rebuilding the application state from event logs, HybridStore will write data to InMemoryStore at first and use a background thread to dump data to LevelDB once the writing to InMemoryStore is completed. HybridStore is to make content serving faster by using more memory. It's only safe to enable it when the cluster is not having a heavy load.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nHybridStore can greatly reduce the event logs loading time, especially for large log files. In general, it has 4x - 6x UI loading speed improvement for large log files. The detailed result is shown in comments.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nThis PR adds new configs `spark.history.store.hybridStore.enabled` and `spark.history.store.hybridStore.maxMemoryUsage`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nA test suite for HybridStore is added. I also manually tested it on 3.1.0 on mac os.\r\n\r\nThis is a follow-up for the work done by Hieu Huynh in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWe are adding a new Spark Yarn configuration, `spark.yarn.populateHadoopClasspath` to not populate Hadoop classpath from `yarn.application.classpath` and `mapreduce.application.classpath`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSpark Yarn client populates extra Hadoop classpath from `yarn.application.classpath` and `mapreduce.application.classpath` when a job is submitted to a Yarn Hadoop cluster.\r\n\r\nHowever, for `with-hadoop` Spark build that embeds Hadoop runtime, it can cause jar conflicts because Spark distribution can contain different version of Hadoop jars.\r\n\r\nOne case we have is when a user uses an Apache Spark distribution with its-own embedded hadoop, and submits a job to Cloudera or Hortonworks Yarn clusters, because of two different incompatible Hadoop jars in the classpath, it runs into errors.\r\n\r\nBy not populating the Hadoop classpath from the clusters can address this issue.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAn UT is added, but very hard to add a new integration test since this requires using different incompatible versions of Hadoop.\r\n\r\nWe also manually tested this PR, and we are able to submit a Spark job using Spark distribution built with Apache Hadoop 2.10 to CDH 5.6 without populating CDH classpath.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nReplace current implementation of `getOffsetFromLocalMillis()` by the code from JDK https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-jdk8u/blob/aa318070b27849f1fe00d14684b2a40f7b29bf79/jdk/src/share/classes/java/util/GregorianCalendar.java#L2795-L2801:\r\n```java\r\n            if (zone instanceof ZoneInfo) {\r\n                ((ZoneInfo)zone).getOffsetsByWall(millis, zoneOffsets);\r\n            } else {\r\n                int gmtOffset = isFieldSet(fieldMask, ZONE_OFFSET) ?\r\n                                    internalGet(ZONE_OFFSET) : zone.getRawOffset();\r\n                zone.getOffsets(millis - gmtOffset, zoneOffsets);\r\n            }\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrent domestic implementation of `getOffsetFromLocalMillis()` is incompatible with other date-time functions used from JDK's `GregorianCalendar` like `ZoneInfo.getOffsets`, and can return wrong results as it is demonstrated in SPARK-31449. For example, currently the function returns 1h offset but JDK function 0h:\r\n```\r\nEurope/Paris 1916-10-01 23:50:39.0 3600000 0\r\n```\r\nActually, the timestamp is in a DST interval of shifting wall clocks by 1 hour back\r\n\r\n\r\nYear | Date & Time | Abbreviation | Time Change | Offset After\r\n-- | -- | -- | -- | --\r\n1916 |Tue, 14 Jun, 23:00 | WET → WEST | +1 hour (DST start) | UTC+1h\r\n1916 |Sun, 2 Oct, 00:00 | WEST → WET | -1 hour (DST end) | UTC\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd according the default JDK policy, the latest timestamp should be taken in the case of overlapping but current implementation takes the earliest one. That makes it incompatible with other JDK calls.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, see differences in SPARK-31449.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy existing test suite `DateTimeUtilsSuite`, `DateFunctionsSuite` and

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to fix two legacy timestamp formatter `LegacySimpleTimestampFormatter` and `LegacyFastTimestampFormatter` to perform micros rebasing in parsing/formatting from/to strings. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nLegacy timestamps formatters operate on the hybrid calendar (Julian + Gregorian), so, the input micros should be rebased to have the same date-time fields as in Proleptic Gregorian calendar used by Spark SQL, see SPARK-26651.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded tests to `TimestampFormatterSuite`","created_at":"2020-04-29T17:46:22Z","updated_at":"2020-06-05T19:48:38Z","closed_at":"2020-04-30T12:45:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1e5abd28934f93f38d0339844d111ea3e509acdd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28408/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28408/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28408/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e966895be7044b7ad8bf7e4582497efcb60d113d","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:fix-rebasing-in-legacy-timestamp-formatter","ref":"fix-rebasing-in-legacy-timestamp-formatter","sha":"e966895be7044b7ad8bf7e4582497efcb60d113d","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIn `CTESubstitution`, resolve CTE relations first, then traverse the main plan only once to substitute CTE relations.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently we will traverse the main query many times (if there are many CTE relations), which can be pretty slow if the main query is large.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nlocal perf test\r\n```\r\nscala> :pa\r\n// Entering paste mode (ctrl-D to finish)\r\n\r\ndef test(i: Int): Unit = 1.to(i).foreach { _

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nPush the rebase logic to the lower level of the parquet vectorized reader, to make the final code more vectorization-friendly.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nParquet vectorized reader is carefully implemented, to make it more likely to be vectorized by the JVM. However, the newly added datetime rebase degrade the performance a lot, as it breaks vectorization, even if the datetime values don't need to rebase (this is very likely as dates before 1582 is rare).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nRun part of the `DateTimeRebaseBenchmark` locally.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to simplify the code of `InSet.sql` and create `Literal` instances directly from Catalyst's internal values by using the default `Literal` constructor.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis simplifies code and avoids unnecessary conversions to external types. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy existing test `SPARK-31563: sql of InSet for UTF8String collection` in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd a new logical node AggregateWithHaving, and the parser should create this plan for HAVING. The analyzer resolves it to Filter(..., Aggregate(...)).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe SQL parser in Spark creates Filter(..., Aggregate(...)) for the HAVING query, and Spark has a special analyzer rule ResolveAggregateFunctions to resolve the aggregate functions and grouping columns in the Filter operator.\r\n\r\nIt works for simple cases in a very tricky way as it relies on rule execution order:\r\n1. Rule ResolveReferences hits the Aggregate operator and resolves attributes inside aggregate functions, but the function itself is still unresolved as it's an UnresolvedFunction. This stops resolving the Filter operator as the child Aggrege operator is still unresolved.\r\n2. Rule ResolveFunctions resolves UnresolvedFunction. This makes the Aggrege operator resolved.\r\n3. Rule ResolveAggregateFunctions resolves the Filter operator if its child is a resolved Aggregate. This rule can correctly resolve the grouping columns.\r\n\r\nIn the example query, I put a datetime function `hour`, which needs to be resolved by rule ResolveTimeZone, which runs after ResolveAggregateFunctions. This breaks step 3 as the Aggregate operator is unresolved at that time. Then the analyzer starts next round and the Filter operator is resolved by ResolveReferences, which wrongly resolves the grouping columns.\r\n\r\nSee the demo below:\r\n```\r\nSELECT SUM(a) AS b, '2020-01-01 12:12:12' AS fake FROM VALUES (1, 10), (2, 20) AS T(a, b) GROUP BY b HAVING b > 10\r\n```\r\nThe query's result is\r\n```\r\n+---+-------------------+\r\n|  b|               fake|\r\n+---+-------------------+\r\n|  2|2020-01-01 12:12:12|\r\n+---+-------------------+\r\n```\r\nBut if we use `hour` function, it will return an empty result.\r\n```\r\nSELECT SUM(a) AS b,

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWith suggestion from @cloud-fan https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28222#issuecomment-620586933\r\n\r\nI Checked with both Presto and PostgresSQL, one is implemented intervals with ANSI style year-month/day-time, and the other is mixed and Non-ANSI. They both add the exceeded days in interval time part to the total days of the operation which extracts day from interval values.\r\n\r\n \r\n```sql\r\n\r\npresto> SELECT EXTRACT(DAY FROM (cast('2020-01-15 00:00:00' as timestamp) - cast('2020-01-01 00:00:00' as timestamp)));\r\n_col0\r\n-------\r\n14\r\n(1 row)\r\n\r\nQuery 20200428_135239_00000_ahn7x, FINISHED, 1 node\r\nSplits: 17 total, 17 done (100.00%)\r\n0:01 [0 rows, 0B] [0 rows/s, 0B/s]\r\n\r\npresto> SELECT EXTRACT(DAY FROM (cast('2020-01-15 00:00:00' as timestamp) - cast('2020-01-01 00:00:01' as timestamp)));\r\n_col0\r\n-------\r\n13\r\n(1 row)\r\n\r\nQuery 20200428_135246_00001_ahn7x, FINISHED, 1 node\r\nSplits: 17 total, 17 done (100.00%)\r\n0:00 [0 rows, 0B] [0 rows/s, 0B/s]\r\n\r\npresto>\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n```sql\r\n\r\npostgres=# SELECT EXTRACT(DAY FROM (cast('2020-01-15 00:00:00' as timestamp) - cast('2020-01-01 00:00:00' as timestamp)));\r\ndate_part\r\n-----------\r\n14\r\n(1 row)\r\n\r\npostgres=# SELECT EXTRACT(DAY FROM (cast('2020-01-15 00:00:00' as timestamp) - cast('2020-01-01 00:00:01' as timestamp)));\r\ndate_part\r\n-----------\r\n13\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nspark-sql> SELECT EXTRACT(DAY FROM (cast('2020-01-15 00:00:00' as timestamp) - cast('2020-01-01 00:00:01' as timestamp)));\r\n0\r\nspark-sql> SELECT EXTRACT(DAY FROM (cast('2020-01-15 00:00:00' as timestamp) - cast('2020-01-01 00:00:00' as timestamp)));\r\n0\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn ANSI standard, the day is exact 24 hours, so we don't need to worry about the conceptual day for interval extraction. The meaning of the conceptual day only takes effect when we add it to a zoned timestamp value.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nBoth satisfy the ANSI standard and common use cases in modern SQL platforms\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo, it new in 3.0\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nI add a new API in pyspark RDD class:\r\n\r\ndef collectWithJobGroup(self, groupId, description, interruptOnCancel=False)\r\n\r\nThis API do the same thing with `rdd.collect`, but it can specify the job group when do collect.\r\nThe purpose of adding this API is, if we use:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsc.setJobGroup(\"group-id...\")\r\nrdd.collect()\r\n```\r\nThe `setJobGroup` API in pyspark won't work correctly. This related to a bug discussed in \r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-31549\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n\r\nThis PR is a rather temporary workaround for `PYSPARK_PIN_THREAD`, and as a step to migrate to  `PYSPARK_PIN_THREAD` smoothly. It targets Spark 3.0.\r\n\r\n- `PYSPARK_PIN_THREAD` is unstable at this moment that affects whole PySpark applications.\r\n- It is impossible to make it runtime configuration as it has to be set before JVM is launched.\r\n- There is a thread leak issue between Python and JVM. We should address but it's not a release blocker for Spark 3.0 since the feature is experimental. I plan to handle this after Spark 3.0 due to stability.\r\n\r\nOnce `PYSPARK_PIN_THREAD` is enabled by default, we should remove this API out ideally. I will target to deprecate this API in Spark 3.1.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFix bug.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nA develop API in pyspark: `pyspark.RDD. collectWithJobGroup`\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit test.\r\n","created_at":"2020-04-28T13:29:20Z","updated_at":"2020-05-01T03:32:09Z","closed_at":"2020-05-01T01:08:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4c990a937386f27ea37a481c8a03837d3166a8b3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28395/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28395/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28395/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/bdd77fecc886a7b94a66c8c3dfd27f8923c22015","head":{"label":"WeichenXu123:collect_with_job_group","ref":"collect_with_job_group","sha":"bdd77fecc886a7b94a66c8c3dfd27f8923c22015","user":{"login":"WeichenXu123","id":19235986,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MjM1OTg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19235986?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123","html_url":"https://github.com/WeichenXu123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":58255485,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1ODI1NTQ4NQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"WeichenXu123/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"WeichenXu123","id":19235986,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MjM1OTg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19235986?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123","html_url":"https://github.com/WeichenXu123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/WeichenXu123/spark","description":"Mirror

test.\r\n","created_at":"2020-04-28T11:07:55Z","updated_at":"2020-05-06T04:34:49Z","closed_at":"2020-05-06T04:34:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0e389241c60a6cc40f80ba8e40a009dc9382fe8d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28393/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28393/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28393/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d185264ae4acc585855b70b2ec3caa0e63c83043","head":{"label":"adrian-wang:unescaped","ref":"unescaped","sha":"d185264ae4acc585855b70b2ec3caa0e63c83043","user":{"login":"adrian-wang","id":3078910,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzg5MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3078910?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-wang","html_url":"https://github.com/adrian-wang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-wang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-wang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-wang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-wang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-wang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-wang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-wang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-wang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-wang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18545588,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODU0NTU4OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"adrian-wang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"adrian-wang","id":3078910,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzg5MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3078910?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-wang","html_url":"https://github.com/adrian-wang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-wang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-wang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-wang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-wang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-wang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-wang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-wang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-wang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrian-wang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/adrian-wang/spark","description":"Mirror

https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/25754 introduced a bug in `isInCollection`. For example, if the SQL config `spark.sql.optimizer.inSetConversionThreshold`is set to 10 (by default):\r\n```scala\r\nval set = (0 to 20).map(_.toString).toSet\r\nval data = Seq(\"1\").toDF(\"x\")\r\ndata.select($\"x\".isInCollection(set).as(\"isInCollection\")).show()\r\n```\r\nThe function must return **'true'** because \"1\" is in the set of \"0\" ... \"20\" but it returns \"false\":\r\n```\r\n+--------------+\r\n|isInCollection|\r\n+--------------+\r\n|         false|\r\n+--------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWe are adding a new Spark Yarn configuration, `spark.yarn.populateHadoopClasspath` to not populate Hadoop classpath from `yarn.application.classpath` and `mapreduce.application.classpath`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSpark Yarn client populates extra Hadoop classpath from `yarn.application.classpath` and `mapreduce.application.classpath` when a job is submitted to a Yarn Hadoop cluster.\r\n\r\nHowever, for `with-hadoop` Spark build that embeds Hadoop runtime, it can cause jar conflicts because Spark distribution can contain different version of Hadoop jars.\r\n\r\nOne case we have is when a user uses an Apache Spark distribution with its-own embedded hadoop, and submits a job to Cloudera or Hortonworks Yarn clusters, because of two different incompatible Hadoop jars in the classpath, it runs into errors.\r\n\r\nBy not populating the Hadoop classpath from the clusters can address this issue.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAn UT is added, but very hard to add a new integration test since this requires using different incompatible versions of Hadoop.\r\n\r\nWe also manually tested this PR, and we are able to submit a Spark job using Spark distribution built with Apache Hadoop 2.10 to CDH 5.6 without populating CDH classpath.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nRepeated `sapply` avoided in internal `checkSchemaInArrow`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrent implementation is doubly inefficient:\r\n\r\n 1. Repeatedly doing the same (95%) `sapply` loop\r\n 2. Doing scalar `==` on a vector (`==` should be done over the whole vector for efficiency)\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nBy my trusty friend the CI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAfter changes in SPARK-20628, CoarseGrainedSchedulerBackend can decommission an executor and stop assigning new tasks on it. We should also decommission the corresponding blockmanagers in the same way. i.e. Move the cached RDD blocks from those executors to other active executors.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe need to gracefully decommission the block managers so that the underlying RDD cache blocks are not lost in case the executors are taken away forcefully after some timeout (because of spotloss/pre-emptible VM etc). Its good to save as much cache data as possible. \r\n\r\nAlso In future once the decommissioning signal comes from Cluster Manager (say YARN/Mesos etc), dynamic allocation + this change gives us opportunity to downscale the executors faster by making the executors free of cache data.\r\n\r\nNote that this is a best effort approach. We try to move cache blocks from decommissioning executors to active executors. If the active executors don't have free resources available on them for caching, then the decommissioning executors will keep the cache block which it was not able to move and it will still be able to serve them.\r\n\r\nCurrent overall Flow:\r\n\r\n1. CoarseGrainedSchedulerBackend receives a signal to decommissionExecutor. On receiving the signal, it do 2 things - Stop assigning new tasks (SPARK-20628), Send another message to BlockManagerMasterEndpoint (via BlockManagerMaster) to decommission the corresponding BlockManager.\r\n\r\n2. BlockManagerMasterEndpoint receives \"DecommissionBlockManagers\" message. On receiving this, it moves the corresponding block managers to \"decommissioning\" state. All decommissioning BMs are excluded from the getPeers RPC call which is used for replication. All these decommissioning BMs are also sent message from BlockManagerMasterEndpoint to start decommissioning process on themselves.\r\n\r\n3. BlockManager on worker (say BM-x) receives the \"DecommissionBlockManager\" message. Now it will start BlockManagerDecommissionManager thread to offload all the RDD cached blocks. This thread can make multiple reattempts to decommission the existing cache blocks (multiple reattempts might be needed as there might not be sufficient space in other active BMs initially).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNO\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded UTs.","created_at":"2020-04-27T13:40:33Z","updated_at":"2020-06-23T19:19:03Z","closed_at":"2020-05-18T18:38:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ea87d07a6b4bedc50cdca1dfdc31a2484f10f29d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28370/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28370/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28370/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c34305662cd91d05b5160c7de72e35e4108b6755","head":{"label":"prakharjain09:SPARK-20732-rddcache-1","ref":"SPARK-20732-rddcache-1","sha":"c34305662cd91d05b5160c7de72e35e4108b6755","user":{"login":"prakharjain09","id":2551496,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NTE0OTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2551496?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/prakharjain09","html_url":"https://github.com/prakharjain09","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prakharjain09/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prakharjain09/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prakharjain09/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prakharjain09/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prakharjain09/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prakharjain09/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prakharjain09/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prakharjain09/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prakharjain09/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":140744137,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDA3NDQxMzc=","name":"spark","full_name":"prakharjain09/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"prakharjain09","id":2551496,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NTE0OTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2551496?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/prakharjain09","html_url":"https://github.com/prakharjain09","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prakharjain09/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prakharjain09/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prakharjain09/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prakharjain09/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prakharjain09/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prakharjain09/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prakharjain09/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prakharjain09/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prakharjain09/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/prakharjain09/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWith https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28310, the operation of date +/- interval(m, d, 0) has been improved a lot.\r\n\r\nAccording to the benchmark results, about 75% time cost is reduced because of no casting date to timestamp back and forth.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we add a benchmark for these operations, and timestamp +/- interval operations as accessories.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nPerformance test coverage, since these operations are missing in the DateTimeBenchmark.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, just test\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFor regex functions in base R (`gsub`, `grep`, `grepl`, `strsplit`, `gregexpr`), supplying the `fixed=TRUE` option will be more performant. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis is a minor fix for performance\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo (although some internal code was applying fixed-as-regex in some cases that could technically have been over-broad and caught unintended patterns)\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to replace `NESTED_PREDICATE_PUSHDOWN_ENABLED` with `NESTED_PREDICATE_PUSHDOWN_V1_SOURCE_LIST` which can configure which v1 data sources are enabled with nested predicate pushdown.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWe added nested predicate pushdown feature that is configured by `NESTED_PREDICATE_PUSHDOWN_ENABLED`. However, this config is all or nothing config, and applies on all data sources.\r\n\r\nIn order to not introduce API breaking change after enabling nested predicate pushdown, we'd like to set nested predicate pushdown per data sources. Please also refer to the comments https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/27728#discussion_r410829720.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded/Modified unit

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nInternal usages like `{stop,warning,message}({paste,paste0,sprintf}` and `{stop,warning,message}(some_literal_string_as_variable` have been removed and replaced as appropriate.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCRAN policy recommends against using such constructions to build error messages, in particular because it makes the process of creating portable error messages for the package more onerous.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThere may be some small grammatical changes visible in error messaging.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNot

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nRemove all the extra whitespaces in the formatted explain.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe number of extra whitespaces of the formatted explain becomes different between master and branch-3.0. This causes a problem that whenever we backport formatted explain related tests from master to branch-3.0, it will fail branch-3.0. Besides, extra whitespaces are always disallowed in Spark. Thus, we should remove them as possible as we can.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo, formatted explain is newly added in Spark 3.0.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUpdated sql query

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to provide a new option to specify time-to-live (TTL) for output file entries in FileStreamSink. TTL is defined via current timestamp - the last modified time for the file.\r\n\r\nThis patch will filter out outdated output files in metadata while compacting batches (other batches don't have functionality to clean entries), which helps metadata to not grow linearly, as well as filtered out files will be \"eventually\" no longer seen in reader queries which leverage File(Stream)Source.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe metadata log greatly helps to easily achieve exactly-once but given the output path is open to arbitrary readers, there's no way to compact the metadata log, which ends up growing the metadata file as query runs for long time, especially for compacted batch.\r\n\r\nLots of end users have been reporting the issue: see comments in [SPARK-24295](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-24295) and [SPARK-29995](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-29995), and [SPARK-30462](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-30462).\r\n(There're some reports from end users which include their workarounds: SPARK-24295)\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, as the configuration is new and by default it is not applied.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew UT.","created_at":"2020-04-27T07:37:32Z","updated_at":"2020-12-01T05:43:43Z","closed_at":"2020-12-01T05:43:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c40657804597b6b460dd79e82b4fd1174dfa9c98","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR backports #28317 which escapes text for tooltip for DAG Viz and Timeline View.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis is a bug.\r\nNormally, DAG Viz and Timeline View show tooltip like as follows.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"278\" alt=\"dag-viz-tooltip\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4736016/80127481-5a6c6880-85cf-11ea-8daf-cfd59aa3ba09.png\">\r\n<img width=\"477\" alt=\"timeline-tooltip\"

which should be escaped for HTML without escaping , the corresponding tooltips wouldn't show the callsite and its following text properly.\r\n<img width=\"179\" alt=\"dag-viz-tooltip-before-fixed\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4736016/80128480-b1267200-85d0-11ea-8035-ad68ae5fbcab.png\">\r\n<img width=\"261\" alt=\"timeline-tooltip-before-fixed\"

escaped.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI tested manually.\r\nFirst, I ran a job `sc.parallelize(1 to 10).collect` in Spark Shell then, visited AllJobsPage and JobPage and confirmed tooltip texts.\r\n<img width=\"277\" alt=\"timeline-tooltip-fixed-3 0\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4736016/80332616-41411180-8886-11ea-8d93-28e1c5265115.png\">\r\n<img width=\"191\" alt=\"dag-tooltip-fixed-3 0\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4736016/80332625-44d49880-8886-11ea-8f2e-de8df1369e62.png\">\r\nAnd I confirmed that the appearance of the label of DAG-viz in StagePage is not changed. \r\n<img width=\"313\" alt=\"stage-page-dag\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4736016/80332725-9b41d700-8886-11ea-9adb-40d50ad29f86.png\">\r\n\r\nI also added a testcase.\r\nWith this testcase, an error message related to JavaScript is shown.\r\n\r\n`TypeError: Cannot call method \"indexOf\" of undefined (http://192.168.1.209:59376/static/spark-dag-viz.js#378)`\r\n\r\nThis is thrown from `interpretLineBreak` in `spark-dag-viz.js`.\r\nHtmlUnit seems not to support `innerHTML` for text content (I tried replacing it with `textContent` and the error message is not shown).\r\nBut DOMs which is needed by the testcase added is already rendered before `interpretLineBreak` is called. So the testcase successfully passes.","created_at":"2020-04-27T04:07:42Z","updated_at":"2021-06-04T20:44:20Z","closed_at":"2020-04-28T15:58:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b006696f4e1b1ccd561d1a2553c5c6f0088f6525","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605079,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDc5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/WEB%20UI","name":"WEB

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nUse `TaskSetManger.abort` to abort a barrier stage instead of throwing exception within `resourceOffers`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nAny non fatal exception thrown within Spark RPC framework can be swallowed:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/100fc58da54e026cda87832a10e2d06eaeccdf87/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/rpc/netty/Inbox.scala#L202-L211\r\n\r\n The method `TaskSchedulerImpl.resourceOffers` is also within the scope of Spark RPC framework. Thus, throw exception inside `resourceOffers` won't fail the application.\r\n\r\n As a result, if a barrier stage fail the require check at `require(addressesWithDescs.size == taskSet.numTasks, ...)`, the barrier stage will fail the check again and again util all tasks from `TaskSetManager` dequeued.   But since the barrier stage isn't really executed, the application will hang.\r\n\r\nThe issue can be reproduced by the following test:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\ninitLocalClusterSparkContext(2)\r\nval rdd0 = sc.parallelize(Seq(0, 1, 2, 3), 2)\r\nval dep = new OneToOneDependency[Int](rdd0)\r\nval rdd = new MyRDD(sc, 2, List(dep), Seq(Seq(\"executor_h_0\"),Seq(\"executor_h_0\")))\r\nrdd.barrier().mapPartitions { iter =>\r\n  BarrierTaskContext.get().barrier()\r\n  iter\r\n}.collect()\r\n```\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, application hang previously but fail-fast after this fix.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded a regression test.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2020-04-27T02:37:23Z","updated_at":"2020-04-27T06:53:14Z","closed_at":"2020-04-27T06:10:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"613df91761ca0c9c1e7b846a968ffda649a3a8bd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28357/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28357/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28357/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/532a51d307938da156c956a0e073c546312c5281","head":{"label":"Ngone51:bp-spark-31485-24","ref":"bp-spark-31485-24","sha":"532a51d307938da156c956a0e073c546312c5281","user":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":114185286,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTQxODUyODY=","name":"spark","full_name":"Ngone51/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51/spark","description":"Mirror

swallowed:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/100fc58da54e026cda87832a10e2d06eaeccdf87/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/rpc/netty/Inbox.scala#L202-L211\r\n\r\n The method `TaskSchedulerImpl.resourceOffers` is also within the scope of Spark RPC framework. Thus, throw exception inside `resourceOffers` won't fail the application.\r\n\r\n As a result, if a barrier stage fail the require check at `require(addressesWithDescs.size == taskSet.numTasks, ...)`, the barrier stage will fail the check again and again util all tasks from `TaskSetManager` dequeued.   But since the barrier stage isn't really executed, the application will hang.\r\n\r\nThe issue can be reproduced by the following test:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\ninitLocalClusterSparkContext(2)\r\nval rdd0 = sc.parallelize(Seq(0, 1, 2, 3), 2)\r\nval dep = new OneToOneDependency[Int](rdd0)\r\nval rdd = new MyRDD(sc, 2, List(dep), Seq(Seq(\"executor_h_0\"),Seq(\"executor_h_0\")))\r\nrdd.barrier().mapPartitions { iter =>\r\n  BarrierTaskContext.get().barrier()\r\n  iter\r\n}.collect()\r\n```\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, application hang previously but fail-fast after this fix.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded a regression test.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2020-04-27T02:34:51Z","updated_at":"2020-04-27T12:06:21Z","closed_at":"2020-04-27T12:06:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cb72c93fa3c21da8689256895d0f78b38ec53e78","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28356/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28356/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28356/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0f9a18655b53630ad4690ce03a066f76f23f5812","head":{"label":"Ngone51:bp-spark-31485","ref":"bp-spark-31485","sha":"0f9a18655b53630ad4690ce03a066f76f23f5812","user":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":114185286,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTQxODUyODY=","name":"spark","full_name":"Ngone51/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe collect_set() aggregate function should produce a set of distinct elements. When the column argument's type is BinayType this is not the case.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```scala\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.functions._\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.expressions.Window\r\n\r\ncase class R(id: String, value: String, bytes: Array[Byte])\r\ndef makeR(id: String, value: String) = R(id, value, value.getBytes)\r\nval df = Seq(makeR(\"a\", \"dog\"), makeR(\"a\", \"cat\"), makeR(\"a\", \"cat\"), makeR(\"b\", \"fish\")).toDF()\r\n// In the example below \"bytesSet\" erroneously has duplicates but \"stringSet\" does not (as expected).\r\ndf.agg(collect_set('value) as \"stringSet\", collect_set('bytes) as \"byteSet\").show(truncate=false)\r\n// The same problem is displayed when using window functions.\r\nval win = Window.partitionBy('id).rowsBetween(Window.unboundedPreceding, Window.unboundedFollowing)\r\nval result = df.select(\r\n  collect_set('value).over(win) as \"stringSet\",\r\n  collect_set('bytes).over(win) as \"bytesSet\"\r\n)\r\n.select('stringSet, 'bytesSet, size('stringSet) as \"stringSetSize\", size('bytesSet) as \"bytesSetSize\")\r\n.show()\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe use a HashSet buffer to accumulate the results, the problem is that arrays equality in Scala don't behave as expected, arrays ara just plain java arrays and the equality don't compare the content of the arrays\r\nArray(1, 2, 3) == Array(1, 2, 3)  => False\r\nThe result is that duplicates are not removed in the hashset\r\n\r\nThe solution proposed is that in the last stage, when we have all the data in the Hashset buffer, we delete duplicates changing the type of the elements and then transform it to the original type.\r\nThis transformation is only applied when we have a BinaryType\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFix the bug explained\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nImprove documentation for `gapply` in `SparkR`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nSpent a long time this weekend trying to figure out just what exactly `key` is in `gapply`'s `func`. I had assumed it would be a _named_ list, but apparently not -- the examples are working because `schema` is applying the name and the names of the output `data.frame` don't matter.\r\n\r\nAs near as I can tell the description I've added is correct, namely, that `key` is an unnamed list.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo? Not in code. Only documentation.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNot.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1, add new param `blockSize`;\r\n2, add a new class InstanceBlock;\r\n3, **if `blockSize==1`, keep original behavior; if `blockSize>1`, stack input vectors to blocks (like ALS/MLP);**\r\n4, if `blockSize>1`, standardize the input outside of optimization procedure;\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1, reduce RAM to persist traing dataset; (save about 40% RAM)\r\n2, use Level-2 BLAS routines; (4x ~ 5x faster on dataset `epsilon`)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, a new param is

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR modifies LegacyDateFormatter#parse to return proleptic Gregorian days rather than hybrid Julian days.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe legacy time parser currently returns epoch days in the hybrid Julian calendar. However, the callers to the legacy parser (e.g., UnivocityParser, JacksonParser) expect epoch days in the proleptic Gregorian calendar. As a result, pre-Gregorian dates like '1000-01-01' get interpreted as '1000-01-06'.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual testing and modified existing unit
