This feature is fully described in issue #7654.\r\n\r\nFixes: #7654\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [x] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests were added to validate the functionality of the implemented methods. Besides this, the overall functionality was tested in a local lab with two secondary storage available, creating basic JS rules and validating that the resource was allocated according to the heuristic rule. Below, there are some examples used in the tests, based on the variables available for each resource type specified in the specification of the feature proposal.\r\n\r\n1. Allocate a resource type to a specific secondary storage.\r\n```js\r\nfunction findStorageWithSpecificId(pool) {\r\n\treturn pool.id === '7432f961-c602-4e8e-8580-2496ffbbc45d';\r\n}\r\n\r\nsecondaryStorages.filter(findStorageWithSpecificId)[0].id\r\n```\r\n2. Dedicate storage pools for a type of template format.\r\n```js\r\nfunction directToDedicatedQCOW2Pool(pool) {\r\n  return pool.id === '7432f961-c602-4e8e-8580-2496ffbbc45d';\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction directToDedicatedVHDPool(pool) {\r\n  return pool.id === '1ea0109a-299d-4e37-8460-3e9823f9f25c';\r\n}\r\n\r\nif (template.format === 'QCOW2') {\r\n  secondaryStorages.filter(directToDedicatedQCOW2Pool)[0].id\r\n} else if (template.format === 'VHD') {\r\n  secondaryStorages.filter(directToDedicatedVHDPool)[0].id\r\n}\r\n```\r\n3. Direct snapshot of volumes with the KVM hypervisor to a specific secondary storage.\r\n```js\r\nif (snapshot.hypervisorType === 'KVM') {\r\n  '7432f961-c602-4e8e-8580-2496ffbbc45d';\r\n}\r\n```\r\n4. Direct resources to a specific domain:\r\n```js\r\nif (account.domain.id == '52d83793-26de-11ec-8dcf-5254005dcdac') {\r\n  '1ea0109a-299d-4e37-8460-3e9823f9f25c'\r\n} else if (account.domain.id == 'c1186146-5ceb-4901-94a1-dd1d24bd849d') {\r\n  '7432f961-c602-4e8e-8580-2496ffbbc45d'\r\n}\r\n```","created_at":"2023-06-20T19:33:26Z","updated_at":"2024-08-27T10:45:02Z","closed_at":"2023-12-04T08:52:33Z","merged_at":"2023-12-04T08:52:33Z","merge_commit_sha":"b0910fc61d7b98bdfd3700f5641f3c84b2ec63bc","assignee":{"login":"rajujith","id":5229147,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMjkxNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5229147?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajujith","html_url":"https://github.com/rajujith","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajujith/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajujith/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajujith/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajujith/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajujith/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajujith/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajujith/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajujith/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajujith/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"rajujith","id":5229147,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMjkxNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5229147?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajujith","html_url":"https://github.com/rajujith","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajujith/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajujith/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajujith/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajujith/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajujith/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajujith/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajujith/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajujith/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajujith/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"rohityadavcloud","id":95203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud","html_url":"https://github.com/rohityadavcloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"andrijapanicsb","id":45762285,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NzYyMjg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45762285?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrijapanicsb","html_url":"https://github.com/andrijapanicsb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrijapanicsb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrijapanicsb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrijapanicsb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrijapanicsb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrijapanicsb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrijapanicsb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrijapanicsb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrijapanicsb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrijapanicsb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"shwstppr","id":153340,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzM0MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/153340?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr","html_url":"https://github.com/shwstppr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"htt

It concatenates the template and VM user data as a multipart MIME message\r\n\r\nSupported data formats: https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/explanation/format.html#user-data-formats\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n- Add user data for different types (cloud-config, bash scripts)\r\n- Register a template and link userdata with APPEND policy\r\n- Deploy VM from the template and link another existing userdata\r\n- Verify the generated user data is a multipart MIME message","created_at":"2023-06-16T17:07:57Z","updated_at":"2023-07-12T08:27:21Z","closed_at":"2023-07-10T07:47:04Z","merged_at":"2023-07-10T07:47:03Z","merge_commit_sha":"b1fc2798726bd5ca0782bce59749e8ee30399916","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"borisstoyanov","id":13551960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTUxOTYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13551960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov","html_url":"https://github.com/borisstoyanov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borisstoyanov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"weizhouapache","id":57355700,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MzU1NzAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57355700?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache","html_url":"https://github.com/weizhouapache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":37843366,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzNzg0MzM2Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/type:enhancement","name":"type:enhancement","color":"84b6eb","default":false,"description":""},{"id":584073853,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODQwNzM4NTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:api","name":"component:api","color":"1DB401","default":false,"description":""},{"id":904051781,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5MDQwNTE3ODE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/Python","name":"Python","color":"a9b50e","default":false,"description":"Warning...

Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, ACS can continue to show an imported instance/VM as an unmanaged instance if the name and internalCSName (custom attribute, cloud.vm.internal.name) is different for the instance/VM on vCenter. This PR while filtering managed instances from the instance list received from ESXi host also checks if the internal name for the instance is not in the managed instance names list.\r\n\r\n### Types

<code>Files.createTempDir</code> and <code>FileBackedOutputStream</code> to further address CVE-2020-8908 (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/guava/issues/4011\">#4011</a>) and CVE-2023-2976 (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/guava/issues/2575\">#2575</a>). (feb83a1c8f)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While CVE-2020-8908 was officially closed when we deprecated <code>Files.createTempDir</code> in <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/releases/tag/v30.0\">Guava 30.0</a>, we've heard from users that even recent versions of Guava have been listed as vulnerable in <em>other</em> databases of security vulnerabilities. In response, we've reimplemented the method (and the very rarely used <code>FileBackedOutputStream</code> class, which had a similar issue) to eliminate the insecure behavior entirely. This change could technically affect users in a number of different ways (discussed under &quot;Incompatible changes&quot; below), but in practice, the only problem users are likely to encounter is with Windows. If you are using those APIs under Windows, you should skip 32.0.0 and go straight to <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/releases/tag/v32.0.1\">32.0.1</a> which fixes the problem. (Unfortunately, we didn't think of the Windows problem until after the release. And while we <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava#important-warnings\">warn that <code>common.io</code> in particular may not work under Windows</a>, we didn't intend to regress support.) Sorry for the trouble.</p>\n<h4>Incompatible changes</h4>\n<p>Although this release bumps Guava's major version number, it makes <strong>no binary-incompatible changes to the <code>guava</code> artifact</strong>.</p>\n<p>One change could cause issues for Widows users, and a few other changes could cause issues for users in more usual situations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The new implementations of <code>Files.createTempDir</code> and <code>FileBackedOutputStream</code> <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/guava/issues/6535\">throw an exception under Windows</a>.</strong> This is fixed in <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/releases/tag/v32.0.1\">32.0.1</a>. Sorry for the trouble.</li>\n<li>This release makes a binary-incompatible change to a <code>@Beta</code> API in the <strong>separate artifact</strong> <code>guava-testlib</code>. Specifically, we changed the return type of <code>TestingExecutors.sameThreadScheduledExecutor</code> to <code>ListeningScheduledExecutorService</code>. The old return type was a package-private class, which caused the Kotlin compiler to produce warnings. (dafaa3e435)</li>\n<li>This release <em>adds</em> two methods to the Android flavor of Guava: <code>Invokable.getAnnotatedReturnType()</code> and <code>Parameter.getAnnotatedType()</code>. Those methods do not work under an Android VM; we added them only to help our tests of the Android flavor (since we also run those tests under a JRE). Android VMs tolerate such methods as long as the app does not call them or perform reflection on them, and builds tolerate them because of our new Proguard configurations (discussed below). Thus, we expect no impact to most users. However, we could imagine build problems for users who have set up their own build system for the Android flavor of Guava. Please report any problems so that we can judge how safely we might be able to add other methods to the Android flavor in the future, such as APIs that use Java 8 classes like <code>Stream</code>.

Description\r\n\r\nThe user's dashboard presents the user's amount of running VMs, stopped VMs, total VMs, volumes, networks, and public IP addresses. The APIs `listVirtualMachines`, `listVolumes`, `listNetworks`, and `listPublicIpAddresses` process and return the whole data, which can be slow when dealing with a great number of resources. However, for the user's dashboard context, we just need the count of resources.\r\n\r\nThis PR intends to create a new parameter (`retrieveonlyresourcecount`) in those APIs to skip the data processing and return only the resource count.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nI created several VMs in my environment, logged in with a domain admin, and observed how much time the dashboard was taking to completely load. Before the changes, it was taking more than 30 seconds to load and the time would increase according to the amount of resources:\r\n\r\n![before](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/assets/38945620/5b58b8b3-405c-417c-9bc8-ad01bd7144f0)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/assets/38945620/ba834c3f-bdc9-4fd2-8234-53ecdc27a04e)\r\n\r\n\r\nWith

Description\r\n\r\nIf you try to migrate a VM with volume and its template was removed, it results in a NullPointerException and the migration doesn't occur. \r\n\r\nIf the template is already in both pools, the NPE happens in `getVolumeBackingFile`, when `_vmTemplateDao.findById()` returns null and it then tries to call from it. The fix was to check if it is null (and since it can only be null if it was removed, since `srcVolumeInfo` has `templateId`) and return null so it does a FullClone Migration.\r\n\r\nIf the template is not in both pools, the NPE happens in `copyTemplateToTargetFilesystemStorageIfNeeded`, when `TemplateObjectTO` tries to `getInstallPath()` on a null object. The fix was the same, check if `findById()` returns null and, if so, don't copy it.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [X] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n- Uploaded two templates (A and B) to ACS, created one VM for each.

Description\r\n\r\n    This feature allows the storage migration for ScaleIO volumes between the ScaleIO storage pools of the same and different ScaleIO storage clusters. Previously this operation was blocked and now we are allowing it from API/UI.\r\n    \r\n    The volume migration within the same storage cluster is performed using ScaleIO’s native V-Tree migration operation where the volume will be live migrated to another storage pool. The volume migration across the different storage cluster is performed using libvirt’s live blockcopy operation which will first copy the volume to the destination storage pool and after a successful copy, the source volume will be deleted.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a feature in UI to notify when:\r\n* a new version of CloudStack is available (only for admins)\r\n* Custom alert message set in config.json\r\n\r\nOn login, if there are any networks or VPCs which need restart, insert a message in the notification panel.\r\n\r\nThis PR also adds a small UI improvement in the UI to show which network/UI requires restart and filtering networks/VPCs which require restart.\r\n\r\nP.S. - As of now, after upgrading ACS `restart required` is not set to `true` for network or VPC even if the router needs an upgrade.\r\n\r\n<!---

message (configured in config.json)\r\nThis is useful if the operator wants to display a custom message to the users. The operator needs to set the message by setting the value of `alertMessage` in the `config.json`. Type of message can be configured by `alertMessageType` in `config.json`. Possible values are `success`, `info`, `warning` and `error`.\r\n<details><summary>Details</summary>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b8bc724-056e-4340-bfd9-bb80a3c3c75a)\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n</details> \r\n\r\n#### New

Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, in the Quota emails, the formatting of monetary values does not include the currency symbol defined in the `quota.currency.symbol` configuration. Additionally, the values are not formatted.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the Quota emails to use the quota.currency.symbol configuration to set the currency symbol. Additionally, a new configuration has also been created, `quota.currency.locale`, which should be set to format the value's punctuation in the quota emails using the wanted locale, en-US or pt-BR for example.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the following:\r\n- When destroying a local storage pool during host force deletion: then also destroy the volumes on the pool from DB\r\n- When expunging a destroyed volume: check if the volume's storage pool exists (not removed). In case its removed, skip the volume removal from storage\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ]

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR upgrades the mockito version and removes powermockito from `utils` module.\r\n\r\nMoving to Mockito to mock static methods (available since 3.4.0) instead of powermockito

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR removes the dependency on the deprecated method SmartConnectNoSSL from the pyVim.connect module. The pyVmomi library removed this method in newer versions, leading to errors when trying to import it.\r\n\r\nInstead of using SmartConnectNoSSL, I have modified the code to use SmartConnect with a custom SSL context when SSL verification is disabled. Python has an inbuilt method to create an SSL context that does not verify the authenticity of the SSL certificate, ssl._create_unverified_context(). This method is used to create a context which is passed to SmartConnect.\r\n\r\nThe following changes were made to the code:\r\n\r\nImport of ssl added at the top of the file.\r\nSmartConnectNoSSL was removed from the imports from the pyVim.connect module. Modified the block of code where SmartConnect or SmartConnectNoSSL was used to create a service instance. It now creates an unverified SSL context if the disable_ssl_verification option is set and Python supports creating unverified SSL contexts. This context is then passed to SmartConnect. This PR helps to maintain compatibility with newer versions of pyVmomi and avoids using deprecated methods.\r\n\r\nFinally, it should be noted that disabling SSL verification can lead to potential security issues.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a simple `EditorConfig` file. I used only three settings to start with.  \r\n\r\nLots of great projects already use EditorConfig:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig/wiki/Projects-Using-EditorConfig\r\n\r\nAnd you can see how Apache Airflow does it:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/.editorconfig\r\n\r\nFrom the official site:\r\n\r\n\"EditorConfig helps maintain consistent coding styles for multiple developers working on the same project across various editors and IDEs. The EditorConfig project consists of a file format for defining coding styles and a collection of text editor plugins that enable editors to read the file format and adhere to defined styles. EditorConfig files are easily readable and they work nicely with version control systems.\"\r\n\r\nhttps://editorconfig.org/\r\n\r\nA lot of editors already come bundled with support: https://editorconfig.org/#pre-installed\r\n\r\nSome editors require you to download a plugin: https://editorconfig.org/#download\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour

Description\r\n\r\nThere are tools like cluster-api which create and manage kubernetes cluster on CloudStack. This PR adds the option to add *unmanaged* kubernetes cluster which are not managed by CKS plugin. This helps provide a consolidated view of unmanaged clusters on CloudStack. The changes done make sure that operations for managed clusters are not executed for unmanaged clusters.\r\n\r\nTwo new APIs have also been added:\r\n1. `addVirtualMachinesToKubernetesCluster` - to add VMs to unmanaged clusters.\r\n2.  `removeVirtualMachinesFromKubernetesCluster` - to remove VMs to unmanaged clusters.\r\n\r\nTwo APIs have been updated:\r\n1. `createKubernetesCluster` - made `KUBERNETES_VERSION_ID`, `SERVICE_OFFERING_ID`, `SIZE` as not required for unmanaged clusters. Add an additional parameter, `managed`, which is true by default.\r\n2. `listKubernetesClusters` - Add a parameter `managed` to filter on `managed` field.\r\n3. \r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n\r\n<!--- ********************************************************************************* -->\r\n<!--- NOTE: AUTOMATATION USES THE DESCRIPTIONS TO SET LABELS AND PRODUCE DOCUMENTATION. -->\r\n<!--- PLEASE PUT AN 'X' in only **ONE** box -->\r\n<!--- ********************************************************************************* -->\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n<!-- Please describe in detail how you tested your changes. -->\r\n<!-- Include details of your testing environment, and the tests you ran to -->\r\n<!-- see how your change affects other areas of the code, etc. -->\r\nTest locally by creating a kubernetes cluster using https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api-provider-cloudstack.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) document -->\r\n","created_at":"2023-05-11T06:57:51Z","updated_at":"2023-07-03T07:37:37Z","closed_at":"2023-07-03T07:37:33Z","merged_at":"2023-07-03T07:37:33Z","merge_commit_sha":"2fcbe6241f23cf44a80ffe6a423e5e9744c899e4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"shwstppr","id":153340,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzM0MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/153340?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr","html_url":"https://github.com/shwstppr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":584073278,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODQwNzMyNzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:primary-storage","name":"component:primary-storage","color":"5319e7","default":false,"description":""},{"id":584073853,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODQwNzM4NTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:api","name":"component:api","color":"1DB401","default":false,"description":""},{"id":739374767,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MzkzNzQ3Njc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:UI","name":"component:UI","color":"ea62a8","default":false,"description":""},{"id":904051781,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5MDQwNTE3ODE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/Python","name":"Python","color":"a9b50e","default":false,"description":"Warning...

Description\r\n\r\nIn troubleshooting ops issues we see logs like:\r\n\r\nMaximum domain resource limits of Type 'user_vm' for Domain Id = 763 is exceeded: Domain Resource Limit = (1 bytes) 1, Current Domain Resource Amount = (0 bytes) 0, Requested Resource Amount = (1 bytes) 1.\"\r\n\r\nHowever there is one missing value (currentResourceReservation) that is used in the calculation of limit check but it is not logged, which leads to confusion. Above we see we are using “0” and requested 1, with our limit being 1, but was rejected. Without logging all the values used in the calculation we don’t understand why it failed.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if we had this log above it would be clearer that a second bug is occurring. When we query for domain level resource reservations in “getDomainReservation” the actual SearchBuilder is the listAccountAndTypeSearch, not the listDomainAndTypeSearch. As a result, when we call getDomainReservation the query returns any outstanding domain reservation for any account, as domain ID is not a valid filter for the account search.\r\n\r\nThis PR:\r\n\r\n- Increases detailed information in log for checking resource limit to include reservations information for functions: checkDomainResourceLimit() and checkAccountResourceLimit\r\n\r\n- Fixes getDomainReservation() to use listDomainAndTypeSearch instead of listAccountAndTypeSearch\r\n\r\n#### Testing\r\nLog generation manually tested\r\n\r\n#### Log samples\r\n\r\nBefore the change\r\n\r\n(logprefix) ...

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes a null pointer edge case where a PowerFlex volume is attached to a VM.\r\n\r\nIn this edge case, a VM has been created, started, stopped, and then reimaged. VM has a last host ID but the newly attached volume does not yet have a storage pool assigned, it will be assigned on the VM start.  However, we assume that if the VM's host is not null, we need to try to revoke access to the volume for the host. Since there is no storage pool yet for the volume, we hit a null pointer when checking to see if the volume's pool is PowerFlex.\r\n\r\nThis was affecting all storage types, I could reproduce it with local storage, since the null pointer is at the check for pool's type.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nVerified but was reproducible with a local storage dev environment.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adjusts the DirectDownload certificate check initial delay. Since the time unit is in hours, I think it was a mistake to schedule the initial check to be in 60 hours after management servers start - the intention was likely 60 seconds.  We had turned this feature on to run hourly, not realizing we would have to wait 2.5 days to see it first run!\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an

Description\r\n\r\nCurrently when setting tags for a resource, a host for example, offerings with those tags will be directed towards that resource. However, offerings without any tags may also be directed towards it. Making it so even after tagging a resource, with the intention of making it exclusive to certain types of offerings, this exclusiveness might be ignored.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the current tag system only allows the user to inform a simple list of tags, without the possibility to create more complex rules, like checking if the offering has certain pairs of tags.\r\n\r\nTo address the described problems, we propose to create a new feature to allow users to use JS to create more complex tagging rules in the following APIs:\r\n- updateHost\r\n- createStoragePool\r\n- updateStoragePool\r\n\r\nFor this, we will use the JS interpreter introduced in #5909. We will introduce a new preset variable, called \"tags\", which can be used to refer to the offering's tags list that will be paired with the resource. A simple example of a rule using this preset variable is:\r\n`tags[0] == cereal && tags[1] == milk`\r\n\r\nWhen setting a resource with this tag rule, only offerings whose first tag is cereal and second tag is milk will be accepted, offerings without tags will not be accepted. Although, this simple rule does not care for the rest of the offering's tags, so an offering with a third tag will also be accepted, no matter what the tag is.\r\n\r\nTo allow users to keep using the current tagging system without any hassle, we propose to introduce a new parameter to the affected APIs to inform if ACS should treat them the classic way, or to try to interpret it a rule in JS.\r\n\r\nIn order to support this behavior, we need to store which way the tags should be interpreted by ACS. We propose to add a new column called `is_tag_a_rule` in the following tables:\r\n- host_tags\r\n- storage_pool_tags\r\n\r\nFurthermore, those same tables will have their tag column type changed from `varchar(255)` to `text`, to allow rules that have more than 255 characters.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [X] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [X] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nUnit tests were created, and some were updated.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR checks that the NodeList returned from grabbing \"source\" element on a network interface actually returns items before trying to use the first element.\r\n\r\nNot all network interface XML has a \"source\" field, so this would break qemu hooks from processing in some cases. The index out of bounds exception is silently swallowed, because I guess we don't want this to be fatal.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nRan a few different types of VM XML through the script via:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncat vm.xml | /etc/libvirt/hooks/qemu vm-name migrate begin -\r\n```\r\n\r\nPreviously no output would be returned, with patch we get VM XML. Not sure if there is an existing test framework for these scripts to add some example XML to run through it at packaging/build time.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR slows down the console paste text function in the console ever so slightly, adding 25ms between each character. It was found that when large text is pasted, say an SSH key or something over 100 characters, it would stop somewhere in the 100-200 character range, and if the last character was capitalized it would be stuck with left shift held down. \r\n\r\nIn debugging, I ran noVNC locally with websockify against a Qemu VNC and took the whole console proxy out of the equation and was still able to reproduce it. I traced the websocket packets and we were clearly firing off all of the keypresses just fine, but the ones on the end were getting dropped VNC server side. It seems we are overloading a keyboard buffer, or something along those lines when we send all of the keypress messages at once. It was also observed that we were able to send off all of the messages via websocket in just a few ms but the typing on the guest side took a few seconds, so there is some buffering and processing going on and I think we are just hitting some limit in this.\r\n\r\nThis `sendText` function doesn't seem to exist in upstream noVNC, so just patching it here seems reasonable. I suspect we added this for feature parity with whatever noVNC replaced.\r\n\r\nIn testing it is now much more reliable in sending a few paragraphs of text, and not visibly slower than before, but obviously still too slow to do anything really big with it. It isn't really the goal to be able to paste full documents.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ]

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes live local storage migration for VMs created with \"Direct Download\" images. \r\n\r\nCurrently, the local storage driver has no special handling for direct download templates during live storage migration. The workflow is something like 1) check to see if root volume's backing template exists on destination primary storage 2) if not, then send a CopyCommand to copy template to destination storage 3) create new destination volume on destination primary storage against the backing template. 4) send destination volume info during MigrateCommand so we can rewrite the volume path in the VM XML during migration 5) migrate VM.  In step 2 - CopyCommand is not the right thing to do for putting a \"Direct Download\" template onto primary storage, it should instead be a type of DirectDownloadCommand.  \r\n\r\nAdditionally, Direct Downloads don't use the template ID as the name of the template file on primary, they use a dynamically generated name, so the template paths are different between source and destination pools. Thus we need to pass the new template path along in MigrateCommand so we can replace this backing store path in the VM XML during live migration.\r\n\r\nThis patch updates the KvmNonManagedStorageDataMotionStrategy used during local storage migration to handle staging of DirectDownload templates via a DirectDownloadCommand instead of a CopyCommand, and also provides the backing store path and relevant XML substitution during MigrateCommand handling.\r\n\r\nAdditional testing would be appreciated for workflows involving the KVMNonManagedStorageDataMotionStrategy, though I suspect the scope is fairly limited to live storage migration of Filesystem and NFS storage types. Since this class extends the StorageSystemDataMotionStrategy, some minor changes were made to it as well but nothing that should change its behavior.\r\n\r\nI haven't tested migration of Direct Download VMs while stopped yet, that may need a separate/similar PR.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [

Description\r\n\r\nSometimes users have the need to move resources between domains, for example, in a big company, a department may be moved from one part of the company to another, changing the company's department hierarchy, the easiest way of reflecting this change on the company's cloud environment would be to move subdomains between domains, but currently ACS offers no option to do that. \r\nThis PR adds the `moveDomain` API,  which will move domains between subdomains. Furthermore, if the domain that is being moved has any subdomains, those will also be moved, maintaining the current subdomain tree.\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [X] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [x] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n## Description of tests\r\n\r\n| Test | Result |\r\n| ------ | ------ |\r\n| Move an Inactive Domain | Error, as an inactive domain should not be able to be moved |\r\n| Move a Domain to a new inactive parent domain | Error, as a domain that  is inactive should not receive any new children|\r\n| Move a domain to a new parent domain that has a child with the same name as the domain to be moved | Error, as two subdomains of the same domain should not have the same name |\r\n| Move Domain ROOT | Error, root domain by definition must always be the father of all other domains|\r\n| Move a domain that is already on the destination | Error, as it is already is were it should be |\r\n| Move a domain to itself (moved domain = new parent domain) | Error, as this makes no sense |\r\n| Move a domain that uses a shared network that is inaccessible to the new parent domain | Error, as the new parent domain must have access to all of its children's resources |\r\n| Move a domain that has a child subdomain that uses a shared network that is inaccessible to the new parent domain | Error, as the new parent domain must have access to all of its children's resources |\r\n| Move a domain that uses a affinity group that is inaccessible to the new parent domain | Error, as the new parent domain must have access to all of its children's resources |\r\n| Move a domain that has a child subdomain that uses a affinity group that is inaccessible to the new parent domain | Error,  as the new parent domain must have access to all of its children's resources|\r\n| Move a domain that owns a shared network | Success |\r\n| Move a domain that has a subdomain that owns a shared network | Success |\r\n| Move a domain that uses a shared network that is accessible to the new parent domain | Success |\r\n| Move a domain that has a subdomain that uses a shared network that is accessible to the new parent domain | Success |\r\n| Move a domain that owns an affinity group | Success |\r\n| Move a domain that has a subdomain that owns an affinity group | Success |\r\n| Move a domain that uses a affinity group that is accessible to the new parent domain | Success |\r\n| Move a domain that has a subdomain that uses a affinity group that is accessible to the new parent domain | Success |\r\n| Move a domain that exceeds the resource limits of the new parent domain | Success |\r\n\r\n\r\nAll tests performed as expected. In the case of shared networks, all had subdomain access.\r\n\r\nFor successful cases, it was checked whether the following attributes of the moved domain and its children were correctly changed:\r\n-
