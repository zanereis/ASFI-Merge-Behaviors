Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow 1735](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1735) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nThe majority of the details are in the JIRA so I'll be brief here. If I run a task through the UI that was unscheduled the logs for the task don't show up even if it has run and the UI has reflected that it has run. It is missing the time component 00:00:00 and so one way to get that fixed is with this change I have in the PR. We can just get the dttm from the execution_date passed in the args (url) and then set the execution_date to be the isoformat of the dttm datetime object. This has worked out and fixed this issue for us. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nSimple fix\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow 1734](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1734) issues and references them in the PR title. It's in regards to the Sqoop Operator and Hook and how it contains logic errors & needs options to pass more sqoop options.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nAfter taking a look at the Sqoop Operator I have found a number of errors with it. It includes assigning wrong parameters, not hiding the users raw password in the logs (though a method to do that had been created in the hook, wrong if conditions, and the inability to add other Sqoop options that would make sense to have the option to pass those.\r\n\r\nI will also make notes in the exact places in the code where I noticed these mishaps.\r\n\r\nI have made some remarks in past commits about it too in the case I'm misinterpreting but regardless there are definitely errors.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2177#pullrequestreview-70046796\r\n\r\nThis PR is for both bug fixes, and enhancements to the hook/operator.\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nAdds unit testing for newer functionality\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1718\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nCurrently, `num_retries = 0` when [execute() is called](https://google.github.io/google-api-python-client/docs/epy/googleapiclient.http.HttpRequest-class.html#execute), which causes [intermittent 500 errors](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46522261/deadline-exceeded-when-airflow-runs-spark-jobs). We should increase this to allow retries for internal Dataproc queries to other services in the short-term; also seeing if the `num_retries` count can be increased at the google-api-python-client level in the long-term.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nNo unit tests are needed; it's a one argument change. Unit tests for gcp_dataproc_hook incoming in [AIRFLOW-1727].\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1246\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nThis PR fixes the problem that occurs from flask_admin duplicating periods (its CHAR_ESCAPE value) in primary keys it returns. I've written a reversing function given that it appears that this functionality is intentional in flask_admin. I then use this reversing function on the task and DAG ids in the clear and update status actions of the Task Instance View.\r\n\r\nCommits:\r\n[AIRFLOW-1246] Setting a Subdag Task State Throws Exception\r\n    Add flask_admin_unescape function to airfow.www.views\r\n\r\nAdd flask_admin_unescape for Id's in TaskInstanceModelView clear action\r\n\r\nAdd flask_admin_unescape for Id's in TaskInstanceModelView state action\r\n\r\nAdd Test for flask_admin_unescape function\r\n\r\nMove flask_admin_unescape function to airflow.www.utils\r\n\r\nMove test_flask_admin_unescape to airflow.tests.www.test_utils\r\n\r\nAdd Return and Param Documentation for flask_admin_unescape Function\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nairflow.tests.www.test_utils.UtilsTest.test_flask_admin_unescape\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-10-14T20:21:13Z","updated_at":"2018-03-02T17:57:31Z","closed_at":"2018-03-02T17:55:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0cd0d43b15138fbedc9a747ab13b1c3446fc6ff2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2691/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2691/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2691/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/432fa196f917d0abc3af186994147245d2d29131","head":{"label":"zack3241:AIRFLOW-1246_dev","ref":"AIRFLOW-1246_dev","sha":"432fa196f917d0abc3af186994147245d2d29131","user":{"login":"zack3241","id":22421878,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDIxODc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22421878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zack3241","html_url":"https://github.com/zack3241","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zack3241/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zack3241/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zack3241/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zack3241/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zack3241/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zack3241/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zack3241/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zack3241/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zack3241/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":91010596,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5MTAxMDU5Ng==","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"zack3241/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zack3241","id":22421878,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDIxODc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22421878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zack3241","html_url":"https://github.com/zack3241","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zack3241/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zack3241/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zack3241/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zack3241/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zack3241/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zack3241/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zack3241/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zack3241/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zack3241/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zack3241/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-914\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nBackfillJobTest.test_backfill_examples takes over 5 minutes to execute\r\non Travis and it's about 25% of the entire time. Disabling it on Travis\r\nmakes more quick feedback for developers possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nNo additional test, since it's modification for test code itself.\r\nI confirmed on Travis that test_backfill_examples was skipped and the running time was significantly reduced. For example, the time for Python 2.7 x MySQL is reduced from 21 min 4 sec to 16 min 50 sec.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-10-14T06:19:58Z","updated_at":"2018-12-10T08:45:39Z","closed_at":"2018-12-10T08:45:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"242b2051f8e9338e90e9bd9ca912240ef23e1c11","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2690/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2690/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2690/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/edd3cdb5e723035815b21a6f5cd920a3f38cb971","head":{"label":"sekikn:AIRFLOW-914","ref":"AIRFLOW-914","sha":"edd3cdb5e723035815b21a6f5cd920a3f38cb971","user":{"login":"sekikn","id":898388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5ODM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/898388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn","html_url":"https://github.com/sekikn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":59171319,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1OTE3MTMxOQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"sekikn/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sekikn","id":898388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5ODM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/898388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn","html_url":"https://github.com/sekikn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sekikn/airflow","description":"Apache

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1712\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n  - After commiting AIRFLOW-756 and AIRFLOW-751, SSHOperator does not log stdout like SSHExecutor did. This commit logs SSHOperator stdout again.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n  - There are already SSHOperator tests to assert that do_xcom_push keeps saving output.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-10-13T08:02:01Z","updated_at":"2017-11-07T15:21:52Z","closed_at":"2017-11-02T08:35:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"936060a4182d40ddae119d544f8483a1124e34a8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2686/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2686/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2686/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/83c26102b6314b5e81d2ddb722093aab5d8dc62a","head":{"label":"OpringaoDoTurno:bring-ssh-logs-back","ref":"bring-ssh-logs-back","sha":"83c26102b6314b5e81d2ddb722093aab5d8dc62a","user":{"login":"OpringaoDoTurno","id":1423551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjM1NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1423551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/OpringaoDoTurno","html_url":"https://github.com/OpringaoDoTurno","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OpringaoDoTurno/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OpringaoDoTurno/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OpringaoDoTurno/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OpringaoDoTurno/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OpringaoDoTurno/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OpringaoDoTurno/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OpringaoDoTurno/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OpringaoDoTurno/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OpringaoDoTurno/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"9f2c16a0ac261888fe2ee4671538201c273f82d5","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":33884891,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzg4NDg5MQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"apache/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow","description":"Apache

However, for connection types like \"hive_cli\" and \"google_cloud_platform\", urlparse (by design) was unable to get the connection type as '_' is not a valid scheme character.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n-

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nAllow users to batch clear selected task instance(s) in task instance view. Only state(s) of selected task instance(s) will be cleared--no upstream nor downstream task instance will be affected.\r\n\r\nDAG(s) involved will be set to \"RUNNING\" state, same as existing \"clear\" operation.\r\n\r\nKeeping both \"Delete\" and \"Clear\" operations for more smooth user habit transition--informing DAG state change in pop-up (check screenshots).\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2017-10-11 at 11 53 47 am](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7818710/31460338-f08d63a2-ae7a-11e7-99bb-029a78b43b9c.png)\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2017-10-11 at 11 53 57 am](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7818710/31460344-f4b091de-ae7a-11e7-8bf7-12c46e86f4ff.png)\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nAll changes are within front-end views.py file, which is not currently covered by unit test.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1674\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nexample_trigger_controller_dag can't pass conf parameter properly\r\nto example_trigger_target_dag at least with SQLite backend, since\r\nthe format for execution_date is inconsistent between dag_run and\r\ntask_instance. This PR makes TriggerDagRunOperator pass \r\nexecution_date to DAG#create_dagrun so as to fix it.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nCoreTest.test_trigger_dagrun_with_same_execution_date\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-10-10T09:10:55Z","updated_at":"2018-05-21T18:54:38Z","closed_at":"2018-05-18T00:19:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0b225ffa36dc72b0da12d3bd198ac97e3fe8b345","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2678/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2678/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2678/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/f83ed1e93a367fa057851ffd497d6b73026819fb","head":{"label":"sekikn:AIRFLOW-1674","ref":"AIRFLOW-1674","sha":"f83ed1e93a367fa057851ffd497d6b73026819fb","user":{"login":"sekikn","id":898388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5ODM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/898388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn","html_url":"https://github.com/sekikn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":59171319,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1OTE3MTMxOQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"sekikn/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sekikn","id":898388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5ODM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/898388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn","html_url":"https://github.com/sekikn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sekikn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sekikn/airflow","description":"Apache

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1696\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nReplaces '+' with '-' when adding the Airflow version label to the dataproc operator to comply with the Dataproc label character set. Thus, '1.10.0dev0+incubating' is reported as '1-10-0dev0-incubating'\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n- Modifies tests.contrib.operators.test_dataproc_operator.test_build_cluster_data\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-10-09T22:23:06Z","updated_at":"2017-10-12T04:17:08Z","closed_at":"2017-10-11T20:29:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0153b46506bc13082752ccd684a84a7b660aa6c6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2676/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2676/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2676/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/1681818726093f8ac52e629e0debdcf04819ec18","head":{"label":"TrevorEdwards:airflow-1696","ref":"airflow-1696","sha":"1681818726093f8ac52e629e0debdcf04819ec18","user":{"login":"TrevorEdwards","id":11479672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDc5Njcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11479672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrevorEdwards","html_url":"https://github.com/TrevorEdwards","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrevorEdwards/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrevorEdwards/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrevorEdwards/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrevorEdwards/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrevorEdwards/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrevorEdwards/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrevorEdwards/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrevorEdwards/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrevorEdwards/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":97792616,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5Nzc5MjYxNg==","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"TrevorEdwards/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"TrevorEdwards","id":11479672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDc5Njcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11479672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrevorEdwards","html_url":"https://github.com/TrevorEdwards","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrevorEdwards/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrevorEdwards/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrevorEdwards/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrevorEdwards/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrevorEdwards/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrevorEdwards/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrevorEdwards/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrevorEdwards/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TrevorEdwards/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/TrevorEdwards/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1694\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n`itertools` no longer contains `izip()`, but the builtin `zip()` now returns an iterator. We had a use of `itertools.izip()` in hive_hooks.py, which I've changed to use `siz.moves.zip` (so it works with both python 2/3)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nThat part of the code is already unit-tested, and this change only makes it work with Python 3.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1669\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nCorrect imports for `docker-py` are\r\n```\r\n from docker import Client, tls\r\n```\r\nfixed these in the docker operator and unit tests\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\ntested on command line\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ virtualenv docker-py && . docker-py/bin/activate && pip install \"docker-py>=1.6.0\"\r\n[...]\r\nSuccessfully installed docker-py-1.10.6\r\n\r\n$ python -c \"import docker; print docker.__version__\"\r\n1.10.6\r\n\r\n$ python -c \"from docker import APIClient as Client, tls\"\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<string>\", line 1, in <module>\r\nImportError: cannot import name APIClient\r\n\r\n$ python -c \"from docker import Client, tls\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-10-04T19:54:15Z","updated_at":"2019-01-14T11:21:27Z","closed_at":"2019-01-14T11:21:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4ce37ceb56eaca591e392c1ba87b429598fb88a7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2663/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2663/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2663/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/b9922ad2a73813b81b4b502e0f21a34065e19dca","head":{"label":"Twistbioscience:master","ref":"master","sha":"b9922ad2a73813b81b4b502e0f21a34065e19dca","user":{"login":"Twistbioscience","id":13425022,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjEzNDI1MDIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13425022?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Twistbioscience","html_url":"https://github.com/Twistbioscience","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Twistbioscience/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Twistbioscience/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Twistbioscience/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Twistbioscience/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Twistbioscience/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Twistbioscience/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Twistbioscience/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Twistbioscience/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Twistbioscience/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"11a36d17f22d89c97100c875cb01e8e6105a94cc","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":33884891,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzg4NDg5MQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"apache/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow","description":"Apache

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1554) issues and references them in the PR title. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] The DagFileProcessorManager.set_file_paths() function was incorrectly calling processor.stop() instead of processor.terminate(). This would cause an AttributeError to be thrown and the scheduler to hang, not processing any future DAGs.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests:\r\n\\tests\\utils\\test_dag_processing.py\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Airflow task instance colors so that color blind users can see them. If people don't like this change or don't think they can get used to it we can implement an accessibility mode instead but that's a lot more work and I think these colors are fine. This change isn't perfect since there are other task instance states but this will solve the issue for 95%+ of the cases.\r\n\r\nHere is what the new colors look like (in the order of failed/running/success), the dark blue circles don't have the strange outlines on the actual

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nWe want to fix the Docker import. At the revert of AIRFLOW-1368 something went wrong. Currently master is not building. I've checked, and before AIRFLOW-1368 we've used `docker-py` (not `docker`) package. This package exposes the APIClient for the low-level docker communication.\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR.

Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1457\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nuser-defined logging configuration provided as part of AIRFLOW-1457 is broken- current code tries to import a string value pulled from the config. This always fails and results in the default config being loaded.\r\n\r\nSince contents of `logging_config_path` will get passed to `logging.config.DictConfig` as a dictionary, it should be json de/serializable and so we can use `json.load` to read the file instead.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nI can add tests at some point if you want, but settings.py currently does not have any unit tests and this is a pretty core functionality that is broken so I really just want to get it working :)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [AIRFLOW-1658](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1658) issues and references them in the PR title. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] If the total execution time of a Druid task exceeds the max timeout\r\ndefined, the Airflow task fails, but the Druid task may still keep\r\nrunning. This can cause undesired behaviour if Airflow retries the\r\ntask. This patch calls the shutdown endpoint on the Druid task to\r\nkill any still running Druid task.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] Added mock to test call to Druid task shutdown endpoint is correct.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1657/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes: This PR is to handle the failing qubole operator with hadoopcmd s3distcp arguments. Its because this case is now handled in qds-sdk, where the Qubole commands are submitted, and hence we dont need to take care of it here.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason: We are here removing the hardcoded part of parsing the string in a different manner for hadoopcmd types of commands. Hence no special test cases are needed\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1323) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nThis PR cleans up Dataproc operators by renaming same parameters to be called by the same names:\r\n* `gcp_conn_id` and `google_cloud_conn_id` are now both `gcp_conn_id`.\r\n* `dataproc_cluster` and `cluster_name` are now both `cluster_name`. Because these parameters are all of type `Dataproc{*}Operator`, `cluster_name` seems more useful/less redundant.\r\n\r\nThese two are the only overlapping parameter names, based on a cursory look at the other arguments used in the `Dataproc{*}Operator`s.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nNo tests were added for this variable rename as no functionality is being changed; the unit tests referring to this particular class were already using a `gcp_conn_id` and `cluster_name` variable name. This change passes all local Travis builds.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1561\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nThe scheduler doesn't pick up example dags unless there is at least 1 dag in dags folder. This is confusing for those who try it for the first time.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n* tests.jobs.SchedulerJobTest.test_list_py_file_paths\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1635) issue and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nAdds a new field to the Connections screen for GCP connections, allowing the user to provide key credentials as JSON data, rather than a JSON file. This allows creating or managing GCP connections without requiring access to the Airflow server and worker(s).\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of the updated \"Create connection\" form](https://github.com/barrywhart/incubator-airflow/blob/master/AIRFLOW-1635.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nThe changes are small enhancements to existing code that does not have tests. It only affects GCP connections, which is \"contrib\" code.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1642\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nThe alembic script does not use a [scoped_session](http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/orm/contextual.html#sqlalchemy.orm.scoping.scoped_session), which could potentially cause deadlocks (see JIRA for an example scenario of this). Using settings.Session() instead will create a scoped session.\r\nNote: This alembic script is introduced after the current stable release, so *should* be safe to modify. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nRan migration script locally for testing. Unit tests not applicable here.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-09-25T21:11:49Z","updated_at":"2019-02-11T10:32:49Z","closed_at":"2018-12-28T04:42:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0b8c5484d1b2c2f9eeb3383fbbd5f3f2c279f209","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nThe current way of loading a custom logging config using the logging_config_path does not work:\r\nhttps://codecov.io/gh/Fokko/incubator-airflow/src/master/airflow/settings.py#L180\r\n\r\nTherefore I would like suggest to change this so we can import a logger configuration that is defined in Python using a dict. The logging_config_path property in the config file can be used to point to a custom logging configuration which will be imported.\r\n\r\nChange the configuration of the logging to make use of the python logging and make the configuration easy configurable. Some of the settings which are now not needed anymore since they can easily be implemented in the Python config dict itself.\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title.

In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-09-25T20:52:39Z","updated_at":"2017-10-02T15:14:45Z","closed_at":"2017-10-02T15:14:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"61ce9607a29b19310c51ec47ae1385957298cc32","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2631/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2631/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2631/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/d71aff150512e1f46fabeaa2212989d0e5a6c5b2","head":{"label":"Fokko:AIRFLOW-1611-customize-logging-in-airflow","ref":"AIRFLOW-1611-customize-logging-in-airflow","sha":"d71aff150512e1f46fabeaa2212989d0e5a6c5b2","user":{"login":"Fokko","id":1134248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko","html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":60533353,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MDUzMzM1Mw==","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"Fokko/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Fokko","id":1134248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko","html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-71\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1669\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n#### [AIRFLOW-1669] Docker import\r\nThis PR fixes the Docker import by restoring it to what it was before #2411 was merged. In the meantime, Moto has [added a dependency](https://github.com/spulec/moto/pull/1048) on the `docker` package for some Lambda magic. This is not being used here, so the Moto version is being pinned to `1.1.19` which is the version preceding the change.\r\n#### [AIRFLOW-71] Add support for private Docker images\r\nThis PR adds support for pulling images from private Docker repositories. To accomplish this, a new Docker hook is added, using [the `login` method](https://docker-py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/client.html#docker.client.DockerClient.login).\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests ~__OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:~\r\n#### In `tests/operators/docker_operator.py`\r\n  - `test_execute_no_docker_conn_id_no_hook`: Ensures **backwards compatibility** by checking that the hook is not used/accessed when no `docker_conn_id` is passed.\r\n  - `test_execute_with_docker_conn_id_use_hook`: Checks that the hook is used and the image pulled accordingly\r\n\r\n#### In `tests/contrib/hooks/test_docker_hook.py`\r\n  - `test_get_conn_defaults` checks that the defaults are set correctly\r\n  - `test_get_conn_override_defaults` checks that defaults can be overridden\r\n  - `test_get_conn_with_standard_config` checks that a stored config can be read\r\n  - `test_get_conn_with_extra_config` checks that a stored config with extras can be read\r\n  - `test_conn_with_standard_config_passes_parameters` checks that the standard parameters are correctly read from the database and passed to the hook\r\n  - `test_conn_with_extra_config_passes_parameters` checks that extra parameters are correctly read from the database and passed to the hook\r\n  - `test_conn_with_broken_config_missing_username_fails` proves we raise an error if no username has been specified for the connection\r\n  - `test_conn_with_broken_config_missing_host_fails` proves we raise an error if no host (registry URL) has been specified for the connection\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1576) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    -https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1576\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nCurrently, the `DataProcHadoopOperator`, `DataProcSparkOperator`, `DataProcPySparkOperator`, and `DataProcHiveOperator` (found in [`dataproc_operator.py`](https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/blob/master/airflow/contrib/operators/dataproc_operator.py)) default to using a `global` cluster. We add a region parameter to these operators with support in the corresponding [`gcp_dataproc_hook.py`](https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/blob/master/airflow/contrib/hooks/gcp_dataproc_hook.py) so that users can specify cluster regions (ex. _us-central1_, etc.)\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nMy PR adds tests to [`test_dataproc_operator.py`](https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/blob/master/tests/contrib/operators/test_dataproc_operator.py) to ensure that the region parameter is passed through to the appropriate hook. Also, I've integraton-tested this by running a HadoopOperator with the new region param as follows.\r\n```\r\n    RUN_CENTRAL1_DATAPROC_HADOOP = DataProcHadoopOperator(\r\n        task_id='run_central1_dataproc_hadoop',\r\n        main_jar=WORDCOUNT_JAR,\r\n        dataproc_cluster='test-cluster-a',\r\n        region='us-central1',\r\n        arguments=WORDCOUNT_ARGS\r\n        )\r\n```\r\n[Here](https://screenshot.googleplex.com/vcdUQtd1i8Q) is the successful result in Cloud Console.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-289\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nAirflow mixes datetime.now()/today() and utcnow(). This can lead\r\nto issues in case the OS is not in UTC.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nCurrent tests should cover this\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n@criccomini @saguziel @aoen \r\n\r\nPlease note it should not affect systems that are running in UTC as is the best practice. It just makes it possible to run Airflow on a non UTC
