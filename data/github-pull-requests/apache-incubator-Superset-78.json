SUMMARY\r\nWhen requesting samples from a dataset, a `GROUP BY` was incorrectly added to the query due to the `metrics` parameter in the `QueryObject` being set to an empty list. This adds unnecessary computational expense to the query and doesn't reflect the raw data correctly by hiding potential duplicates in the underlying data. This PR fixes the bug, adds assertions to existing tests to ensure the sample query is executed without a `GROUP BY` clause and adds instructions to the API spec on what the difference is between a `null` vs empty array for the `metrics` parameter.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Go to explore and open the Network tab in the Chrome debugger \r\n2. Click on \"Samples\"\r\n3. Notice that the query in the chart data request previously included a `GROUP BY` clause.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include

SUMMARY\r\nWhen opening a dashboard or a chart in Explore, the URL will update with a new state key every time the page is reloaded even when the state isn't updated. This may not be scalable in high-traffic Superset deployments where it can quickly fill up disk space or exhaust the number of cache keys too fast, due to memory restrictions, making it more likely that a link you shared with someone a while ago becomes invalid.\r\n\r\nTo address this problem we should consider the request context such as user ID, resource ID, etc, to generate new keys only when the context changes. This way we can reuse existing keys but at the same time maintain the uniqueness of storage spaces for different users/dashboards/datasets/charts.\r\n\r\nWe could use HMAC to generate the same key for the same context but that would require key rotation management.\r\n\r\nWe can’t base key generation on previous keys because we have POST scenarios where the key is not present. One example would be when the user is inside a dashboard and selects “View chart in Explore”.\r\n\r\nWe can’t change the structure of the cache key to use the user and resource because this information is not present in the GET/DELETE requests and it would also require keeping backward compatibility with previous versions.\r\n\r\nTo implement the desired behavior we’ll keep a secondary mapping of user and resources with the previously generated keys. We'll store this mapping together with the entry so they’ll share the same expiration time. We’ll also keep it in sync with DELETE events. That way we can reuse the keys and keep the solution backward compatible.\r\n\r\nHat tip to @zhaoyongjie and @ktmud for bringing this concern during the reviews 👏🏼 \r\n\r\nFollow-up of

SUMMARY\r\nEnable switching between displaying epoch (original value) and time formatted value (format: YYYY-mm-dd HH:MM:SS).\r\n\r\nTemporal columns in data table (tabs \"Data\" and \"Samples\") now have a clickable \"gear\" icon, which opens a popover that allows switching between 2 display modes. \r\n\r\nSelected display mode is specific to each column - user can select different display modes for each temporal column. The selection is also specific to datasource, meaning if there are temporal columns that have the same name in 2 datasources, those columns can have different display modes.\r\n\r\nSelection is saved in local storage - when user reloads the page, changes hart config etc., it will be persisted.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/152353312-3abe36c5-1f23-4e72-8afc-991471b7722f.mov\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Create a chart with some temporal columns\r\n2. Open data table below the chart - temporal columns should have \"gear\" icons on their left sides\r\n3. Click the icon and select \"Formatted time\"\r\n4. Verify that the displayed values for that column have changed from long numbers to human readable dates\r\n5. Reload the page, verify that your selections have been saved\r\n6. Switch between datasources, verify that the selections are specific for each datasource\r\n7. Perform the above testing instructions for charts using V1 API and legacy API\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\"

SUMMARY\r\nSuperset was not allowing to run CTE based SQLs on MSSQL while creating virtual tables, because MSSQL is not supporting CTE in subquery. Always the CTE sql should be at the top. Hence added the fix to make the SQL to run as same as CTE, this feature can be used for all the databases. Added a new flag called \"allows_cte_in_subquery\" , if it's True, Superset will parse CTE as Subquery and run it else Superset will run the CTE as same as it is. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nUpdating the current process of exporting dashboard native filter configurations to store uuids vs chartids. The problem is when users export charts from 1 superset instance (workspace) to another the chart id reference aren't the same. So fix that we are allowing the native filters to leverage uuids from the charts and then updating them once they are properly loaded into the workspace/instance.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nThis fixes a bug in the ECharts timeseries chart, where using a metric with a verbose name caused the forecast and observations to be on separate series (one with the verbose name, and the other with the raw name).  A test is also added that ensures  verbose names are correctly handled going forward. In addition, all references to \"prophet\" are replaced with \"forecast\" in preparation for decoupling the forecasting functionality from Prophet.\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\nNow the metric with a verbose name displays correctly in both the chart and the tooltip:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/152132685-52f45233-95b0-4340-b133-cbfedca391a4.png)\r\n\r\nThe forecast section is also split up into one control per line:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/152132789-248e68e2-2b8e-4fef-a198-7a101a9820b4.png)\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\nPreviously, the predictions would show up as different series with their non-verbose name, both on the chart and the tooltip\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/152132159-755c8b80-d11c-439f-8b5c-f06ad084e3c4.png)\r\n\r\nBefore, the forecast section headers wrapping caused the controls to be misaligned:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/152132993-499704f0-5935-4c6e-9bff-dec4f65de9da.png)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1.

SUMMARY\r\nWhen the label formatting was deciding whether to use number formatter or time formatter, it first checked if value is a number and if not, it checked if value is Date or column type is temporal. Timestamp values are numbers, so the first condition was true and number formatter was being used for timestamps.

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently, when user switches datasource, controls such as metrics, group by, filters etc. are being reset. This PR changes that behaviour - after switching datasource, controls that use columns or saved metrics that are present in both previous and current datasource are preserved. After that, we display an alert that let's user decide if they want to reset the chart config or keep the changes. If there were no controls using columns nor metrics that matched the new dataset, we display a \"warning\" alert that informs user that chart config was reset.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/151549614-98b0baa9-2635-4c33-8908-1f255ba5ae0b.mov\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/151549652-ff6caa55-23e4-494c-9e27-96084863f9f9.mov\r\n\r\nEDIT: new copy\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/151557817-7f0a648d-59a6-41cc-8f7c-6d44f2e7fb1e.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/151557877-c7b5ab9f-9f7c-4772-8339-0f108efbbf4d.png)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n0. Turn on drag and drop feature flag\r\n1. Open a chart\r\n2. Add some columns and metrics to controls\r\n3. Change dataset\r\n4. If some of the columns or metrics that you used in controls are present in the new dataset, those controls should keep their state and an info alert should appear with 2 button - \"Clear form\" and \"Continue\". Clicking \"Continue\" should close the alert, clicking \"Clear form\" should reset the controls and close the alert.\r\n5. If none of the columns or metrics that you used in controls are present in the new dataset, a warning alert should appear with button \"Continue\", that closes the alert.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nA new feature called assignment expressions has been added to Python v3.8. A new syntactical operator— “The Walrus Operator” is part of it. The syntax of it is not backward compatible.\r\n\r\nThe minimum Python version supported by Apache Superset is 3.7, so we can not use any v3.8+ non-backward compatible features of Python.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/blob/568b8e160fc8f3d2965ec3ac8a6d0fd6f20a860f/setup.py#L172-L176\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

when a chart alert condition is matched, Superset will do force_refresh query and generate a screenshot. We also had db migration to set all chart alerts' force_refresh attribute be true.\r\nBut when user create new chart alert, its force_refresh is false. This PR is to fix this issue, and set force_refresh default be true when creating new chart alert.\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nCI and manual test: \r\n1. create a new alert\r\n2. check its `force_refresh` value from report_scedule table.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing

SUMMARY\r\nThe objective of this PR is to fix the long URL problem In Explore. We had a function called `getExploreLongUrl` in `src/explore/exploreUtils` that was responsible for generating a URL with the contents of `form_data`. That was problematic because `form_data` can contain a lot of data which resulted in URL length-related errors. To fix this problem, https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/18151 created an endpoint called `/explore/form_data` where we can store this information on the server-side. This PR uses this endpoint to store `form_data` information and only keeps the generated key in the URL.\r\n\r\nAnother objective of the PR is to maintain backward compatibility with previously generated short URLs. We also want to generate new URLs every time the page loads to avoid content override by different users using the same shared URL. At the same time, after loading the page we want to preserve the generated URL and update its content as the user interacts with the page.\r\n\r\nThe `/explore` endpoint is using the old API and it contains a lot of complex logic related to the features in Explore so is NOT an objective of this PR to make big refactors that can potentially introduce regressions. I tried to preserve the original endpoint with the added feature. We should tackle this work in follow-up PRs, probably during the migration for the new API.\r\n\r\nThere's another function in `src/explore/exploreUtils` called `getExploreUrl` that transfers a pruned version of `form_data` using the URL and it's being used by the legacy charts and filter boxes. This will be tackled in another PR as it involves possible soon-to-be deprecated code.\r\n\r\nWe also have an endpoint called `/explore_json` that has the potential of being replaced by the new `/explore/form_data` endpoint but requires significant refactoring. This change is not in the scope of this PR.\r\n\r\n### AFTER VIDEO\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70410625/151230992-e463f0ad-ce45-4420-894a-ff10ebb36508.mov\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n- Play with Explore controls and check if your state is preserved while refreshing or opening the URL in another tab\r\n- Check if the actions that generate an URL are using the new `form_data_key` parameter\r\n- Check if you can navigate from a dashboard to Explore without losing context\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [x] Has associated issue: closes #18198\r\n- [ ]

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nWhen our Helm Chart is used in composition additional properties might be added extra properties than defined by us eg. `global`, `enabled`. In #18161 we restricted available properties with comment:\r\n\r\n> I can see that overwhelmingly required fields may appear now. Removing these requirements requires very careful verification in multiple parameters that the Helm Chart is prepared to render without the parameter, which I intend to do when we work on the rendering tests. (...) \r\n> I think it's better to agree on the structure and notation of the schema and then relax & extend when working with Helm Chart is less fragile (more tests added).\r\n\r\nTo avoid scenario like that in future we should add that scenario to tests in #18127 .\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nExample error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n▶ helm install superset-v2 . -f values.yaml --dry-run > deploy-logs.yaml\r\ncoalesce.go:162: warning: skipped value for extraEnv: Not a table.\r\nError: INSTALLATION FAILED: values don't meet the specifications of the schema(s) in the following chart(s):\r\nsuperset:\r\n- (root): Additional property global is not allowed\r\n- (root): Additional property enabled is not allowed\r\n```\r\n\r\n`values.yaml` content:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nsuperset:\r\n  enabled: true\r\n  #image:\r\n  #  repository: apache/superset\r\n  #  tag: 1.4.0\r\n  postgresql:\r\n    # Create postgres locally for development purposes only.\r\n    enabled: true\r\n```\r\n\r\n`Chart.yaml` content:\r\n```yaml\r\napiVersion: v2\r\nname: superset\r\ndescription: A Helm chart for Superset\r\n\r\ntype: application\r\nversion: 0.0.1\r\nappVersion: 1.14.0\r\n\r\ndependencies:\r\n- name: superset\r\n  repository: https://apache.github.io/superset\r\n  version: 0.5.5\r\n  condition: superset.enabled\r\n```\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\ncloses: https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/18147\r\nCurrently, Superset Filter can't show **NULL value** and **empty string**. This PR replaced **NULL** with `<NULL>`  and replaced **\"\"** with `<empty string>`\r\n\r\nNotice that: A known limitation for the current design, users can't filter below text values:\r\n```\r\n- \"<empty string>\"\r\n- \"<NULL>\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nwe need to add to escape mechanism somewhere in separated PR.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n### After\r\n<img width=\"846\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2016594/151127678-5d5dda42-00f4-42f0-bfd8-2eacf65c27db.png\">\r\n\r\n### Before\r\n<img width=\"895\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2016594/151127799-a945003d-4918-4d51-9379-9f885c47aa31.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n1. Create a virtual dataset\r\n```\r\nSELECT '' as name\r\nUNION ALL\r\nSELECT null as name\r\nunion all\r\nSELECT 'foo' as name\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Open the virtual dataset in Explore Page\r\n3. Drag **name** column in Filter Control\r\n4. You can get 3 options in the filter selection\r\n5. Add all options and open query inspector. The query is:\r\n```\r\nSELECT count(*) AS count\r\nFROM\r\n  (SELECT '' as name\r\n   UNION ALL SELECT null as name\r\n   union all SELECT 'foo' as name) AS virtual_table\r\nWHERE name IS NULL\r\n  OR name IN ('',\r\n              'foo',)\r\nORDER BY count DESC\r\nLIMIT 1000;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [x] Has associated issue: https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/18147\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB

SUMMARY\r\nThis fix resolves an issue where Javascript fields could not be edited in the DeckGL Scatterplot advanced section because of incompatible argument types passed to the onChange handler. The incompatible arguments (object provided, string expected) resulted in exceptions being raised in the onChange handler.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nIn release 1.4, when editing any of the Javascipt handlers in the DeckGL Scatterplot advanced section, characters would be inserted multiple times and the text cursor would be repositioned to the end of the text with every character entered. This makes editing the text area impossible. \r\n\r\nWith this fix applied, the text area is editable as expected.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nI added schema validation for `values.yaml` as designed in #18127. My goal was to add a basic schema and then gradually expand it. I attempt to use remote schemas wherever possible.\r\n\r\nI can see that overwhelmingly required fields may appear now. Removing these requirements requires very careful verification in multiple parameters that the Helm Chart is prepared to render without the parameter, which I intend to do when we work on the rendering tests.\r\n\r\nI see that the provided schema can document more (more field descriptions, examples etc.), but I leave it for the next PR to do small steps together.\r\n\r\nI think it's better to agree on the structure and notation of the schema and then relax & extend when working with Helm Chart is less fragile (more tests added).\r\n\r\nI am aware that installation on air-gapped environments (due to the need to download remote schematics) will be blocked. However, I would also leave that for the next PR to make this PR easier to review.\r\n\r\nIf I had the permission to create a new branch in the `apache/superset` repository, I would create this PR against the feature branch, because the primary goal is to get insights on the approach, and the space for development is significant. However, I believe that this code already provides some value and is functional.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n\r\nYou might change `values.yaml` and execute `helm lint` to make sure that linting errors are raised.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose, I keep in that PR two commits to ensure that CI detect mismatch `values.yaml` to `values.schema.json` thanks to `.github/workflows/superset-helm-lint.yml`. If it turns out otherwise - I will update that PR.\r\n \r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an

SUMMARY\r\nThe objective of this PR is to move the Explore `form_data` endpoint from `/charts` to `/explore`. This change became clear when analyzing the type of data contained in `form_data` and the security rules that should be applied to the endpoint.  The `/explore` endpoint is done under the `v1` API and all security checks were kept the same. We still check for dataset and chart access independently of each other.\r\n\r\nI also implemented some suggestions made by @ktmud during the review process of https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/17882:\r\n- Enhanced the `Entry` structure to also store the `dataset_id` and `chart_id` which will allow us to only keep the key in the URL\r\n- Removed the hacky `chart_id == 0` in the URL by creating a specific endpoint\r\n\r\nFollow-up of https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/17882\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1 - Execute all tests\r\n2 - All tests should pass\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis PR is to fix the problem that ace-editor in control panel throws an error when the user typing. The reason for this is that we use an `onChange` callback where the second parameter is an error array by default (see https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset-frontend/src/explore/components/Control.tsx#L65). But for ace-editor, the second parameter of `onChange` is an `event`, so we need to wrap it to avoid this exception.\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n### before\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11830681/150685730-d15b6283-a333-4f47-9f01-1fb0d8eb6dfc.mov\r\n\r\n### after\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11830681/150685838-c969edae-84c4-446b-ba0e-ae48ff8b5434.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!
