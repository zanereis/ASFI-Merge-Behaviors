Disabled Actions (strange style)\r\n- [x] 6. Where's the default Flatly color gone?\r\n- [x] 7. Table Paging Support\r\n- [x] 8. DateTime picker on empty field, has the browser interfere using autocompletion (seen on firefox)  \r\n- [x] 9. Responsive design behavior of main menu got lost (partly fixed but not production ready)\r\n- [x] 10. Reasess ISIS-2390\r\n- [x] 11. Menu item labels have wrong mouse over cursor style, but only some, not all - these which are 'defect' also render in a stronger foreground color\r\n- [x] 12. Bookmark links are inactive, cannot click on these (when there's only a single bookmark)\r\n- [x] 13. Tertiary menu has a different base-line\r\n- [x] 14. Title fontsize too large (minor)\r\n- [ ] 15. Bookmark color should be same as theme foreground (minor) [WON'T FIX]\r\n- [x] 16. Mouse Over Drop Down is gone (Main menu and Theme Select)\r\n- [x] 17. Action Drop Down should have consistent styling (font) with Menu Drop Down\r\n- [x] 18. Menus: Mouse over Tooltip has the menu lose focus then it goes hiding. (no issues with firefox, but issues with chrome)\r\n- [x] 19. Menus: Disabled Menu Items should render visually distinguishable (grey), also having cursor style 'disabled'\r\n- [x] 20. Missing mouse over auto drop-down behavior on Action Drop Downs\r\n- [x] 21. With a line-wrapped menu-bar, we have 'menu going into hiding' issues again\r\n- [x] 22. Maybe we can get rid of CSS magic #body{  padding-top: 61px; }, as it is inconsistent with menu-bar line wrapping support\r\n- [x] 23. Menu-bar disappears on vertical scroll\r\n- [ ] 24. Dropdown menu auto open will not work for elements of the DOM that are added via AJAX (eg. Tabs?)\r\n- [ ] 25. When clicking an action button that has a popover (i.e. to edit a text field) then the popover doesn't automatically close\r\n- [x] 26. Bookmark ribbon has too much vertical size\r\n- [x] 27. Menu-bar brand-Icon (as of sticky-top fix) dictates the navbar height; maybe we find a consistent way to have the menu-bar a little smaller regarding vertical size\r\n<!-- Reviewable:start
