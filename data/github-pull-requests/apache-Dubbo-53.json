Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-01-29T12:00:38Z","updated_at":"2020-06-15T02:28:22Z","closed_at":"2020-01-31T04:21:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5f4c09eb587044c1cb8d607eb1c099036c569d4f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5698/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5698/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5698/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/0fdeccb41af585181cffc0b05532b6549ff2bc29","head":{"label":"lovepoem:add_jdk14_in_travis","ref":"add_jdk14_in_travis","sha":"0fdeccb41af585181cffc0b05532b6549ff2bc29","user":{"login":"lovepoem","id":827112,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNzExMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/827112?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovepoem","html_url":"https://github.com/lovepoem","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovepoem/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovepoem/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovepoem/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovepoem/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovepoem/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovepoem/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovepoem/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovepoem/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovepoem/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":188452349,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODg0NTIzNDk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"lovepoem/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lovepoem","id":827112,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNzExMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/827112?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovepoem","html_url":"https://github.com/lovepoem","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovepoem/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovepoem/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovepoem/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovepoem/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovepoem/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovepoem/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovepoem/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovepoem/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovepoem/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lovepoem/dubbo","description":"Apache

found a problem that may have existed all the time, that is, our token mechanism has not been used correctly. This problem existed in dubbo-2.5.3, which I used before. Recently, when I used dubbo-2.7.5, I found that this problem still exists.\r\n\r\n现象：\r\n当token设置成true时，provider没有将token的UUID正确注入到注册中心的bug，例如：\r\nPhenomenon:\r\nWhen the token is set to true, the provider does not correctly inject the UUID of the token into the bug in the registry, for example:\r\n`<dubbo:provider token=\"true\" filter=\"SystemParamProviderFilter,DLProviderFilter,MetricsProviderFilter\"/>`\r\n\r\n我在provider端暴露了一个dubbo协议的接口：com.manzhizhen.dubbo.api.Dubbo1Service，结果我在注册中心上（zookeeper）看到的结果如下：\r\nI exposed an interface of Dubbo protocol on the provider side: com.manzhen.dubbo.api.dubbo1service. As a result, the results I saw on the zookeeper are as follows:\r\n```\r\n[zk: localhost:2181(CONNECTED) 12] ls /dubbo/com.manzhizhen.dubbo.api.Dubbo1Service/providers\r\n[dubbo://192.168.1.6:4445/com.manzhizhen.dubbo.api.Dubbo1Service?anyhost=true&application=mzz-dubbo1&deprecated=false&dubbo=2.0.2&dynamic=true&generic=false&interface=com.manzhizhen.dubbo.api.Dubbo1Service&methods=study&pid=5808&release=2.7.5&revision=1.0.0&service.filter=SystemParamProviderFilter,DLProviderFilter,MetricsProviderFilter&side=provider&threads=10&timestamp=1580090144366&token=true&version=1.0.0]\r\n```\r\n\r\n注意，其中token=true，但其实应该是token=某个UUID，而不是true。\r\nNote that token = true, but it should be token = a UUID instead of true.\r\n\r\n下面是我修改代码后的效果：\r\nHere is the effect after I modify the code:\r\n```\r\n[zk: localhost:2181(CONNECTED) 14] ls /dubbo/com.manzhizhen.dubbo.api.Dubbo1Service/providers\r\n[dubbo%3A%2F%2F192.168.1.6%3A4445%2Fcom.manzhizhen.dubbo.api.Dubbo1Service%3Fanyhost%3Dtrue%26application%3Dmzz-dubbo1%26deprecated%3Dfalse%26dubbo%3D2.0.2%26dynamic%3Dtrue%26generic%3Dfalse%26interface%3Dcom.manzhizhen.dubbo.api.Dubbo1Service%26methods%3Dstudy%26pid%3D13360%26release%3D2.7.5-didi-yzq-2-SNAPSHOT%26revision%3D1.0.0%26service.filter%3DSystemParamProviderFilter%2CDLProviderFilter%2CMetricsProviderFilter%26side%3Dprovider%26threads%3D10%26timestamp%3D1580096635841%26token%3D89b5748a-8016-454d-940c-89d53d78f104%26version%3D1.0.0]\r\n```\r\n这里显示了正确的效果，token=89b5748a-8016-454d-940c-89d53d78f104，一个UUID的值。\r\nThe correct effect is shown here, token = 89b5748a-8016-454d-940c-89d53d78f104, a UUID value.\r\n\r\n这符合之前org.apache.dubbo.config.ServiceConfig中的代码逻辑：\r\nThis is in line with the previous code logic in org.apache.dubbo.config.Serviceconfig:\r\n\r\n```\r\n        if (!ConfigUtils.isEmpty(token)) {\r\n            if (ConfigUtils.isDefault(token)) {\r\n                map.put(TOKEN_KEY, UUID.randomUUID().toString());\r\n            } else {\r\n                map.put(TOKEN_KEY, token);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\n此次PR还修复了dubbo-all中缺失的两个模块依赖问题，所以我们在dubbo-all/pom.xml中添加了遗漏的dubbo-remoting-etcd3和dubbo-registry-eureka模块。\r\nThis PR also fixed two missing module dependencies in Dubbo all, so we added

us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix bug with metadata-type not work since 2.7.5 describe in issue #5667\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n1. Add METADATA_TYPE_KEY in CommonConstants\r\n2. When getting WritableMetadataService, \"metadata-type\" and \"metadata\" are both supported for compatible.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n1. Before this PR, the following config does not work <dubbo:application name=\"demo-provider\" metadata-type=\"remote\"/>\r\n2. After this PR, metadata are published to metadata center.\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-01-23T02:42:59Z","updated_at":"2020-02-01T02:24:59Z","closed_at":"2020-01-31T07:22:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d8fe2427c582630f5555ddc4ec373fc602a05ca5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"tswstarplanet","id":3047563,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNDc1NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3047563?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet","html_url":"https://github.com/tswstarplanet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5695/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5695/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5695/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/0b3a26a15d9702a35f876e03d767ea5541a706a4","head":{"label":"laddcn:master","ref":"master","sha":"0b3a26a15d9702a35f876e03d767ea5541a706a4","user":{"login":"laddcn","id":53557551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNTU3NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53557551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/laddcn","html_url":"https://github.com/laddcn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laddcn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laddcn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laddcn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laddcn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laddcn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laddcn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laddcn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laddcn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laddcn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"e234a8919a85922a99413a77f5eba370d62c665a","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

test/java/org/apache/dubbo/common/extension,the result are all right\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-01-19T06:14:53Z","updated_at":"2021-05-22T07:39:57Z","closed_at":"2021-05-22T07:39:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5448fb5196e4eaf00e3ff337e7cfc07fb2a77a77","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"beiwei30","id":18651996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUxOTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18651996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30","html_url":"https://github.com/beiwei30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":699741254,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTk3NDEyNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/labels/status/waiting-for-feedback","name":"status/waiting-for-feedback","color":"C2E0C6","default":false,"description":"Need

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-01-16T12:38:11Z","updated_at":"2020-01-17T02:48:12Z","closed_at":"2020-01-17T02:48:11Z","merged_at":"2020-01-17T02:48:11Z","merge_commit_sha":"a9a69eac67ded8663fb96e940f07eacc8c0f72b5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/30","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/30","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/30/labels","id":4858697,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNDg1ODY5Nw==","number":30,"title":"2.7.6","description":"Dubbo

If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-01-15T03:03:57Z","updated_at":"2020-02-09T04:56:13Z","closed_at":"2020-02-09T04:56:13Z","merged_at":"2020-02-09T04:56:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"5b4816dfa6ae92d0b94af4ed41c07ca6c9d0fcb9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5651/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5651/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5651/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/52ad007afc24711b36604da5260161cca93beabf","head":{"label":"LiosWong:optimize","ref":"optimize","sha":"52ad007afc24711b36604da5260161cca93beabf","user":{"login":"LiosWong","id":11649603,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjQ5NjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11649603?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong","html_url":"https://github.com/LiosWong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"b288ad7e3812d2354e54aa2f20f8127f24586a5e","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

changelog\r\n\r\nAdd arguments router to ConditionRouter\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAdd arguments router to ConditionRouter\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\nIn some cases, we need to choose the right provider while the arguments of the method is setted.\r\nThe condition rule is like\r\n\r\n> arguments[1].str!=b  => host = 1.1.1.1\r\n\r\nWhile the str property of the second argument is equal to b, the providers whose host is equal to 1.1.1.1 are to be choosed。\r\nWe could use this feature to route requests according to business params. \r\nThe feature is compatible to current ConditionRouter logic.\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-01-14T12:29:48Z","updated_at":"2021-04-11T10:03:15Z","closed_at":"2021-04-11T10:03:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"24423bb9bc13629dbe6c24958b148efeb1127728","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"beiwei30","id":18651996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUxOTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18651996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30","html_url":"https://github.com/beiwei30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":699741254,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTk3NDEyNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/labels/status/waiting-for-feedback","name":"status/waiting-for-feedback","color":"C2E0C6","default":false,"description":"Need

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

[GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

[GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-01-09T02:35:37Z","updated_at":"2020-01-09T02:41:00Z","closed_at":"2020-01-09T02:41:00Z","merged_at":"2020-01-09T02:40:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"f264dac97307abe08992b71caf5912a741c21cd8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5605/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5605/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5605/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/ed8b5c59fc3c864a05387a9c28bbbdae4307d421","head":{"label":"Huangxuny1:master","ref":"master","sha":"ed8b5c59fc3c864a05387a9c28bbbdae4307d421","user":{"login":"Huangxuny1","id":21981606,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTgxNjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21981606?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huangxuny1","html_url":"https://github.com/Huangxuny1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huangxuny1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huangxuny1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huangxuny1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huangxuny1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huangxuny1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huangxuny1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huangxuny1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huangxuny1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Huangxuny1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"2dabc7a841fa10ffa67acad3ef6d40e9b7062ecb","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

[x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-01-07T02:17:03Z","updated_at":"2020-03-21T14:25:23Z","closed_at":"2020-03-21T14:25:23Z","merged_at":"2020-03-21T14:25:23Z","merge_commit_sha":"7a73b3f86a0fbf75f7c190b813dace642bd4a9c7","assignee":{"login":"htynkn","id":659135,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1OTEzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/659135?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn","html_url":"https://github.com/htynkn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"htynkn","id":659135,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1OTEzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/659135?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn","html_url":"https://github.com/htynkn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5593/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5593/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5593/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/a95af2831b942b5db4400c0cbcb549453890c1b8","head":{"label":"huangdx0726:fix5592","ref":"fix5592","sha":"a95af2831b942b5db4400c0cbcb549453890c1b8","user":{"login":"huangdx0726","id":29513837,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NTEzODM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29513837?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangdx0726","html_url":"https://github.com/huangdx0726","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangdx0726/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangdx0726/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangdx0726/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangdx0726/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangdx0726/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangdx0726/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangdx0726/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangdx0726/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangdx0726/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":199995147,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTk5OTUxNDc=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"huangdx0726/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"huangdx0726","id":29513837,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NTEzODM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29513837?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangdx0726","html_url":"https://github.com/huangdx0726","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangdx0726/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangdx0726/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangdx0726/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangdx0726/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangdx0726/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangdx0726/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangdx0726/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangdx0726/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangdx0726/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/huangdx0726/dubbo","description":"Apache

contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-01-05T16:39:12Z","updated_at":"2020-02-09T05:02:17Z","closed_at":"2020-02-09T05:02:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3a7d67ea6800cef72749754b5f03a875b41cffd6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5589/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5589/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5589/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/5e1960547a5c3425f21397a802ec39112d49dfd2","head":{"label":"tswstarplanet:consumer-generic-interface","ref":"consumer-generic-interface","sha":"5e1960547a5c3425f21397a802ec39112d49dfd2","user":{"login":"tswstarplanet","id":3047563,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNDc1NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3047563?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet","html_url":"https://github.com/tswstarplanet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":165711680,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjU3MTE2ODA=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"tswstarplanet/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tswstarplanet","id":3047563,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNDc1NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3047563?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet","html_url":"https://github.com/tswstarplanet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tswstarplanet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tswstarplanet/dubbo","description":"Apache

to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-01-04T16:15:53Z","updated_at":"2020-02-01T08:55:18Z","closed_at":"2020-02-01T05:47:43Z","merged_at":"2020-02-01T05:47:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"36fde9e3e83f38e0d2e8f510c1e69a3aac8c3419","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"beiwei30","id":18651996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUxOTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18651996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30","html_url":"https://github.com/beiwei30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5587/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5587/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5587/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/291f65d9524e782676f5d0851722ddf497161f94","head":{"label":"EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB:patch-15","ref":"patch-15","sha":"291f65d9524e782676f5d0851722ddf497161f94","user":{"login":"EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB","id":37407114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NDA3MTE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37407114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB","html_url":"https://github.com/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":222586459,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjI1ODY0NTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB","id":37407114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NDA3MTE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37407114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB","html_url":"https://github.com/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/events{/privacy}","recei

to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

change\r\n\r\nPassed unit tests\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-01-03T04:56:26Z","updated_at":"2020-02-09T05:14:58Z","closed_at":"2020-02-09T05:14:57Z","merged_at":"2020-02-09T05:14:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"cb7d9f5ca0249636ea6cef96660633329873e2b3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5578/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5578/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5578/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/b689ff6d891c145cbea8176f8d9e94553b3d7646","head":{"label":"EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB:patch-11","ref":"patch-11","sha":"b689ff6d891c145cbea8176f8d9e94553b3d7646","user":{"login":"EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB","id":37407114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NDA3MTE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37407114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB","html_url":"https://github.com/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":222586459,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjI1ODY0NTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB","id":37407114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NDA3MTE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37407114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB","html_url":"https://github.com/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n``defaultProtocol`` won't be empty, because of

changelog\r\n\r\n``org.apache.dubbo.common.utils.UrlUtils``\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-01-03T03:16:32Z","updated_at":"2020-02-09T05:14:41Z","closed_at":"2020-02-09T05:14:41Z","merged_at":"2020-02-09T05:14:41Z","merge_commit_sha":"74e2d6814a77a89ae46539310db3ca2792b6d427","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5577/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5577/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5577/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/8950951b77add624df2715cda643bf40800eed85","head":{"label":"GungnirLaevatain:polish","ref":"polish","sha":"8950951b77add624df2715cda643bf40800eed85","user":{"login":"GungnirLaevatain","id":18031800,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDMxODAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18031800?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GungnirLaevatain","html_url":"https://github.com/GungnirLaevatain","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GungnirLaevatain/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GungnirLaevatain/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GungnirLaevatain/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GungnirLaevatain/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GungnirLaevatain/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GungnirLaevatain/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GungnirLaevatain/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GungnirLaevatain/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GungnirLaevatain/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":227025449,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjcwMjU0NDk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"GungnirLaevatain/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"GungnirLaevatain","id":18031800,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDMxODAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18031800?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GungnirLaevatain","html_url":"https://github.com/GungnirLaevatain","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GungnirLaevatain/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GungnirLaevatain/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GungnirLaevatain/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GungnirLaevatain/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GungnirLaevatain/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GungnirLaevatain/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GungnirLaevatain/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GungnirLaevatain/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GungnirLaevatain/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/GungnirLaevatain/dubbo","description":"Apache

unit tests\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-01-02T01:41:57Z","updated_at":"2020-02-09T08:38:24Z","closed_at":"2020-02-09T05:20:12Z","merged_at":"2020-02-09T05:20:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"f4d97c5ae99f30999a5537758312fe1b03971e67","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5575/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5575/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5575/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/4c33791b9192260f06c934e13ba72849a93f3453","head":{"label":"EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB:patch-9","ref":"patch-9","sha":"4c33791b9192260f06c934e13ba72849a93f3453","user":{"login":"EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB","id":37407114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NDA3MTE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37407114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB","html_url":"https://github.com/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":222586459,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjI1ODY0NTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB","id":37407114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NDA3MTE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37407114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB","html_url":"https://github.com/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/dubbo","description":"Apache

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-01-02T01:00:13Z","updated_at":"2021-03-14T09:22:09Z","closed_at":"2021-03-14T09:22:08Z","merged_at":"2021-03-14T09:22:08Z","merge_commit_sha":"279699f39f6203dfad4921783e866a8cb1a7fdcf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5574/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5574/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5574/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/16115c8ee3175a12716c218ed3d7073680f47361","head":{"label":"EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB:patch-7","ref":"patch-7","sha":"16115c8ee3175a12716c218ed3d7073680f47361","user":{"login":"EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB","id":37407114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NDA3MTE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37407114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB","html_url":"https://github.com/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":222586459,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjI1ODY0NTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB","id":37407114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NDA3MTE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37407114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB","html_url":"https://github.com/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/dubbo","description":"Apache

to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-01-01T07:13:05Z","updated_at":"2020-02-09T05:42:02Z","closed_at":"2020-02-09T05:42:02Z","merged_at":"2020-02-09T05:42:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"cf0af06c9df7bc00fd0b57641b0d1130c34528de","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5573/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5573/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5573/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/98f007520e5436ac417cafce46ba6d02034632c9","head":{"label":"EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB:patch-6","ref":"patch-6","sha":"98f007520e5436ac417cafce46ba6d02034632c9","user":{"login":"EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB","id":37407114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NDA3MTE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37407114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB","html_url":"https://github.com/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":222586459,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjI1ODY0NTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB","id":37407114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NDA3MTE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37407114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB","html_url":"https://github.com/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/dubbo","description":"Apache

change\r\n\r\nPassed unit test\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-01-01T06:46:29Z","updated_at":"2020-02-01T08:56:53Z","closed_at":"2020-02-01T07:37:59Z","merged_at":"2020-02-01T07:37:58Z","merge_commit_sha":"5e85623c976102d79ab8253350f882a3d053c562","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5572/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5572/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5572/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/9200d0ad1e43ff3b5928119e48d62e929384f1dc","head":{"label":"EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB:patch-5","ref":"patch-5","sha":"9200d0ad1e43ff3b5928119e48d62e929384f1dc","user":{"login":"EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB","id":37407114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NDA3MTE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37407114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB","html_url":"https://github.com/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":222586459,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjI1ODY0NTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB","id":37407114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NDA3MTE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37407114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB","html_url":"https://github.com/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/dubbo","description":"Apache

easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-31T11:06:32Z","updated_at":"2020-09-10T01:54:21Z","closed_at":"2020-09-10T01:54:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ebfb62ed6f12e1cf0d45c6b6554ee0f849d436e1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5571/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5571/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5571/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/b0c06e769bd70f1d0bebaf516466bb57c1eceb43","head":{"label":"LiosWong:code_optimization","ref":"code_optimization","sha":"b0c06e769bd70f1d0bebaf516466bb57c1eceb43","user":{"login":"LiosWong","id":11649603,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjQ5NjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11649603?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong","html_url":"https://github.com/LiosWong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiosWong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"16f1fad340a88571f85c26b3f028f30c2d5ad62e","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-31T07:05:49Z","updated_at":"2021-05-22T07:43:01Z","closed_at":"2021-05-22T07:43:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bb57c350a0630c87f095dfd68446b982e0ec6c25","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":699741254,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTk3NDEyNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/labels/status/waiting-for-feedback","name":"status/waiting-for-feedback","color":"C2E0C6","default":false,"description":"Need

this change\r\n\r\nPassed unit tests\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-31T06:30:15Z","updated_at":"2019-12-31T08:10:32Z","closed_at":"2019-12-31T08:08:48Z","merged_at":"2019-12-31T08:08:48Z","merge_commit_sha":"16f1fad340a88571f85c26b3f028f30c2d5ad62e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5567/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5567/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5567/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/15779f70faf2c1d7a6c6a47dc0bfecaeccd74186","head":{"label":"EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB:patch-4","ref":"patch-4","sha":"15779f70faf2c1d7a6c6a47dc0bfecaeccd74186","user":{"login":"EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB","id":37407114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NDA3MTE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37407114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB","html_url":"https://github.com/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":222586459,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjI1ODY0NTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB","id":37407114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NDA3MTE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37407114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB","html_url":"https://github.com/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/EZKAYOTWJPRKXWCUYEEB/dubbo","description":"Apache

Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPassed unit tests\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nTool classes should avoid creating new objects and causing waste of resources. To avoid developers using improper methods, add private constructors.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n1.dubbo-common/src/main/java/org/apache/dubbo/common/utils/MethodUtils.java\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPassed unit tests\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-30T11:51:27Z","updated_at":"2020-01-02T10:58:25Z","closed_at":"2020-01-02T10:58:25Z","merged_at":"2020-01-02T10:58:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"268b09269492561991e7104de00a53b41d7ffbd0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5558/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5558/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5558/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/64a4778eeb36ccaf44743b94105b80823da384da","head":{"label":"zhenxianyimeng:zhenxianyimeng_stringutils","ref":"zhenxianyimeng_stringutils","sha":"64a4778eeb36ccaf44743b94105b80823da384da","user":{"login":"zhenxianyimeng","id":15272909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjcyOTA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15272909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenxianyimeng","html_url":"https://github.com/zhenxianyimeng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenxianyimeng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenxianyimeng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenxianyimeng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenxianyimeng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenxianyimeng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenxianyimeng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenxianyimeng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenxianyimeng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenxianyimeng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":193426363,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTM0MjYzNjM=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"zhenxianyimeng/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zhenxianyimeng","id":15272909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjcyOTA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15272909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenxianyimeng","html_url":"https://github.com/zhenxianyimeng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenxianyimeng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenxianyimeng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenxianyimeng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenxianyimeng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenxianyimeng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenxianyimeng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenxianyimeng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenxianyimeng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenxianyimeng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zhenxianyimeng/dubbo","description":"Apache

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues/5554) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-30T05:35:08Z","updated_at":"2019-12-30T09:32:02Z","closed_at":"2019-12-30T09:32:02Z","merged_at":"2019-12-30T09:32:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"1aed3aea92c093fb55db81f99622a9f925b07939","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5556/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5556/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5556/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/d3af608ea19dcdf65ade03f26f98700095cfbd36","head":{"label":"mayankkt9:Issue-5554","ref":"Issue-5554","sha":"d3af608ea19dcdf65ade03f26f98700095cfbd36","user":{"login":"mayankkt9","id":37381526,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MzgxNTI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37381526?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankkt9","html_url":"https://github.com/mayankkt9","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankkt9/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankkt9/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankkt9/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankkt9/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankkt9/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankkt9/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankkt9/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankkt9/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankkt9/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":230849112,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzA4NDkxMTI=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"mayankkt9/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mayankkt9","id":37381526,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MzgxNTI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37381526?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankkt9","html_url":"https://github.com/mayankkt9","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankkt9/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankkt9/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankkt9/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankkt9/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankkt9/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankkt9/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankkt9/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankkt9/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mayankkt9/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mayankkt9/dubbo","description":"Apache

contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-30T02:58:32Z","updated_at":"2020-01-03T03:02:53Z","closed_at":"2020-01-03T01:32:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4f773458bf792a183754e6b756e418f176166086","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":699742270,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTk3NDIyNzA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/labels/type/need-triage","name":"type/need-triage","color":"C5DEF5","default":false,"description":"Need

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nWe use `@Autowired` or `@Reference` to inject ReferenceBean<T>, and the ReferenceBean will init while the project is starting. The startup processor may process too long time. And In the local development environment, we may just modify few logics, but we must wait maybe a long time to restart, dubbo should provide `lazy init ReferenceBean util actually use not just in injection`.\r\n\r\nThus, if we set `dubbo.consumer.trueinit=false`, it will cost more time in the first use of one ReferenceBean, but I think it's ok in the development enviroment.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-29T14:52:59Z","updated_at":"2021-05-22T07:39:44Z","closed_at":"2021-05-22T07:39:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d4d063d6e8745233b09b7cdcfcc22adbe4ab85a2","assignee":{"login":"mercyblitz","id":533114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMzExNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/533114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz","html_url":"https://github.com/mercyblitz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"mercyblitz","id":533114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMzExNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/533114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz","html_url":"https://github.com/mercyblitz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"mercyblitz","id":533114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMzExNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/533114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz","html_url":"https://github.com/mercyblitz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"beiwei30","id":18651996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUxOTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18651996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30","html_url":"https://github.com/beiwei30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/received_events","type":"U

a function:check if consumer reference new service methods is not registered in the registry when the consumer starts\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\nThis situation occurs during actual use. In the SDK used this time, there is an additional method under the same service, but it was not noticed during the online process. When the method is actually called, an error occurs. \r\n1、When the consumer starts, it can not only detect the existence of the provider, but also whether the provider's methods meet the current use of the server\r\n2、Check whether the check is configured or not, the difference is that if check is true, the program will be interrupted\r\n## Brief changelog\r\nAdded a new method to compare the method used when the consumer is started with the existing method on the registry\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nUse dubbo-demo-annotation test case.\r\nVerification method: At present, there are two services in this  case. First delete one service and then start the provider. When the deleted service is restored, and the consumer is started, it will find that the consumer starts to report an error.\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-27T20:22:54Z","updated_at":"2020-06-29T02:19:02Z","closed_at":"2020-06-29T02:19:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2b1c7de68f2e8a74f4a40363040164e00bd755f2","assignee":{"login":"cvictory","id":4089452,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwODk0NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4089452?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory","html_url":"https://github.com/cvictory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"cvictory","id":4089452,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwODk0NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4089452?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory","html_url":"https://github.com/cvictory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"htynkn","id":659135,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1OTEzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/659135?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn","html_url":"https://github.com/htynkn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"cvictory","id":4089452,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwODk0NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4089452?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory","html_url":"https://github.com/cvictory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cvictory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"mileston

If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-27T14:21:27Z","updated_at":"2019-12-29T12:12:31Z","closed_at":"2019-12-29T12:12:21Z","merged_at":"2019-12-29T12:12:21Z","merge_commit_sha":"eeca7c947dff6392fa8057836333d3ba719747e9","assignee":{"login":"htynkn","id":659135,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1OTEzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/659135?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn","html_url":"https://github.com/htynkn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"htynkn","id":659135,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1OTEzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/659135?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn","html_url":"https://github.com/htynkn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htynkn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5548/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5548/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5548/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/394608be44f7071590405094678a7ca7bf96d723","head":{"label":"shtke:delete-unused-variable","ref":"delete-unused-variable","sha":"394608be44f7071590405094678a7ca7bf96d723","user":{"login":"shtke","id":12456819,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDU2ODE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12456819?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shtke","html_url":"https://github.com/shtke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shtke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shtke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shtke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shtke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shtke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shtke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shtke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shtke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shtke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":230449507,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzA0NDk1MDc=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"shtke/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"shtke","id":12456819,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDU2ODE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12456819?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shtke","html_url":"https://github.com/shtke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shtke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shtke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shtke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shtke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shtke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shtke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shtke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shtke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shtke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/shtke/dubbo","description":"Apache

easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install

`Map$Node[]` allocation in `ContextFilter`.\r\n* Reduce `RpcContext.getContext()` invoke times in `ContextFilter`.\r\n* Use `host.startWith(\"127.\")` instead of `LOCAL_IP_PATTERN.matcher(host).matches()` in `NetUtils.isInvalidLocalHost(String)`.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue.

[GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-24T02:26:56Z","updated_at":"2019-12-24T07:30:45Z","closed_at":"2019-12-24T02:38:11Z","merged_at":"2019-12-24T02:38:11Z","merge_commit_sha":"8acd17cf43a17d2a8df1ca01b11d25763de734a1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5530/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5530/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5530/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/fdfedf8e7efdcb30b6b067751725f6e70f10972d","head":{"label":"lovepoem:add_dubbo_awesome_in_README","ref":"add_dubbo_awesome_in_README","sha":"fdfedf8e7efdcb30b6b067751725f6e70f10972d","user":{"login":"lovepoem","id":827112,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNzExMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/827112?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovepoem","html_url":"https://github.com/lovepoem","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovepoem/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovepoem/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovepoem/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovepoem/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovepoem/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovepoem/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovepoem/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovepoem/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovepoem/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":188452349,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODg0NTIzNDk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"lovepoem/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lovepoem","id":827112,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNzExMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/827112?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovepoem","html_url":"https://github.com/lovepoem","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovepoem/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovepoem/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovepoem/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovepoem/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovepoem/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovepoem/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovepoem/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovepoem/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovepoem/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lovepoem/dubbo","description":"Apache

found a refactoring opportunity on Dubbo project.\r\nI believe the online method of the Online class can be improved. This method calls 8 other methods from other classes.\r\n\r\nBesides that, the online method calls many times ProviderModel.RegisterStatedURL inner class. In my view, a part of the online method should be extracted to a new method, and this new method should be moved to RegisterStatedURL. What do you think?\r\n\r\nThe same logic is applied to the offline method.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of theses changes are:\r\nRemove a feature envy (this method has 4 calls to the

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-22T15:24:32Z","updated_at":"2019-12-25T07:22:57Z","closed_at":"2019-12-25T07:22:57Z","merged_at":"2019-12-25T07:22:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"fa157deadf65d00c9884d611430ec78e585840ff","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5526/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/5526/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/5526/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/3927bf441c9103d151a1c7b3f9503b456dbfacf6","head":{"label":"LinShunKang:clean/remove_duplicate_method","ref":"clean/remove_duplicate_method","sha":"3927bf441c9103d151a1c7b3f9503b456dbfacf6","user":{"login":"LinShunKang","id":7189879,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxODk4Nzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7189879?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang","html_url":"https://github.com/LinShunKang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":222932918,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjI5MzI5MTg=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"LinShunKang/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"LinShunKang","id":7189879,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxODk4Nzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7189879?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang","html_url":"https://github.com/LinShunKang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinShunKang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/LinShunKang/dubbo","description":"Apache

String, String)`.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ x Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-22T15:07:40Z","updated_at":"2020-02-04T05:39:49Z","closed_at":"2020-02-04T05:39:49Z","merged_at":"2020-02-04T05:39:49Z","merge_commit_sha":"c0d62ed7a83347fa469c2b2a7d75287a5feb799b","assignee":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/30","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/30","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/30/labels","id":4858697,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNDg1ODY5Nw==","number":30,"title":"2.7.6","description":"Dubbo
