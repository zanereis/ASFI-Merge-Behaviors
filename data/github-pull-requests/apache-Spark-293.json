What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nRefactor ColumnStat to be more flexible.\r\n\r\n* Split `ColumnStat` and `CatalogColumnStat` just like `CatalogStatistics` is split from `Statistics`. This detaches how the statistics are stored from how they are processed in the query plan. `CatalogColumnStat` keeps `min` and `max` as `String`, making it not depend on dataType information.\r\n* For `CatalogColumnStat`, parse column names from property names in the metastore (`KEY_VERSION` property), not from metastore schema. This means that `CatalogColumnStat`s can be created for columns even if the schema itself is not stored in the metastore.\r\n* Make all fields optional. `min`, `max` and `histogram` for columns were optional already. Having them all optional is more consistent, and gives flexibility to e.g. drop some of the fields through transformations if they are difficult / impossible to calculate.\r\n\r\nThe added flexibility will make it possible to have alternative implementations for stats, and separates stats collection from stats and estimation processing in plans.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nRefactored existing tests to work with refactored `ColumnStat` and `CatalogColumnStat`.\r\nNew tests added in `StatisticsSuite` checking that backwards / forwards compatibility is not

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nBefore the patch, Spark could infer as Date a partition value which cannot be casted to Date (this can happen when there are extra characters after a valid date, like `2018-02-15AAA`).\r\n\r\nWhen this happens and the input format has metadata which define the schema of the table, then `null` is returned as a value for the partition column, because the `cast` operator used in (`PartitioningAwareFileIndex.inferPartitioning`) is unable to convert the value.\r\n\r\nThe PR checks in the partition inference that values can be casted to Date and Timestamp, in order to infer that datatype to them.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nadded

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThere is a race condition introduced in SPARK-11141 which could cause data loss.\r\nThe problem is that ReceivedBlockTracker.insertAllocatedBatch function assumes that all blocks from streamIdToUnallocatedBlockQueues allocated to the batch and clears the queue.\r\n\r\nIn this PR only the allocated blocks will be removed from the queue which will prevent data loss.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdditional unit test +

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn a kerberized cluster, when Spark reads a file path (e.g. `people.json`), it warns with a wrong warning message during looking up `people.json/_spark_metadata`. The root cause of this situation is the difference between `LocalFileSystem` and `DistributedFileSystem`. `LocalFileSystem.exists()` returns `false`, but `DistributedFileSystem.exists` raises `org.apache.hadoop.security.AccessControlException`.\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nscala> spark.version\r\nres0: String = 2.4.0-SNAPSHOT\r\n\r\nscala>

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n1. Add \"project\" methods for both Partitioning and Ordering (Seq[SortOrder]), which returns what should be the partitioning or ordering after the projection, i.e., substitutes the projected expressions with aliases specified in the project.\r\n\r\n2. In ProjectExec, XXXAggregateExec, make outputPartitioning and outputOrdering return \"child.outputPartitioning.project(projectList)\" or \"SortOrder.projectOrderings(child.outputOrdering, projectList)\" instead of \"child.outputPartitioning\" or \"child.outputOrdering\".\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n1. Add 2 tests in SQLQuerySuite to verify that the unnecessary Exchange and/or Sort have been eliminated from the execution plan.\r\n2. Add 1 unit test in DistributionSuite.\r\n\r\n## Note\r\nNote that there could be some variation in the implementation of \"Partitioning.project(projectList)\", depending on whether or not we'd choose to retain the original partitioning together with the projected partitioning, and how far we'd go to include all possible valid partitionings.\r\nSince it is usually impossible to refer to the original expression once it is projected with an alias, unless it appears elsewhere in the projection list (without alias or with a different alias). This would lead to the implementation being more complex and generating a cartesian product of all substituted/unsubstituted expressions if 1) a partitioning contains more than one expression; 2) a partitioning contains expressions that consist of more than one projected expression.\r\nThat said, I consider \"an expression being projected twice in one projection\" to be a rare case which does not make much sense, so the current implementation should be good enough.\r\n","created_at":"2018-02-14T22:20:13Z","updated_at":"2018-05-01T00:28:32Z","closed_at":"2018-05-01T00:28:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cf58d65a55c706e03ced49fd3b3341095c3959ef","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20613/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20613/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/20613/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/27a1af22e94f49b7801c4f49443ebadb1ff35571","head":{"label":"maryannxue:spark-23368","ref":"spark-23368","sha":"27a1af22e94f49b7801c4f49443ebadb1ff35571","user":{"login":"maryannxue","id":4171904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNzE5MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4171904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue","html_url":"https://github.com/maryannxue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":104110775,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDQxMTA3NzU=","name":"spark","full_name":"maryannxue/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"maryannxue","id":4171904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNzE5MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4171904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue","html_url":"https://github.com/maryannxue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/maryannxue/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n**Problem statement**\r\nload data command  with hdfs  file paths consists of  wild card strings like * are not working\r\neg:\r\n\"load data inpath 'hdfs://hacluster/user/ext*  into table t1\"\r\nthrows Analysis exception while executing this query\r\n\r\n![wildcard_issue](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12999161/42673744-9f5c0c16-8621-11e8-8d28-cdc41bbe6efe.PNG)\r\n\r\n**Analysis -** \r\nCurrently fs.exists() API which is used for path validation in load command API cannot resolve the path with wild card pattern, To mitigate this problem i am using globStatus() API  another api  which can resolve the paths with hdfs supported wildcards like *,? etc(inline with hive wildcard support).\r\n\r\n**Improvement identified as part of this issue -**\r\nCurrently system wont support wildcard character to be used for folder level path in a local file system.  This PR has handled this scenario, the same globStatus API will unify the validation logic of local and non local file systems, this will ensure the behavior consistency between the hdfs and local file path in  load command.\r\n\r\nwith this improvement user will be able to use a wildcard character in folder level path of a local file system in  load command inline with hive behaviour, in older versions user can use wildcards only in file path of the local file system if they use in folder path system use to give an error by mentioning that not supported.\r\neg: load data local  inpath '/localfilesystem/folder*  into table t1\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\na) Manually tested by executing test-cases in HDFS yarn cluster.  Reports is been attached in below section.\r\nb) Existing test-case can verify the impact and functionality  for local file path scenarios\r\nc) A test-case is been added for verifying the functionality when wild card is been used in folder level path of a local file system\r\n## Test Results\r\nNote: all ip's were updated to localhost for security reasons.\r\nHDFS path

PR sets `\"spark.cleaner.referenceTracking.blocking\"` to `false` by\r\ndefault. It had originally been set to `true` as a workaround for\r\nSPARK-3015.\r\n\r\nHowever, that issue has been resolved since 16/Aug/2014 already.\r\nI would therefore think that it's safe to make this non-blocking by\r\ndefault, which should help with cases where the cleanup thread can not\r\nkeep up any more.\r\n\r\nIf there are other reasons why this should stay blocking by default, I'd\r\nbe interested to learn about them. In that case the comment should\r\nprobably be

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nDataSourceV2 initially allowed user-supplied schemas when a source doesn't implement `ReadSupportWithSchema`, as long as the schema was identical to the source's schema. This is confusing behavior because changes to an underlying table can cause a previously working job to fail with an exception that user-supplied schemas are not allowed.\r\n\r\nThis reverts commit adcb25a0624, which was added to #20387 so that it could be removed in a separate JIRA issue and PR.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nStreamExecution.isInterruptedByStop() implements a whitelist of exceptions which indicate a benign stop() call. The DataSourceV2 write path introduces a new kind of exception, SparkException caused by InterruptedException, which must be added to this whitelist. (This exception comes from an interrupt in ThreadUtils.awaitResult().)\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting unit tests. Unfortunately, the underlying flakiness is reasonably rare, so I don't have a good idea for how to test that this resolves it.\r\n","created_at":"2018-02-13T19:52:57Z","updated_at":"2018-02-14T02:04:59Z","closed_at":"2018-02-13T20:58:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"59efffc2e66f197d0fc8c99d8e859861048d9dc4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20602/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20602/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/20602/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f6200837f30570edc2dc3145e8651d1f238c8e9b","head":{"label":"jose-torres:SPARK-23416","ref":"SPARK-23416","sha":"f6200837f30570edc2dc3145e8651d1f238c8e9b","user":{"login":"jose-torres","id":30604243,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNjA0MjQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30604243?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jose-torres","html_url":"https://github.com/jose-torres","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jose-torres/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jose-torres/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jose-torres/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jose-torres/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jose-torres/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jose-torres/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jose-torres/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jose-torres/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jose-torres/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":98938104,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5ODkzODEwNA==","name":"spark","full_name":"jose-torres/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jose-torres","id":30604243,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNjA0MjQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30604243?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jose-torres","html_url":"https://github.com/jose-torres","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jose-torres/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jose-torres/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jose-torres/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jose-torres/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jose-torres/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jose-torres/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jose-torres/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jose-torres/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jose-torres/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jose-torres/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/19811 .\r\n\r\nIn #19811, we picked a sub-optimal solution that always compact non-primitive mutable states to arrays, to make primitive mutable states more likely to get inlined.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new config to not treat primitive states specially and try to inline all states, to avoid any potential perf regression in Spark 2.3. By default it's false.\r\n\r\nIn the future, we can remove this config, and dynamically decide which states to inline.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSolved two bugs to enable stream-stream self joins. \r\n\r\n### Incorrect analysis due to missing MultiInstanceRelation trait\r\nStreaming leaf nodes did not extend MultiInstanceRelation, which is necessary for the catalyst analyzer to convert the self-join logical plan DAG into a tree (by creating new instances of the leaf relations). This was causing the error `Failure when resolving conflicting references in Join:` (see JIRA for details).\r\n\r\n### Incorrect attribute rewrite when splicing batch plans in MicroBatchExecution\r\nWhen splicing the source's batch plan into the streaming plan (by replacing the StreamingExecutionPlan), we were rewriting the attribute reference in the streaming plan with the new attribute references from the batch plan. This was incorrectly handling the scenario when multiple StreamingExecutionRelation point to the same source, and therefore eventually point to the same batch plan returned by the source. Here is an example query, and its corresponding plan transformations.\r\n```\r\nval df = input.toDF\r\nval join =\r\n      df.select('value % 5 as \"key\", 'value).join(\r\n        df.select('value % 5 as \"key\", 'value), \"key\")\r\n```\r\nStreaming logical plan before splicing the batch plan\r\n```\r\nProject [key#6, value#1, value#12]\r\n+- Join Inner, (key#6 = key#9)\r\n   :- Project [(value#1 % 5) AS key#6, value#1]\r\n   :  +- StreamingExecutionRelation Memory[#1], value#1\r\n   +- Project [(value#12 % 5) AS key#9, value#12]\r\n      +- StreamingExecutionRelation Memory[#1], value#12  // two different leaves pointing to same source\r\n```\r\nBatch logical plan after splicing the batch plan and before rewriting\r\n```\r\nProject [key#6, value#1, value#12]\r\n+- Join Inner, (key#6 = key#9)\r\n   :- Project [(value#1 % 5) AS key#6, value#1]\r\n   :  +- LocalRelation [value#66]           // replaces StreamingExecutionRelation Memory[#1], value#1\r\n   +- Project [(value#12 % 5) AS key#9, value#12]\r\n      +- LocalRelation [value#66]           // replaces StreamingExecutionRelation Memory[#1], value#12\r\n```\r\nBatch logical plan after rewriting the attributes. Specifically, for spliced, the new output attributes (value#66) replace the earlier output attributes (value#12, and value#1, one for each StreamingExecutionRelation).\r\n```\r\nProject [key#6, value#66, value#66]       // both value#1 and value#12 replaces by value#66\r\n+- Join Inner, (key#6 = key#9)\r\n   :- Project [(value#66 % 5) AS key#6, value#66]\r\n   :  +- LocalRelation [value#66]\r\n   +- Project [(value#66 % 5) AS key#9, value#66]\r\n      +- LocalRelation [value#66]\r\n```\r\nThis causes the optimizer to eliminate value#66 from one side of the join.\r\n```\r\nProject [key#6, value#66, value#66]\r\n+- Join Inner, (key#6 = key#9)\r\n   :- Project [(value#66 % 5) AS key#6, value#66]\r\n   :  +- LocalRelation [value#66]\r\n   +- Project [(value#66 % 5) AS key#9]   // this does not generate value, incorrect join results\r\n      +- LocalRelation [value#66]\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Solution**: Instead of rewriting attributes, use a Project to introduce aliases between the output attribute references and the new reference generated by the spliced plans. The analyzer and optimizer will take care of the rest.\r\n```\r\nProject [key#6, value#1, value#12]\r\n+- Join Inner, (key#6 = key#9)\r\n   :- Project [(value#1 % 5) AS key#6, value#1]\r\n   :  +- Project [value#66 AS value#1]   // solution: project with aliases\r\n   :     +- LocalRelation [value#66]\r\n   +- Project [(value#12 % 5) AS key#9, value#12]\r\n      +- Project [value#66 AS value#12]    // solution: project with aliases\r\n         +- LocalRelation [value#66]\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nNew unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n#### Problem:\r\n\r\nSince 2.3, `Bucketizer` supports multiple input/output columns. We will check if exclusive params are set during transformation. E.g., if `inputCols` and `outputCol` are both set, an error will be thrown.\r\n\r\nHowever, when we write `Bucketizer`, looks like the default params and user-supplied params are merged during writing. All saved params are loaded back and set to created model instance. So the default `outputCol` param in `HasOutputCol` trait will be set in `paramMap` and become an user-supplied param. That makes the check of exclusive params failed.\r\n\r\n#### Fix:\r\n\r\nThis changes the saving logic of Bucketizer to handle this case. This is a quick fix to catch the time of 2.3. We should consider modify the persistence mechanism later.\r\n\r\nPlease see the discussion in the JIRA.\r\n\r\nNote: The multi-column `QuantileDiscretizer` also has the same issue.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nModified tests.","created_at":"2018-02-13T05:08:06Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:21:25Z","closed_at":"2018-02-15T17:57:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c092c2cc9906b8b32fb45fd0c32961bb75714f59","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20594/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20594/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/20594/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/174c1148e595b5eda731dbdae2c6fbf1a4dd4837","head":{"label":"viirya:SPARK-23377-2","ref":"SPARK-23377-2","sha":"174c1148e595b5eda731dbdae2c6fbf1a4dd4837","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn this upcoming 2.3 release, we changed the interface of `ScalaUDF`. Unfortunately, some Spark packages (e.g., spark-deep-learning) are using our internal class `ScalaUDF`. In the release 2.3, we added new parameters into this class. The users hit the binary compatibility issues and got the exception:\r\n\r\n```\r\n> java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.ScalaUDF.&lt;init&gt;(Ljava/lang/Object;Lorg/apache/spark/sql/types/DataType;Lscala/collection/Seq;Lscala/collection/Seq;Lscala/Option;)V\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR is to improve the backward compatibility. However, we definitely should not encourage the external packages to use our internal classes. This might make us hard to maintain/develop the codes in Spark.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nN/A","created_at":"2018-02-12T22:20:00Z","updated_at":"2018-02-13T20:00:15Z","closed_at":"2018-02-13T20:00:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e98f48b72b6aac796f8f6fabf49ca499bce83d94","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20591/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20591/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/20591/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/08b39d093d16b8e803557eba6b525a35b0f13f75","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:scalaUDF","ref":"scalaUDF","sha":"08b39d093d16b8e803557eba6b525a35b0f13f75","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to resolve an open file leakage issue reported at [SPARK-23390](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-23390) by moving the listener registration position. Currently, the sequence is like the following.\r\n\r\n1. Create `batchReader`\r\n2. `batchReader.initialize` opens a ORC file.\r\n3. `batchReader.initBatch` may take a long time to alloc memory in some environment and cause errors.\r\n4. `Option(TaskContext.get()).foreach(_.addTaskCompletionListener(_ => iter.close()))`\r\n\r\nThis PR moves 4 before 2 and 3. To sum up, the new sequence is 1 -> 4 -> 2 -> 3.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual. The following test case makes OOM intentionally to cause leaked filesystem connection in the current code base. With this patch, leakage doesn't occurs.\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n  // This should be tested manually because it raises OOM intentionally\r\n  // in order to cause `Leaked filesystem connection`.\r\n

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR backports https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/20531:\r\n\r\nIt explicitly specifies supported types in Pandas UDFs.\r\nThe main change here is to add a deduplicated and explicit type checking in `returnType` ahead with documenting this; however, it happened to fix multiple things.\r\n\r\n1. Currently, we don't support `BinaryType` in Pandas UDFs, for example, see:\r\n\r\n    ```python\r\n    from pyspark.sql.functions import pandas_udf\r\n    pudf = pandas_udf(lambda x: x, \"binary\")\r\n    df = spark.createDataFrame([[bytearray(1)]])\r\n    df.select(pudf(\"_1\")).show()\r\n    ```\r\n    ```\r\n    ...\r\n    TypeError: Unsupported type in conversion to Arrow: BinaryType\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    We can document this behaviour for its guide.\r\n\r\n2. Since we can check the return type ahead, we can fail fast before actual execution.\r\n\r\n    ```python\r\n    # we can fail fast at this stage because we know the schema ahead\r\n    pandas_udf(lambda x: x, BinaryType())\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested and unit tests for `BinaryType` and `ArrayType(...)` were

ORC intentionally allow empty files, and the reader fails during reading without closing the file stream.\r\n\r\nThis PR improves the test to make sure all files are deleted and can't be

and loaded when creating SparkUI\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if there was a mechanism to allow to add customized SparkUITab (embedded like Jobs, Stages, Storage, Environment, Executors,...) to be registered through SparkConf settings. This would be more flexible when we need display some special information in UI rather than adding the embedded one by one and wait community to merge.\r\n\r\nI propose to introduce a new configuration option, spark.extraUITabs, that allows customized SparkUITab to be specified in SparkConf and registered when SparkUI is created. Here is the proposed documentation for the new option: \r\n\r\n> A comma-separated list of classes that implement SparkUITab; when initializing SparkUI, instances of these classes will be created and registered to the tabs array in SparkUI. If a class has a two-argument constructor that accepts a SparkUI and AppStatusStore, that constructor will be called; If a class has a single-argument constructor that accepts a SparkUI; otherwise, a zero-argument constructor will be called. If no valid constructor can be found, the SparkUI creation will fail with an exception.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n1.  Offerred a unit test.\r\n2. Check the WebUI to see a new tab called \"Test\" via\r\n> bin/spark-shell` --master local --driver-class-path /path/spark-core_2.11-*-tests.jar --conf spark.extraUITabs=org.apache.spark.ui.TestUITab

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to fallback to non-Arrow optimization if possible - for unsupported schema, PyArrow version mismatch and PyAarrow

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSince 2.3, `Bucketizer` supports multiple input/output columns. We will check if exclusive params are set during transformation. E.g., if `inputCols` and `outputCol` are both set, an error will be thrown.\r\n\r\nHowever, when we write `Bucketizer`, looks like the default params and user-supplied params are merged during writing. All saved params are loaded back and set to created model instance. So the default `outputCol` param in `HasOutputCol` trait will be set in `paramMap` and become an user-supplied param.

`UnsafeKVExternalSorter` with `BytesToBytesMap`, we need to create a `UnsafeInMemorySorter` to sort the data in `BytesToBytesMap`. The data format of the sorter and the map is same, so no data movement is required. However, both the sorter and the map need a point array for some bookkeeping work.\r\n\r\nThere is an optimization in `UnsafeKVExternalSorter`: reuse the point array between the sorter and the map, to avoid an extra memory allocation. This sounds like a reasonable optimization, the length of the `BytesToBytesMap` point array is at least 4 times larger than the number of keys(to avoid hash collision, the hash table size should be at least 2 times larger than the number of keys, and each key occupies 2 slots). `UnsafeInMemorySorter` needs the pointer array size to be 4 times of the number of entries, so we are safe to reuse the point array.\r\n\r\nHowever, the number of keys of the map doesn't equal to the number of entries in the map, because `BytesToBytesMap` supports duplicated keys. This breaks the assumption of the above optimization and we may run out of space when inserting data into the sorter, and hit error\r\n```\r\njava.lang.IllegalStateException: There is no space for new

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\n`ReadAheadInputStream` was introduced in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/18317/ to optimize reading spill files from disk.\nHowever, from the profiles it seems that the hot path of reading small amounts of data (like readInt) is inefficient - it involves taking locks, and multiple checks.\n\nOptimize locking: Lock is not needed when simply accessing the active buffer. Only lock when needing to swap buffers or trigger async reading, or get information about the async state.\n\nOptimize short-path single byte reads, that are used e.g. by Java library DataInputStream.readInt.\n\nThe asyncReader used to call \"read\" only once on the underlying stream, that never filled the underlying buffer when it was wrapping an LZ4BlockInputStream. If the buffer was returned unfilled, that would trigger the async reader to be triggered to fill the read ahead buffer on each call, because the reader would see that the active buffer is below the refill threshold all the time.\n\nHowever, filling the full buffer all the time could introduce increased latency, so also add an `AtomicBoolean` flag for the async reader to return earlier if there is a reader waiting for data.\n\nRemove `readAheadThresholdInBytes` and instead immediately trigger async read when switching the buffers. It allows to simplify code paths, especially the hot one that then only has to check if there is available data in the active buffer, without worrying if it needs to retrigger async read. It seems to have positive effect on perf.\n\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nIt was noticed as a regression in some workloads after upgrading to Spark 2.3. \n\nIt was particularly visible on TPCDS Q95 running on instances with fast disk (i3 AWS instances).\nRunning with profiling:\n* Spark 2.2 - 5.2-5.3 minutes 9.5% in LZ4BlockInputStream.read\n* Spark 2.3 - 6.4-6.6 minutes 31.1% in ReadAheadInputStream.read\n* Spark 2.3 + fix - 5.3-5.4 minutes 13.3% in ReadAheadInputStream.read - very slightly slower, practically within noise.\n\nWe didn't see other regressions, and many workloads in general seem to be faster with Spark 2.3 (not investigated if thanks to async readed, or unrelated).","created_at":"2018-02-09T03:59:59Z","updated_at":"2018-02-15T09:12:24Z","closed_at":"2018-02-15T09:12:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b849ca1449465f9713d75c933a2a13a04d999815","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20555/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20555/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/20555/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b6852aa8a7f0e053985d5b89ba4020792d648f82","head":{"label":"juliuszsompolski:SPARK-23366","ref":"SPARK-23366","sha":"b6852aa8a7f0e053985d5b89ba4020792d648f82","user":{"login":"juliuszsompolski","id":25019163,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MDE5MTYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25019163?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski","html_url":"https://github.com/juliuszsompolski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":82301030,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MjMwMTAzMA==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"juliuszsompolski/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"juliuszsompolski","id":25019163,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MDE5MTYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25019163?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski","html_url":"https://github.com/juliuszsompolski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/juliuszsompolski/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in SPARK-23285, this PR introduces a new configuration property `spark.kubernetes.executor.cores` for specifying the physical CPU cores requested for each executor pod. This is to avoid changing the semantics of `spark.executor.cores` and `spark.task.cpus` and their role in task scheduling, task parallelism, dynamic resource allocation, etc. The new configuration property only determines the physical CPU cores available to an executor. An executor can still run multiple tasks simultaneously by using appropriate values for `spark.executor.cores` and `spark.task.cpus`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests.\r\n\r\n@felixcheung @srowen @jiangxb1987 @jerryshao @mccheah @foxish

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdded flag ignoreNullability to DataType.equalsStructurally.\r\nThe previous semantic is for ignoreNullability=false.\r\nWhen ignoreNullability=true equalsStructurally ignores nullability of contained types (map key types, value types, array element types, structure field types).\r\nIn.checkInputTypes calls equalsStructurally to check if the children types match. They should match regardless of nullability (which is just a hint), so it is now called with ignoreNullability=true.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nNew test in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a followup pr of #20487.\r\n\r\nWhen importing module but it doesn't exists, the error message is slightly different between Python 2 and 3.\r\n\r\nE.g., in Python 2:\r\n\r\n```\r\nNo module named pandas\r\n```\r\n\r\nin Python 3:\r\n\r\n```\r\nNo module named 'pandas'\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, one test to check an import error fails in Python 3 without pandas.\r\n\r\nThis pr fixes it.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTested manually in my local

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nEach data source implementation can define its own options and teach its users how to set them. Spark doesn't have any restrictions about what options a data source should or should not have. It's possible that some options are very common and many data sources use them. However different data sources may define the common options(key and meaning) differently, which is quite confusing to end users.\r\n\r\nThis PR defines some standard options that data sources can optionally adopt: path, table and database.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\na new test case.","created_at":"2018-02-07T15:00:48Z","updated_at":"2018-04-24T01:14:05Z","closed_at":"2018-04-18T03:55:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"22e219b11fd5aafbd066a956f2716e626573b1e6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20535/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20535/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/20535/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c5e403c960cdfb68755df754abf7aa96ac6d40bc","head":{"label":"cloud-fan:options","ref":"options","sha":"c5e403c960cdfb68755df754abf7aa96ac6d40bc","user":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19689699,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTY4OTY5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"cloud-fan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR targets to explicitly specify supported types in Pandas UDFs.\r\nThe main change here is to add a deduplicated and explicit type checking in `returnType` ahead with documenting this; however, it happened to fix multiple things.\r\n\r\n1. Currently, we don't support `BinaryType` in Pandas UDFs, for example, see:\r\n\r\n    ```python\r\n    from pyspark.sql.functions import pandas_udf\r\n    pudf = pandas_udf(lambda x: x, \"binary\")\r\n    df = spark.createDataFrame([[bytearray(1)]])\r\n    df.select(pudf(\"_1\")).show()\r\n    ```\r\n    ```\r\n    ...\r\n    TypeError: Unsupported type in conversion to Arrow: BinaryType\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    We can document this behaviour for its guide.\r\n\r\n2. Also, the grouped aggregate Pandas UDF fails fast on `ArrayType` but seems we can support this case.\r\n\r\n    ```python\r\n    from pyspark.sql.functions import pandas_udf, PandasUDFType\r\n    foo = pandas_udf(lambda v: v.mean(), 'array<double>', PandasUDFType.GROUPED_AGG)\r\n    df = spark.range(100).selectExpr(\"id\", \"array(id) as value\")\r\n    df.groupBy(\"id\").agg(foo(\"value\")).show()\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    ...\r\n     NotImplementedError: ArrayType, StructType and MapType are not supported with PandasUDFType.GROUPED_AGG\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n3.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFor inserting/appending data to an existing table, Spark should adjust the data types of the input query according to the table schema, or fail fast if it's uncastable.\r\n\r\nThere are several ways to insert/append data: SQL API, `DataFrameWriter.insertInto`, `DataFrameWriter.saveAsTable`. The first 2 ways create `InsertIntoTable` plan, and the last way creates `CreateTable` plan. However, we only adjust input query data types for `InsertIntoTable`, and users may hit weird errors when appending data using `saveAsTable`. See the JIRA for the error case.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this bug by adjusting data types for `CreateTable` too.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nnew
