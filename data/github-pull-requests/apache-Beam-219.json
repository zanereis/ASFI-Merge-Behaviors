issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [X] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [X] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n - [X] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [X] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass.

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-02-15T09:28:45Z","updated_at":"2018-02-17T06:13:17Z","closed_at":"2018-02-16T23:04:29Z","merged_at":"2018-02-16T23:04:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"1b9d879c0534b4871dfe9f78de745d3969ce55dc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4691/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4691/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4691/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/f6d8a93bbe9e8c041647da5ffd5ad1c576d03564","head":{"label":"cclauss:long-was-renamed-to-int-in-python3","ref":"long-was-renamed-to-int-in-python3","sha":"f6d8a93bbe9e8c041647da5ffd5ad1c576d03564","user":{"login":"cclauss","id":3709715,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MDk3MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3709715?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss","html_url":"https://github.com/cclauss","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":102283701,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDIyODM3MDE=","name":"beam","full_name":"cclauss/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cclauss","id":3709715,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MDk3MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3709715?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss","html_url":"https://github.com/cclauss","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cclauss/beam","description":"Mirror

contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-02-14T20:52:49Z","updated_at":"2018-04-06T18:27:40Z","closed_at":"2018-04-06T18:27:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"dd9890d87edae688826beab10f0cb850aabfc48f","assignee":{"login":"robertwb","id":486017,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NjAxNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/486017?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb","html_url":"https://github.com/robertwb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"robertwb","id":486017,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NjAxNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/486017?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb","html_url":"https://github.com/robertwb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4689/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4689/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4689/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/f1276531238dcffb096930fc5f880eed2717e19a","head":{"label":"robertwb:test-xml","ref":"test-xml","sha":"f1276531238dcffb096930fc5f880eed2717e19a","user":{"login":"robertwb","id":486017,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NjAxNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/486017?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb","html_url":"https://github.com/robertwb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/followers",

actual cause of flaky test is related to `ShardReadersPoolTest` (not to `KinesisMockReadTest` directly) which creates new instance of `ShardReadersPool`  in every test and then starts new thread pool and runs shard readers threads.  \r\nSeems like when we run Kinesis tests in parallel through `maven-surefire-plugin`  and `KinesisMockReadTest` or `KinesisMockWriteTest` (they also use `ShardReadersPoolTest`) runs after `ShardReadersPoolTest`  then we can have a deadlock. It's easy to reproduce running two tests in this order.\r\nTo avoid it, we have to stop all running threads and release all resources by stopping shard reader pool after using.\r\nAfter that, we don't need to set `forkCount=1` in `maven-surefire-plugin` anymore.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).

] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

HERE\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [x] What the pull request does\r\n   - [x] Why it does it\r\n   - [x] How it does it\r\n   - [x] Why this approach\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.

Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

HERE\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

amount of time for `sleep()` can't be enough and test will fail because not the whole work was done before (flaky). It doesn't make sense to set large sleep time since it directly affects the total time of test suite run and there is still no 100% guarantee that it will be enough. \r\nInstead, we can use `CountDownLatch` to make sure that all needed threads have finished their job.

issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-02-11T20:18:32Z","updated_at":"2018-02-12T18:12:21Z","closed_at":"2018-02-12T16:57:23Z","merged_at":"2018-02-12T16:57:23Z","merge_commit_sha":"9666228c453754c3b11845de9ac52ea5e9ce54c2","assignee":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"jbonofre","id":158903,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODkwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/158903?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre","html_url":"https://github.com/jbonofre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4657/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4657/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4657/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/f965e807e65f47d06c33fb818f28de1ae50d340f","head":{"label":"iemejia:multiple-maven-fixes","ref":"multiple-maven-fixes","sha":"f965e807e65f47d06c33fb818f28de1ae50d340f","user":{"login":"iemejia","id":79476,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79476?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia","html_url":"https://github.com/iemejia

issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

changes FileBasedSink's finalize_write in two major ways:\r\nA. Splitting it into 2 (unfused) phases:\r\n1. pre_finalize - deletes existing target files (dst files for rename(src, dst) in finalize_writes)\r\n2. finalize_writes - same as before\r\n\r\nB. Changing finalize_writes' rename(src, dst) handling:\r\nPreviously it'd assume that if rename failed and dst exists then everything is okay.\r\nIt now checks for existence of src and dst and determines whether to rename(src, dst), delete(dst), delete(src), and/or do nothing (see code for details). Any errors returned from rename() will cause finalize_writes to fail.\r\n\r\nThe scenario where 2 or more finalize_writes running concurrently is partially supported. Success is not guaranteed as long as there are 2 or more running, since there might be race conditions if rename() is not atomic (such as GCS's copy and delete). It is however guaranteed that these failures are transient and should clear up once there is only 1 finalize_write running concurrently.\r\n\r\nSee also: discussion linked to from BEAM-3600.\r\n","created_at":"2018-02-09T19:04:02Z","updated_at":"2018-03-06T21:20:26Z","closed_at":"2018-03-06T19:58:18Z","merged_at":"2018-03-06T19:58:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"ddd9748fe950e0b274845567269c440ea7c7edeb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4648/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4648/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4648/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/9e619a48fc7a660cbe3b58fd4daab4967be39d5a","head":{"label":"udim:filesystem-errors","ref":"filesystem-errors","sha":"9e619a48fc7a660cbe3b58fd4daab4967be39d5a","user":{"login":"udim","id":127695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzY5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/127695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/udim","html_url":"https://github.com/udim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/udim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/udim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/udim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/udim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/udim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/udim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/udim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/udim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/udim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":105834738,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDU4MzQ3Mzg=","name":"beam","full_name":"udim/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"udim","id":127695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzY5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/127695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/udim","html_url":"https://github.com/udim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/udim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/udim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/udim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/udim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/udim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/udim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/udim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/udim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/udim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/udim/beam","description":"Mirror

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-02-08T18:09:40Z","updated_at":"2018-02-09T05:27:16Z","closed_at":"2018-02-09T05:27:15Z","merged_at":"2018-02-09T05:27:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"8c5ebe4a4d158fa8c46640a0401376216a1d11c2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4641/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4641/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4641/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/3b8b75301f3bdbc90eefe5e0eae0b079c60eb675","head":{"label":"robertwb:warnings","ref":"warnings","sha":"3b8b75301f3bdbc90eefe5e0eae0b079c60eb675","user":{"login":"robertwb","id":486017,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NjAxNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/486017?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb","html_url":"https://github.com/robertwb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":54749372,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NDc0OTM3Mg==","name":"incubator-beam","full_name":"robertwb/incubator-beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"robertwb","id":486017,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NjAxNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/486017?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb","html_url":"https://github.com/robertwb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/robertwb/incubator-beam","description":"Mirror

is a new and improved version of #4348. The gist of the changes is this:\r\n\r\n * We now block closing the `DoFnOperator` while there are processing-time timers remaining.\r\n * We don't use `StatefulDoFnRunner` when executing an SDF because this will start dropping timers when the input watermark of the SDF goes to `+Inf`. We don't want those timers to be dropped because they are what keeps SDF execution \"alive\".\r\n * We use `ProcessFnRunner` when executing an SDF. For this, I had to change how we wrap `KeyedWorkItems` in `WindowedValues` before sending them to the SDF operator because `ProcessFnRunner` likes its input to be in the `GlobalWindow` while normal `DoFnOperator` input should be in a window as assigned.\r\n\r\nWe don't yet have SDF support for the Flink Batch Runner because that's a completely different code path. An initial version of this should not be too hard, though.","created_at":"2018-02-08T12:25:40Z","updated_at":"2018-02-23T11:01:50Z","closed_at":"2018-02-23T11:01:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7d255ca842ef44d6d9b67e8f3a9f9199ce25867c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4639/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4639/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4639/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/e8b142948fedbd6a591684e308fab80f61fd477d","head":{"label":"aljoscha:fix-flink-splittable-dofn-take-2","ref":"fix-flink-splittable-dofn-take-2","sha":"e8b142948fedbd6a591684e308fab80f61fd477d","user":{"login":"aljoscha","id":68551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha","html_url":"https://github.com/aljoscha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":55508677,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NTUwODY3Nw==","name":"beam","full_name":"aljoscha/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"aljoscha","id":68551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha","html_url":"https://github.com/aljoscha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/aljoscha/beam","description":"Mirror

issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [x] What the pull request does\r\n   - [x] Why it does it\r\n   - [x] How it does it\r\n   - [x] Why this approach\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [x] What the pull request does\r\n   - [x] Why it does it\r\n   - [x] How it does it\r\n   - [x] Why this approach\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

HERE\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [x] What the pull request does\r\n   - [x] Why it does it\r\n   - [x] How it does it\r\n   - [x] Why this approach\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [x] What the pull request does\r\n   - [x] Why it does it\r\n   - [x] How it does it\r\n   - [x] Why this approach\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [x] What the pull request does\r\n   - [x] Why it does it\r\n   - [x] How it does it\r\n   - [x] Why this approach\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-02-07T03:23:09Z","updated_at":"2018-04-24T21:20:32Z","closed_at":"2018-02-07T22:40:00Z","merged_at":"2018-02-07T22:40:00Z","merge_commit_sha":"9d72e81b5216f3fbe8067dcf940f38ca9c703976","assignee":{"login":"lukecwik","id":10078956,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDc4OTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10078956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik","html_url":"https://github.com/lukecwik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"lukecwik","id":10078956,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDc4OTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10078956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik","html_url":"https://github.com/lukecwik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4625/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4625/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4625/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/506ddcf7e62e993b4f74465bb21d8618b51e1889","head":{"label":"kennknowles:idea-gradle-fix","ref":"idea-gradle-fix","sha":"506ddcf7e62e993b4f74465bb21d8618b51e1889","user":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52646147,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MjY0NjE0Nw==","name":"beam","full_name":"kennknowles/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles/beam","description":"Mirror

Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [x] What the pull request does\r\n   - [x] Why it does it\r\n   - [x] How it does it\r\n   - [x] Why this approach\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [x] What the pull request does\r\n   - [x] Why it does it\r\n   - [x] How it does it\r\n   - [x] Why this approach\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

HERE\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

HERE\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-02-06T17:20:45Z","updated_at":"2018-02-08T01:27:56Z","closed_at":"2018-02-08T01:27:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3eabe7d9996678538d12df3368ac2ac4e00556c1","assignee":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4612/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4612/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4612/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/c0e8c55a687b5f64c54c1eac3c83f63642f44d82","head":{"label":"tgroh:sickbay_kinesis_reader","ref":"sickbay_kinesis_reader","sha":"c0e8c55a687b5f64c54c1eac3c83f63642f44d82","user":{"login":"tgroh","id":429866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTg2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/429866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh","html_url":"https://github.com/tgroh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52644388,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MjY0NDM4OA==","name":"beam","full_name":"tgroh/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tgroh","id":429866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTg2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/429866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","

reverts commit c0cb28cc30733f561d4cc6155be5738584956ebd.\r\n\r\nThis commit introduced a severe performance degradation (on some query pipelines, the direct runner is 10 times longer between version 2.2.0 and 2.3.0).\r\n\r\nThe idea is to revert this change for Beam 2.3.0 and give us time to investigate.\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [X] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.

Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

mode\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION HERE\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [x] What the pull request does\r\n   - [x] Why it does it\r\n   - [x] How it does it\r\n   - [x] Why this approach\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

HERE\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\nThe current implementation throws and catches the exception if worker has not yet started working on the process_bundle request. \r\nRunner harness schedules 300 process_bundle requests and only a few of them are in process at any time. This cause the process_bundle_progress request to fail with exception. This frequent exception fills up the disk and cause issues. So instead of throwing exception, we can simply return error

issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [x] What the pull request does\r\n   - [x] Why it does it\r\n   - [x] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

changes the `PriorityQueue<QuantileBuffer>` to sort with explicit comparator rather then overloading `QuantileBuffer.compareTo()`. This avoids potential issues around `compareTo()` returning 0 for values that aren't equal. It also fixes FindBugs warnings about `compareTo()` being overloaded without also overloading `equals()` and removes the FindBugs filter.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [X] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [X] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [X] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [X] What the pull request does\r\n   - [X] Why it does it\r\n   - [X] How it does it\r\n   - [X] Why this approach\r\n - [X] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [X] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n","created_at":"2018-02-05T23:00:21Z","updated_at":"2018-02-08T23:01:49Z","closed_at":"2018-02-08T23:01:49Z","merged_at":"2018-02-08T23:01:49Z","merge_commit_sha":"3df248b48d3be78f8b37470d427921874f1647ea","assignee":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4600/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4600/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4600/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/c0a6de0be64d647a6919eb5c0bcc04f41be5dee2","head":{"label":"apilloud:QuantileBufferCompare","ref":"QuantileBufferCompare","sha":"c0a6de0be64d647a6919eb5c0bcc04f41be5dee2","user":{"login":"apilloud","id":5972627,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzI2Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5972627?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apilloud","html_url":"https://github.com/apilloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apilloud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apilloud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apilloud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apilloud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apilloud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apilloud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apilloud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apilloud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apilloud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":119748403,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTk3NDg0MDM=","name":"beam","full_name":"apilloud/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apilloud","id":5972627,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzI2Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5972627?

Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [x] What the pull request does\r\n   - [x] Why it does it\r\n   - [x] How it does it\r\n   - [x] Why this approach\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License
