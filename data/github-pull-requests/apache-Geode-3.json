\"upgrade\"\r\n  configurations useful for most upgrade tests. Each upgrade\r\n  configuration specifies either and old version of Geode or an old\r\n  version of Java, but not both.\r\n- `VmConfigurations.all()` produces a list of upgrades plus a\r\n  configuration representing the current version of Geode and the test\r\n  JVM's version of Java.\r\n\r\n`VmConfigurations` also includes factory methods to create predicates to\r\nfilter

replicating to other servers, current logic would first create connections toward all servers, and then replicate data over those connections. Creation of connections will last, until all connections are created, or destination server/s is/are declared dead.\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\nNew proposal is, when replicating data, first try to create connections to all destinations in one attempt. For all created connections we will replicate data. After this step is completed, we will try to create remaining connections to all unreachable destinations, until connections are established, or destination is declared dead. If connections are established we will replicate data.\r\n\r\nFor more info see https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/GEODE/Improve+data+inconsistency+in+replicated+regions\r\n\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [*] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Thank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- In order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken: \r\n-->\r\nProblem:\r\n-**parallel gw sender**:\r\n     When creating a parallel gw sender with a non-existent disk store it will pass as it will not check if disk store exist.\r\n-**serial gw sender**:\r\n     When running the command for creating a serial gw sender with a non-existent disk store it will fail, **but** a serial gw sender will be created. If we then create a disk store and run the same command again it will fail as the gw sender is already created.\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\nCheck if the disk store parameter is set and check if that disk store exists in the system.\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `develop`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does `gradlew build` run cleanly?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n\r\n<!-- Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, check Concourse for build issues and\r\nsubmit an update to your PR as soon as possible.

* When depose primary during rebalance, do not release the primary lock\r\n   before all colocated child buckets has deposed primary. This is to\r\n   ensure that the node becomes new primary can only acquire the primary\r\n   lock afterwards.\r\n * All colocated buckets now share the same primaryMoveReadWriteLock.\r\n   When parent bucket is being moved, no operations will be executed on\r\n   child buckets as well.

server2 initializes at the same time as client register CQ while connected to server1, when below sequence happened, server2 will have a wrong idea what cq server1 should serve:\r\n\r\n1. server2 creates the partitioned region and sends a CreateRegionMessage to server1\r\n2. server1 process this message and adds server2 to its profile list\r\n3. server1 reply to server2 with a CreateRegionReplyMessage\r\n4. At thee same time server1 does register cq locally and send a REGISTER_CQ message to server2\r\n5. REGISTER_CQ message reaches server2, server2 doesn't have server1's cache profile yet, so it wants to save the message to the \"to_be_processed\" queue, but get stuck there.\r\n6. meanwhile, the CreateRegionReplyMessage in step 3 reaches server2, server2 now has server1's cache profile, processed the message and then processed everything in the \"to_be_processed\" queue.\r\n7. Now step 5 gets unstuck and continues, adds the message to the queue, but the queue is never processed again, so now in server2's viewpoint, server1 is not serving that CQ.\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\nWhen we

you configure a parallel gateway-sender on a partitioned region,\r\nthe parallel gateway-sender queue is created as a collocated region of\r\nthe primary data partition region. Because of that, the set of primary\r\nbuckets IDs of the data region is the same as the primary bucket IDs\r\nof the queue region. The aforementioned is also valid for the\r\nsecondary buckets. When you alter the region to remove the\r\ngateway-sender, you only remove the connection between the region and\r\nthe gateway-sender. Still, the parallel gateway-sender queue region\r\nremains on servers. Recreating the region again with the same gateway\r\nsender results in new data buckets distributed differently across the\r\nservers. The same server will create the queue bucket after the\r\ncolocated region bucket, but the previous queue buckets will remain in\r\nthe system. The newly created queue bucket will be marked as a\r\nsecondary even though its accompanying region bucket is primary.\r\nTherefore some events will not replicate to the remote site.\r\n\r\nThe solution is to update the documentation with a warning that the\r\nremoved parallel gateway-sender should not be used on the new region\r\nthat is not colocated with the previously attached region.\r\n\r\n<!-- Thank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- In order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken: \r\n-->\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

PR is intentionally broken up into two commits.\r\n\r\nThe first commit reduces the number of errors reported in the gradle\r\nbuild log due to javadocs from over 3000 to 0. It also reduces the \r\nnumber of warnings reported in the gradle build log due to javadocs\r\nfrom over 4000 to 0.\r\n\r\nAfter these changes, all published javadocs are now syntactically\r\ncorrect, although no guarantee is made as to the content of the\r\ndocumentation. Javadocs in classes that did not produce warnings or\r\nerrors in the gradle build log were not touched.\r\n\r\nFor classes in the geode-dunit, geode-junit, geode-assembly and \r\ngeode-concurrency-test modules, if a javadoc could be converted to \r\na non-javadoc comment without losing any formatting or tags, it was \r\nconverted, since those classes are not intended for use by Geode users\r\n\r\nThe changes made were:\r\n - Add missing @return, @param and @throws tags\r\n - Fix all errors due to incorrect HTML tag formatting\r\n - Fix all errors due to improperly escaped characters\r\n - Fix all broken @link tags\r\n - Several minor spelling errors and typos fixed where spotted\r\n\r\nThe first commit comprises 665 files changed, 9324 insertions, and \r\n4053 deletions, and as such, is not realistically reviewable. Given the\r\nbenefits of the clean-up and the low impact of any possible mistakes,\r\na \"rubber-stamp\" approval is requested form code owners in this case.\r\n\r\nIn the second commit, javadocs warnings and errors will be output in\r\nthe gradle build log, and if any are present, the build will fail.\r\n\r\nThis will enable developers to know if they have broken existing\r\njavadocs, or if any javadocs they have added are incorrect.\r\n\r\n<!-- Thank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- In order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken: \r\n-->\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?
