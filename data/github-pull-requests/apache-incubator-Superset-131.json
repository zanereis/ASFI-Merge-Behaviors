`pandas.DataFrame` object. Given that now both `QueryResult` and `pydruid` guarantee exporting of a `pandas.DataFrame` (which could be empty) the downstream logic is now simplified. \r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\nCI. \r\n\r\n###

CATEGORY\r\n\r\nChoose one\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bug Fix\r\n- [X] Enhancement (new features, refinement)\r\n- [ ] Refactor\r\n- [ ] Add tests\r\n- [ ] Build / Development Environment\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nPiking up from @mistercrunch work on #7716 \r\n\r\nThis feature implements async computation of dashboards and charts, includes:\r\n- REST API endpoint to fetch cached thumbnails or trigger async computation\r\n- CLI utilities to compute thumbnails using a config user (defaults to Admin).\r\n- Able to override method to authenticate users on sellenium\r\n- Thumbnails are stored on a extra caching backend\r\n- Get list endpoints for charts and dashboards have a new field with the API endpoint to fetch to corresponding item thumbnail. The retrieved endpoint includes a digest used to avoid browser caching when the chart changed.\r\n- Async jobs are triggered by SQLAlchemy events on insert and update of charts and dashboards, to keep cached thumbnails up to date. \r\n\r\nNOTE:\r\n- This feature is behind 2 feature flags, One for the API other for SQLA event listeners (it's done this way because of tests)\r\n- Tests are running with the feature flag off. There is a specific tox env var to run thumbnails tests similar to `cypress-sqllab-backend-persist`\r\n- IMHO celery tests should be refactored, one possible path would be to introduce superset docker build (nice one to test also) and then run the worker, making it available for tests.\r\n\r\nShort description of the 2 main flows:\r\n\r\nFlow 1 (Thumbnail exists on cache):\r\n![Thumbnails - Flow1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4025227/75542534-eb7ff280-5a17-11ea-8377-5c9260f60f76.jpeg)\r\n\r\n1 - Frontend requests a thumbnail from the API\r\n2 - Backend requests the thumbnail from cache\r\n3 - Thumbnail exists on cache\r\n4 - Thumbnail is retrieved to the client\r\n\r\nFlow 2 (Thumbnail does not exist on cache)\r\n![Thumbnails - Flow2

thumbnail from cache\r\n3 - Thumbnails does not exist on cache\r\n4 - Async task to celery to compute the thumbnail\r\n5 - HTTP 202 is sent to client (client can render a default thumb)\r\n6,7 - Sellenium requests to the frontend a dashboard/chart visualization page, takes a screenshot, resizes and caches the result\r\n\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Requires DB Migration.\r\n- [ ] Confirm DB Migration upgrade and downgrade tested.\r\n- [X] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or API\r\n\r\n###

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nIn the past we have discussed whether we should use an empty `pandas.DataFrame` object or `None` to represent no-data. Previously `df` attribute of the [`QueryResult`](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/blob/5b690f94116b5b77c0af566d24f298cc6db469b9/superset/models/helpers.py#L364) class could either be `None` or a `pandas.DataFrame` object and was inconsistency defined, i.e., the Druid native connector used the former whereas the SQL connector used the later. This was problematic as the `None` type wasn't always handled, e.g. [here](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/blob/5b690f94116b5b77c0af566d24f298cc6db469b9/superset/connectors/sqla/models.py#L932) and [here](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/blob/5b690f94116b5b77c0af566d24f298cc6db469b9/superset/viz.py#L191) would both throw an exception if `df` was `None`.\r\n\r\nThis PR ensures that the `df` attribute is always a `pandas.DataFrame` object which can be empty. \r\n\r\nAdditionally I‚Äôve also added some basic typing to help enforce a non-optional `pandas.DataFrame` and also provided a short circuit when processing of data for the `NVD3TimeSeriesViz` class if the data-frame is empty. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable

CATEGORY\r\n\r\nChoose one\r\n\r\n- [x] Bug Fix\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (new features, refinement)\r\n- [x] Refactor\r\n- [x] Add tests\r\n- [ ] Build / Development Environment\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nWhen changing the SQL query in a datasource, the cache key doesn't reflect this change, as only the datasource id is added to the cache key. The same problem also applies to metrics and expressions. This PR adds the `changed_on` property of the datasource to the dict on which `cache_key` is based, ensuring that any change to the datasource will invalidate cached results. While this might cause unnecessary cache misses if datasources are automatically refreshed periodically, this at least ensures that no updates to datasources (sql query, metrics, expressions) go unnoticed.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nTested locally by replicating the problem in the issue, and ensuring that the bug goes away with this diff. New unit tests added to ensure that the new `QueryContext`/`QueryObject` classes work as intended. A small bug was also fixed in `QueryContext`.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing

We can revert the PR merge this or find a different solution.\r\nSeems like docker does not support this level of indirection on environment files.\r\nI wonder if it defeats the attempt made to make

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nAdds a new modal to the dashboard react app, which allows updating dashboard properties that are currently only updatable from the CRUD editor. This will enable phasing out the CRUD views in favor of a slick new UI.\r\n\r\nWhen the form is submitted, the url also gets updated to reflect any new slug.\r\n\r\nCould use some feedback on how I accomplished the dashboard title update, I had to add some new redux flows that work around the undo functionality so that it doesn't trigger a \"save\" button.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n<img width=\"912\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-12-19 at 5 54 24 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1858430/71223408-c0935880-2288-11ea-82f8-fe7bc2bc6e22.png\">\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\nNeed to write some tests still, but I want to open this up to feedback.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [x] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Requires DB Migration.\r\n- [ ] Confirm DB Migration upgrade and downgrade tested.\r\n- [x] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or API\r\n\r\n### REVIEWERS\r\nNot entirely sure. @graceguo-supercat seems active in this area?

Description\r\nThis PR implements an ability to configure the logic that generates the schema name for the create table as queries based on the database, user, used schema and executed SQL.\r\nThere are 2 new parameters in the config, both are off by default.\r\n```\r\n# Function accepts database object, user object, schema name and sql that will be run.\r\nSQLLAB_CTA_SCHEMA_NAME_FUNC = (\r\n    None\r\n)  # type: Optional[Callable[[\"Database\", \"User\", str, str], str]]\r\n# Flag that controls if limit should be enforced on the CTA (create table as queries).\r\nSQLLAB_CTA_NO_LIMIT = False\r\n```\r\n## Use cases\r\n* automatically put sensitive data into the sensitive schema and that data is accessed\r\n* put user CTA results into the user personal schema, it can be extended to the team schema's as well \r\n\r\n## Other changes\r\n* get_query_with_new_limit function is modified no to apply limit if the user limit is lower, e.g. if user runs SELECT * FROM user LIMIT 1 - it would return 1 row, not 1000\r\n* fixed bug for the Postgres database where CTA results were not committed and table was not created e.g. https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/blob/df2ee5cbcb8bc6e5cd310b9b9015509db744a256/tests/celery_tests.py#L175\r\n* created additional schemas in travis for testing purposes\r\n* removed unused SQL_SELECT_AS_CTA field from the test config.\r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n[x] unit test + integration tests\r\n[x] tested locally on mysql & postgres\r\n[x] is used in production @ dropbox for over a month","created_at":"2019-12-19T01:51:48Z","updated_at":"2024-02-28T02:47:47Z","closed_at":"2020-03-03T17:52:21Z","merged_at":"2020-03-03T17:52:21Z","merge_commit_sha":"4e1fa95035f7fb8464669967a0b768fe4b1edbed","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":718573661,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MTg1NzM2NjE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/need:more-info","name":"need:more-info","color":"fff3b1","default":false,"description":"Requires

the top right. The Menu was then refactored to React (yay!) and this feature was lost (doh!). This PR restores it, but in the new menu construct. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nPulls from

longer SHA.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\nUnit test added :)\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\"

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nReplaces the current dashboard list view generated by FAB with one that is client rendered in react using the FAB/dashboard api. Design has tried to stay as close to the current design as possible, with some minor improvements. There have been recent efforts to redesign most of the views in superset, so having pages that are rendered in react will greatly facilitate those changes. The work in this PR is intended to lay the foundation for all list views that are to come. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n#### old

CATEGORY\r\n\r\nChoose one\r\n\r\n- [x] Bug Fix\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (new features, refinement)\r\n- [ ] Refactor\r\n- [x] Add tests\r\n- [ ] Build / Development Environment\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nTo reproduce this issue:\r\n\r\n1. Add a chart to dashboard,\r\n2. Keep edit chart, for example, use left-side controls panel to update query.\r\n3. Now, click chart title and inline edit chart title. Inline editing chart title will not trigger save slice modal.\r\n4. Visit dashboard, you will see the original chart, both title and query are modified.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"889\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-12-13 at 10 53 42 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27990562/70844128-60686680-1df1-11ea-970b-f6ea20b10ea2.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n**Note**\r\n\r\n- Currently, explore view will open Save modal for user to choose to save-as or overwrite chart.\r\n- When user successfully saveas (or overwritten) chart, the explore view page will be reloaded. If user chose to go to dashboard, the page will be redirected. By this way the front-end can always being sync with updated query params in slice table.\r\n- This PR will not change the current behavior. But if in the future we decide to use **async** way of saving chart parameters, we should be aware of that some components will be affected by this change.  So in this PR I added some unit tests to make sure the `reload and redirect` behavior.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected behavior:\r\ninline edit chart title should only overwrite chart title, should not change original chart with unsaved query parameters.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nCI and manual test\r\n\r\n\r\n### REVIEWERS\r\n@etr2460 @michellethomas @mistercrunch

filters:\r\n![J9xHISyVV0](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27990562/70761340-b4941d80-1d01-11ea-9c59-5ca0bf8438ee.gif)\r\n\r\nI believe this issue was introduced during building filter indicators or filter scope selector features. The root cause is the initialization value for filter state is wrong, which cause `componentDidUpdate` trigger one extra query when dashboards having default filters.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nCI and manual test.\r\n\r\n\r\n### REVIEWERS\r\n@etr2460 @mistercrunch

So when user added a filter box with defaultValue to dashboard, they saw filter has pre-selected value, but dashboard didn't apply it.\r\n\r\nWe should carry defaultValue, and apply defaultValue to charts in dashboard. And when user add dashboard level **default filter** values, this filter_box defaultValue should be overwritten.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nCi and manual test\r\n\r\n\r\n### REVIEWERS\r\n@etr2460

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nTime related filter has following fields: time range, time granularity for sql datasource, time granularity for Druid datasource, time column, and Druid time origin. \r\n- Each of the fields have pre-defined label. \r\n- For granularity field, their options and display label are associated with datasource. \r\n\r\nBefore we only display these predefined labels and values in filter box. Recently we show filter values in more components, like filter indicator, filter scope selector, and these filter fields label shows inconsistently.\r\n\r\nThis PR is to refactor the time related filter fields's label and display value, so that they should display consistently in all components.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n**before:**\r\n<img width=\"814\"

Sometimes we only get a message. If it is an explicit message from the validator, return it and set its error location as the beginning of the string. Otherwise, return it as a general error as a 400 if the message explicitly says it is a 4xx error.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nTested manually\r\n\r\n### REVIEWERS\r\n@betodealmeida @DiggidyDave

CATEGORY\r\n\r\nChoose one\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bug Fix\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (new features, refinement)\r\n- [X] Refactor\r\n- [ ] Add tests\r\n- [ ] Build / Development Environment\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nBootstap and Bootswatch (Cosmo theme) have a bunch of colors and things in them that have not yet been brought inline with the global styles. This PR will aim to address that. \r\n\r\nThis PR also does the following:\r\n‚Ä¢ Updates Toasts to use global status (success/info/warn/error) colors.\r\n‚Ä¢ Updates those global status colors to be consistent, compromising between the two values used in the Cosmo theme and elsewhere in the CSS codebase\r\n‚Ä¢ Bumps LESS loader, because it seemed to cause no harm and fixes webpack watch mode.\r\n‚Ä¢ Includes the Cosmo `variables.less` file at the bottom of the main `variables.less` file, since it's now acting more like an extension of those global vars. It also lets us include only the main variables file in our components, reducing reliance on Cosmo in general.\r\n‚Ä¢ Prettier-ing of `superset.less` which points out a hole in the `clean-css` script I'll address in another quick PR.\r\n‚Ä¢ Expands the scope of CSS linting to include `/superset/stylesheets` and not just `/sueperset/src`\r\n‚Ä¢ Fixes a CSS-based issue with the Adhoc Metric Title editor, where the height jumps when entering/exiting edit mode. This was causing the Save button to be finnicky, and Cypress tests to fail. When the mouse went down, the field would lose focus and disappear, shrinking the popover, and then when the mouse went up, it would no longer be over the Save button, thus the click wouldn't register. The height now remains consistent. Animations below.\r\n‚Ä¢ Fixes an issue where `eslint` was failing due to the `node_modules` folder in `superset/assets/cypress_base` (fyi @nytai ). Added `**/node_modules` to `.eslintignore`\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nA few of the more significant/visible changes:\r\n\r\nBefore (using a \"pink\" color that's quite near the error/danger color):\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/812905/71062054-6ecebf00-211e-11ea-88ac-5d6807dc0a95.png)\r\n\r\nAfter (using the 'info' color since this seems like, well, info):\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/812905/71062291-003e3100-211f-11ea-9299-ccd5c1b2ae38.png)\r\n\r\nBefore (warning color that didn't match the Cosmo theme's warning color):\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/812905/71062506-85c1e100-211f-11ea-901a-4268582c10e8.png)\r\n\r\nAfter (the middle ground color between the prior one and Cosmo's warning color):\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/812905/71062423-472c2680-211f-11ea-880d-0db971ebfc1c.png)\r\n\r\nBefore (ad hoc metric title bar height

different fields. When we set the datasource upon change we also need to update the controls (indirectly via the form-data) leveraging the state changes.\r\n\r\nThanks @graceguo-supercat for all the help, I would have
