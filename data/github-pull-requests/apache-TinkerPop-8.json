will accept list traverser and single string value but throw on all other types.\r\n- Non-string lists will also throw.\r\n- Nulls will be passed on as usual\r\n\r\nScope is not added to reverse()

here is a small PR that would allow to use the string version instead of the bytecode one.\r\nMay reason for that is that some databases, like CosmosDB, doesn't support the bytecode format for now (it was supposed to be ready in 2018...).\r\n\r\nThis simple option makes most of the job to allow the use of the fluent API with these databases.\r\nI would like to know if there is a place to discuss a change proposal prior to the implementation ? The issues are not open on github.\r\nThere are other changes that I would like to propose:\r\n- Allow variant translation (e.g. CosmosDB uses `incr` and `decr` instead of `Order.asc/desc`\r\n- In the __next__ function, add the following code:\r\n  ```python\r\n   if not hasattr(self.last_traverser, \"object\"):\r\n      object = self.last_traverser\r\n      self.last_traverser = None\r\n      return object\r\n  ```\r\n  The reason is that is it is possible that at this point, the `self.last_traverser` is already the object itself and it would crash to try accessing `object`\r\n- Add a tiny minimal OGM using pydantic that would allow cleaner code (Goblin-OGM exists but it is not maintained, badly documented, ...)\r\n  ```python\r\n  from pydantic import BaseModel\r\n\r\n  class Person(BaseModel)\r\n        __label__ = \"person\"\r\n        name: str\r\n        age: int\r\n\r\n  person1 = Person(\"john\", \"42\")\r\n  person2 = Person(\"James\", \"24\")\r\n  client.save(person1).save(person2).next()\r\n  # or simply\r\n  # client.save([person1, person2]).next()\r\n  ```\r\n  Nb: We can also image the retrieval to automaticly wrap the result based on the label\r\n- (Improve the general quality of the module)\r\n\r\nMost of these changes are already made on my side through a custom library that inject itself into gremlin_python, but it would be better to have it the base

updates `concat(Traversal)` to accept traversal varags and also corrected how it handles inject() child traversals. \r\n\r\nThe updated signature is `concat(Traversal, Traversal...)` to disambiguate from `concat(String...)` method call.\r\n\r\nAlso a small breaking change on how inject child traversals are handled. We mistakenly added special handling, but it is the default behaviour of `inject()` to return the incoming traverser, so we've corrected that:\r\n```\r\n// behavior of child traversal inject as aligned with its current definition & implementation\r\ngremlin> g.inject(\"a\").concat(inject(\"b\"))\r\n==>aa\r\n// wrongly special cased in 3.7.0\r\ngremlin> g.inject(\"a\").concat(inject(\"b\"))\r\n==>ab\r\n// proper way to add a string in concat\r\ngremlin> g.inject(\"a\").concat(constant(\"b\"))\r\n==>ab\r\n```\r\n\r\nVOTE

experimental feature for python to connect via HTTP. This is relying on the python translator, for which additional types were added.

One exception is that `g.inject(null, null)` test will fail due to combination of Groovy script issue that throws NPE with 2nd nulls and server HTTP handler hanging upon NPEs. \r\n\r\nVOTE

are 3 reasons for the reduced performance of element comparison compared to 3.5\r\n1. Relatively fast [`BulkSet.Contains`](https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/blob/ea0bbed85a22ffefc8fa599e9d50ee68d60162fd/gremlin-core/src/main/java/org/apache/tinkerpop/gremlin/process/traversal/Contains.java#L57) replaced with slow iteration and comparison one by one object. Most expensive operation here is building and using of Iterator over incoming `BulkSet`\r\n2. Equality comparison uses [lots of type checking](https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/blob/32ec7f97c0464cb015bdc7cf766a94e6fbb71210/gremlin-core/src/main/java/org/apache/tinkerpop/gremlin/util/GremlinValueComparator.java#L127). \r\n3. Equality comparison uses [reflection](https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/blob/32ec7f97c0464cb015bdc7cf766a94e6fbb71210/gremlin-core/src/main/java/org/apache/tinkerpop/gremlin/util/GremlinValueComparator.java#L142). \r\n\r\nI used test query included in this PR.\r\nTotal test execution time for\r\nvanilla 3.7 is 2700ms\r\nwith my change is 1000ms\r\nvanilla 3.5 is 200ms\r\n\r\nMain impact on execution time is \r\nIterator adds ~200 ms\r\n`Compare.eq.test(first, o)` is ~ 2000 ms\r\n\r\nI also tried to verify all objects types and than reuse `BulkSet.contains`, execution time was ~550ms, but this doesn't work for all types\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-10-12T00:44:13Z","updated_at":"2023-10-20T22:55:32Z","closed_at":"2023-10-20T22:55:32Z","merged_at":"2023-10-20T22:55:32Z","merge_commit_sha":"732d1a2790824d3ba730aaca78c3d1d86d56b75a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/2282/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/2282/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/2282/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/statuses/5d0f276b45f8935a993bebb08ac25565956e6c91","head":{"label":"Bit-Quill:valentyn/slow_P","ref":"valentyn/slow_P","sha":"5d0f276b45f8935a993bebb08ac25565956e6c91","user":{"login":"Bit-Quill","id":63763473,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYzNzYzNDcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63763473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill","html_url":"https://github.com/Bit-Quill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":506343924,"node_id":"R_kgDOHi4x9A","name":"tinkerpop","full_name":"Bit-Quill/tinkerpop","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Bit-Quill","id":63763473,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYzNzYzNDcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63763473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill","html_url":"https://github.com/Bit-Quill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Bit-Quill/tinkerpop","description":"Apache
