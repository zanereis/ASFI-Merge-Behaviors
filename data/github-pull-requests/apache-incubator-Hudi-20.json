Change Logs\r\n\r\nThe [PR](https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/9482) added a table schema update step for bigquery sync tool. It seems there're two issues (this PR focuses on the 1st one): \r\n\r\n1. When it reform the schema which is then compared to the bq table schema, the reformed schema puts partition fields in the beginning, while the bq table schema by default has partition fields at the end. So it unnecessarily triggers a schema update due to to order difference.\r\n\r\n2. Though the sync tool for 0.14.0 does not support big lake connection id (there's a recent PR last month adding this support), a user can still recreate their table manually by adding connection id. The table update is adding the new schema into. external table definition. This does not work for biglake tables, and will cause error: \"Schema can be specified only on the Table.Schema field for external tables with an associated connection_id but schema was provided on Table.Externaldataconfig.Schema\". \r\n\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nAvoid the unnecessary table update.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow. It only corrects the order of fields.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the

Change Logs\r\n\r\nAfter apply [HUDI-6941](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-6941) in the internal HUDI version(based on 0.14.0 version), there is a frequent occurrence of the execution plan selecting \"broadcast hash join\" to broadcast a large HUDI data source.\r\n<img width=\"1084\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/hudi/assets/1525333/80a6e1e6-393a-4719-9914-90b89b4f40d9\">\r\nI tried to investigate the cause of this issue.\r\nThose old query jobs does not set `spark.sql.extensions` as `HoodieSparkSessionExtension` because the user does not known the source table has been migrate from Hive table to HUDI table. So the `HoodiePruneFileSourcePartitions` is not taking effect. Then when `JoinSelection` call `HoodieFsRelation#Relation#sizeInBytes` which routing to `FileIndex#sizeInBytes`, it would return 0 because `FileIndex` using  lazy list mode by default. It causes broadcast the HUDI source.\r\nAnd after apply [HUDI-6941](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-6941), more cases could enabled lazy list mode by default, so the issue has become more frequent. \r\n\r\nThe pr aims to fix the [issue#10343](https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/10343).\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNA \r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nNA

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces `HoodieStorage` abstraction and tries to remove the usage of Hadoop File System classes (`org.apache.hadoop.fs.`[`FileSystem`, `Path`, `FileStatus`], etc.) in core Hudi APIs, so it's much easier to plugin different file system implementation.\r\n\r\nThis is WIP.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nImproves storage abstraction and APIs in Hudi.\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nmedium\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nNew abstraction and API changes for developers.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's

Change Logs\r\n\r\nBuild storage partition stats index and use it for data skipping. Main changes are as follows:\r\n\r\n- Index is saved as another partition in the metadata table.\r\n- Each index entry is a key-value, where key is the hash(columnName).concat(hash(partitionName)), and value is the stats.\r\n- New configs in `HoodieMetadataConfig` and the writer changes are in `HoodieBackedTableMetadataWriter` with some util methods in `HoodieTableMetadataUtil`\r\n- On the read path, main changes are in `HoodieFileIndex`. First, the partition pruning happens as usual, then depending on data filters, data can be skipped further if partition stats index is available.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nStats aggregated by storage partition. Efficient data skipping. Meta sync need not sync the partition metadata. Queries will use the index while planning in the driver.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nmedium\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to track down more places there may be leaks in our tests while also cleaning up a couple of spots that were easier to track down.\r\n\r\n- Added logs to shutdown hooks to see when they are called since they are a crutch and indicate we are missing some calls to `close` in the application itself\r\n- Close some hadoop readers in tests\r\n- Remove shutdown hook on metrics class if `shutdown` is already called from the application.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nMake it easier to identify leaks, clean up some test code\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\n- The `ExternalSpillableMap` is now marked as `Closeable` as a reminder to developers that it needs to be closed and so we can use try-with-resources with this object\r\n- Even when there was no data stored externally, the code would create an external map for functions like `isEmpty` which will cause unnecessary overhead and more cleanup when calling close. This change adds an \"Empty\" BitMap that will be used if the BitMap is not yet initialized\r\n- A few places were missing calls to close the map, so those are updated as well. The shutdown hook will now log as well so any other places can more easily be detected\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nAvoids leaks from not closing the `ExternalSpillableMap` and optimize case where all data for that map is currently in memory.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\n_If medium or high, explain what verification was done to mitigate the risks._\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2023-12-17T14:35:44Z","updated_at":"2024-01-27T03:07:40Z","closed_at":"2024-01-27T03:07:40Z","merged_at":"2024-01-27T03:07:40Z","merge_commit_sha":"2b3d0fa4ffe5067bbef5025c5a6fcc257e26fb0f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2719800718,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE5ODAwNzE4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/priority:critical","name":"priority:critical","color":"B60205","default":false,"description":"production

Change Logs\r\n\r\n- Reduces number of calls to schema provider by properly using `orElseGet` in one case and reusing existing writer config instead of recomputing\r\n- Reuses existing hadoop configuration instance instead of creating new one when possible\r\n- Handles case where schema provider returns null and there is an empty batch\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\n- Reduces number of calls to schema providers which can reduce load on the provider or cost of accessing file system\r\n- Fixes edge case where an empty batch could write a commit with a null value as the schema\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the

Change Logs\r\n\r\nFix eager closure of log reader input streams with log record reader. While reading log blocks, we do make sure to close the actual content and release it for GC purposes. But the inputstream instantiated with log record reader is not closed. Fixing the same in this patch. \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\nFix eager closure of log reader input streams with log record reader. Memory usage when reading 100+ log files will be reduced to minimal. \r\n\r\nMemory snapshot before this patch:\r\n25 log files/25 log blocks were present in the file slice of interest. \r\n\r\n<img width=\"1661\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/hudi/assets/513218/f823ffd3-abc3-4708-ae09-cfdc506276b6\">\r\n\r\n\r\nNotice 25 instances of input streams open. \r\n\r\nMemory snapshot after this patch. \r\nDump taken just after reading all log block headers, but before starting to deser any block for records. \r\n<img width=\"1744\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/hudi/assets/513218/8a2ee701-21b1-46ea-b477-5f341195819e\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\n_If medium or high, explain what verification was done to mitigate the risks._\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the

Change Logs\r\n\r\nFix eager closure of log reader input streams with log record reader. While reading log blocks, we do make sure to close the actual content and release it for GC purposes. But the inputstream instantiated with log record reader is not closed. Fixing the same in this patch. \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\nFix eager closure of log reader input streams with log record reader. Memory usage when reading 100+ log files will be reduced to minimal. \r\n\r\nMemory snapshot before this patch:\r\n25 log files/25 log blocks were present in the file slice of interest. \r\n\r\n<img width=\"1661\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/hudi/assets/513218/f823ffd3-abc3-4708-ae09-cfdc506276b6\">\r\n\r\n\r\nNotice 25 instances of input streams open. \r\n\r\nMemory snapshot after this patch. \r\nDump taken just after reading all log block headers, but before starting to deser any block for records. \r\n<img width=\"1744\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/hudi/assets/513218/8a2ee701-21b1-46ea-b477-5f341195819e\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\n_If medium or high, explain what verification was done to mitigate the risks._\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the

Change Logs\r\n\r\nExpressionPayload is necessary for MIT, but when partition path is changed for a record it interferes. This pr fixes this feature by reading existing records with the default payload, and waits to add the meta fields until after merging is complete\r\n\r\nAlso includes https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/10318\r\n\r\nExplanation of why this change is necessary:\r\n<details>\r\nHoodieMergeHelper reads the base file using \r\n\r\n```\r\nHoodieRecord.HoodieRecordType recordType = table.getConfig().getRecordMerger().getRecordType()\r\n    HoodieFileReader baseFileReader = HoodieFileReaderFactory\r\n        .getReaderFactory(recordType)\r\n        .getFileReader(hadoopConf, mergeHandle.getOldFilePath());\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe payload is determined by the record merger, not the payload config. This is why we need to override ExpressionPayload when calling getExistingRecords.\r\n\r\nIn HoodieAppendHandle we check for SENTINEL and ignore the record since this means that the merge does not result in the record being modified. This is why we add similar logic in HoodieIndexUtils. \r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nThe feature now works with MIT\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's

checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [x] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [x] Adequate tests were added

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR integrates the new native HFile reader with file reader factory.\r\n\r\nMajor changes are:\r\n- Moves common logic of reading Avro records from HFile from `HoodieAvroHFileReader` to `BaseHoodieAvroHFileReader` (abstract class).  `HoodieAvroHFileReader` now contains the new implementation based on the Hudi-native HFile reader.  `HoodieAvroHBaseHFileReader` (code moved from previous `HoodieAvroHFileReader` class) is the implementation based on the HBase HFile reader.\r\n- Adds a new implementation of `BootstrapIndex.IndexReader` in `HFileBootstrapIndex` using the Hudi-native HFile reader.\r\n- A new config `hoodie.hfile.use.built.in.reader` (`HoodieReaderConfig. USE_BUILT_IN_HFILE_READER`) to control whether the built-in HFile reader is used to read HFiles.  By default, it's set to `true`.\r\n- `HoodieFileReaderFactory` and subclasses are refactored to allow instantiating the Avro HFile reader through either native-based or HBase-based HFile reader, by checking the Hudi config.\r\n- Fixes packaging and shading by adding `com.google.protobuf:protobuf-java` and the corresponding shading rule.\r\n- Refactors production code to use `HoodieFileReaderFactory` to get the reader for reading HFile, instead of directly instantiating `HoodieAvroHFileReader`.\r\n- Adds utils and bloom filter constructors around byte buffer, to be easily used by `HoodieAvroHFileReader` with the Hudi-native HFile reader. \r\n- Removes direct usage of implementation classes of HFile readers and uses the file reader factory instead to get the HFile reader (`BaseHoodieAvroHFileReader`)\r\n- `TestInLineFileSystemHFileInLining` tests are refactored to run on both native-based and HBase-based HFile readers.\r\n- `TestHoodieHFileReaderWriter` tests are refactored to run on both native-based and HBase-based HFile readers.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nUses new HFile reader.\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nmedium\r\n\r\n### Documentation

PR is more about discussing with everyone how to fix the existing issues.\r\n\r\nAssuming there are 4 instants in a Hudi table that need to be archived, with timestamps in ascending order (as they have been sorted after obtaining instantToArchive): these are 1.deltacommit, 2.deltacommit, 3.deltacommit, and 4.deltacommit, corresponding to the files a.parquet, b.parquet, c.parquet, and d.parquet, respectively.\r\n\r\nIn the archiving code, the deletion of instants is handled by the following code snippet:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (!completedInstants.isEmpty()) {\r\n    context.foreach(\r\n        completedInstants,\r\n        instant -> activeTimeline.deleteInstantFileIfExists(instant),\r\n        Math.min(completedInstants.size(), config.getArchiveDeleteParallelism())\r\n    );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n \r\n\r\nDifferent instants are distributed across different threads for execution. For instance, in Spark with a parallelism of 2, they would be distributed as 1 and 2, and 3 and 4. Consequently, there may be scenarios where instant 3 is deleted before instant 2. If instants 1 and 3 are deleted while 2 and 4 are not yet deleted, a query request obtaining visibleCommitsAndCompactionTimeline at this point would find a timeline with instants 2, 4, and so on.\r\n\r\nDuring a query, this would result in the data under c.parquet, corresponding to instant 3, becoming completely invisible. I believe this is a very problematic situation, as users could unknowingly retrieve incorrect data.\r\n\r\nHere are a few potential solutions I've considered:\r\n\r\n1.Prohibit concurrent deletion of completed files. While this would ensure the order of deletions, it could significantly impact performance, which is not an optimal solution. Serially deleting instants may be slower, but as there are usually few to remove, it is an acceptable stopgap. The change can be undone when a superior solution is found.\r\n\r\n2.Implement a solution similar to a marker file, recording which instants are in the process of being deleted, and then remove these instants directly from the timeline during reads.\r\n\r\n3.Based on the second solution, incorporate archiving by adding archive instants to the timeline, allowing for direct retrieval of pending archives during data reads. Here I have a question: why don't previous archives have corresponding instant action?\r\n\r\n### Change Logs\r\n\r\ndelete complete instants serially.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Risk

Change Logs\r\n\r\nClosing LogFileReader eagerly with LogRecordReader. We did memory profiling to ensure that we do not hold on to the data for log files after deserialization. While that came out good, we noticed that we are not closing the log file reader until the very end. In other words, if there are 100 log files in a file group, we might keep the log file reader (input streams) until all 100 log files are deserialized and eventually close all of them. \r\n\r\nFixing the closure to be eager immediately after the deserialization in this patch. \r\nBefore this patch, memory snapshot just after reading 25 log blocks and before closing the logFormatReader. \r\n<img width=\"1748\" alt=\"pre_image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/hudi/assets/513218/e7f4d97f-b8f9-4567-987a-c26e18dfa4ef\">\r\n\r\n\r\nScreenshots showing 25*3 inputstreams open:\r\n<img width=\"1436\" alt=\"pre_image1\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/hudi/assets/513218/a77ee73b-e044-4852-b3fc-09ed129eb71b\">\r\n<img width=\"1442\" alt=\"pre_image2\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/hudi/assets/513218/71e8d3d0-dfdb-42d0-abd6-97172eeef2fc\">\r\n<img width=\"1436\" alt=\"pre_image3\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/hudi/assets/513218/aa028317-92c6-4e94-97dc-60bfe1e13f5a\">\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter this patch, memory snapshot:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1765\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/hudi/assets/513218/c822f5db-3135-4bc4-8ff8-0a2fd1348f06\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nGive up resources eagerly and free up memory with log record reader. \r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThe `KEEP_LATEST_BY_HOURS` cleaner policy will find the earliest time to retain and then find the earliest commit that is greater than or equal to that time:\r\n```\r\nString earliestTimeToRetain = HoodieActiveTimeline.formatDate(Date.from(latestDateTime.minusHours(hoursRetained).toInstant()));\r\nearliestCommitToRetain = Option.fromJavaOptional(completedCommitsTimeline.getInstantsAsStream().filter(i -> \r\n    HoodieTimeline.compareTimestamps(i.getTimestamp(),\r\n          HoodieTimeline.GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUALS, earliestTimeToRetain)).findFirst());\r\n```\r\nIn the CleanPlanner, any file slice before this `earliestCommitToRetain` will be removed. This can result in deleting files that were still relevant N hours ago and users will not be able to query the table as of that time.\r\n\r\nFor example, imagine you have configured keep latest 24 hours. You have a new base file written for a file group at time `NOW-48hr`. An update comes in at time `NOW-8hr` and does not touch this file group. Another commit writes a new base file at time `NOW-1hr` and the cleaner kicks in. It will see `NOW-8hr` as the latest commit that is not more than 24 hours old causing the file written in `NOW-48hr` to be removed even though it would be required if someone wants to do a time travel query for a point in time 8+ hours in the past.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nFixes expectations for time based cleaning and retention.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nLow, will keep files longer for those using this policy\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

In extreme cases, flink checkpoint may not be completed.\r\n<img width=\"1074\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/hudi/assets/13013780/f25cda8d-e75c-4380-b660-8ad347c4a6ca\">\r\n\r\nAnother potential problem is that if deleted files are skipped by default, is there a problem of missing data and the user is not aware of it?\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this PR is to add a configuration to control whether to skip files that have been deleted but exist in metada. If it is true then fall back to full table scan, otherwise the logic of whether the file exists will be executed.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nDescribe any public API or user-facing feature change or any performance impact.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nIf medium or high, explain what verification was done to mitigate the risks.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the

Change Logs\r\n\r\nSupport operation patterns like insert/delete/update.

merge a delete record and insert/update record.\r\n\r\nSince delete happens before update/insert, we have to compare their ordering field if we want to support event time merging.\r\n\r\n###

Change Logs\r\n\r\nFixes #9991 \r\n\r\nIssue:\r\nThere are two configs which when set in a certain manner throws exceptions or asserts\r\n1. Configs to disable populating metadata fields (for each row)\r\n2. Configs to drop partition columns (to save storage space) from a row\r\n\r\nWith 1 and 2 above, partition paths cannot be deduced using partition columns (as the partition columns are dropped higher up the stack. `BulkInsertDataInternalWriterHelper::write(...)` relied on metadata fields to extract partition path in such cases. But with only 1 it is not possible resulting in asserts/exceptions.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to push down the dropping of partition columns down the stack after partition path is computed. The fix manipulates the raw 'InternalRow' row structure by only copying the relevent fields into a new 'InternalRow' structure. Each row is processed individually to drop the partition columns and copy it a to new 'InternalRow'\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNo piblic API or user facing changes. However, each `InternalRow` structure is processed and copied individually when\r\nthe config is set.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nGoal of this PR is to correct the default value of `parquet.writeLegacyFormat` to avoid confusion.\r\n\r\nThe `parquetWriteLegacyFormat` property mainly affects how the decimal type is being written in parquet files. \r\n\r\nThe detailed implementation of how decimal types are realised is defined in this document here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/parquet-format/blob/master/LogicalTypes.md#decimal\r\n\r\nThe summary is:\r\n1. If `parquetWriteLegacyFormat==true` decimal will be written as `fixed_len_byte_array`\r\n2. If `parquetWriteLegacyFormat==false` decimal may be written as `INT32` / `INT64` / `fixed_len_byte_array` depending on the precision\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n  test(\"Test COW decimal overwrite with legacy format issue\") {\r\n    withRecordType()(withTempDir { tmp =>\r\n      val tableName = generateTableName\r\n      spark.sql(\r\n        s\"\"\"\r\n           |create table $tableName (\r\n           |  id int,\r\n           |  name string,\r\n           |  price decimal(6, 0),\r\n           |  ts long\r\n           |) using hudi\r\n           | location '${tmp.getCanonicalPath}'\r\n           | tblproperties (\r\n           |  primaryKey ='id',\r\n           |  type = 'cow',\r\n           |  preCombineField = 'ts',\r\n           |  hoodie.bucket.index.num.buckets\t= 2,\r\n           |  hoodie.index.bucket.engine = 'SIMPLE',\r\n           |  hoodie.storage.layout.partitioner.class\t= 'org.apache.hudi.table.action.commit.SparkBucketIndexPartitioner'\r\n           | )\r\n         \"\"\".stripMargin)\r\n      spark.sql(\"set hoodie.datasource.write.operation=bulk_insert\")\r\n      // if line below is commented, hudi will use writeLegacyFormat=true despite the default behaviour being false\r\n      spark.sql(\"set hoodie.parquet.writelegacyformat.enabled=false\")\r\n      spark.sql(s\"insert into $tableName values(1, 'a1', 10, 1000)\")\r\n      spark.sql(s\"select * from $tableName\")\r\n    })\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nRunning the above code-snippet, under two conditions, one with:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nspark.sql(\"set hoodie.parquet.writelegacyformat.enabled=false\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd another without the above code snippet (commenting it out)\r\n\r\nWe can see that the default value is clearly not used  when inspecting the underlying schema of the parquet file using `parquet-tools`:\r\n\r\n##### Enforced parquet.writeLegacyFormat\r\n\r\n```txt\r\n############ Column(price) ############\r\nname: price\r\npath: price\r\nmax_definition_level: 1\r\nmax_repetition_level: 0\r\nphysical_type: INT32\r\nlogical_type: Decimal(precision=6, scale=0)\r\nconverted_type (legacy): DECIMAL\r\ncompression: GZIP (space_saved: -55%)\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### Unenforced parquet.writeLegacyFormat\r\n\r\n```txt\r\n############ Column(price) ############\r\nname: price\r\npath: price\r\nmax_definition_level: 1\r\nmax_repetition_level: 0\r\nphysical_type: FIXED_LEN_BYTE_ARRAY\r\nlogical_type: Decimal(precision=6, scale=0)\r\nconverted_type (legacy): DECIMAL\r\ncompression: GZIP (space_saved: -62%)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```mermaid\r\nflowchart TD\r\n    A[Start] --> B{{\"set <br> hoodie.parquet.writelegacyformat.enabled=true|false <br> defined?\"}}\r\n    B -->|Yes| C{config value <br> is true?}\r\n    B -->|\"No [default]\"| D[writeLegacyFormat.enabled=hudi-enforced]\r\n    C -->|Yes| E[writeLegacyFormat.enabled=true]\r\n    C -->|No| F[writeLegacyFormat.enabled=false]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs can be seen, `parquet.writeLegacyFormat` will only be enforced when explicitly set, else, it is up to Hudi's internal logic to decide what to use.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/hudi/blob/0bbfc0754b051490450b9484b69e2bc708ec475b/hudi-spark-datasource/hudi-spark-common/src/main/java/org/apache/hudi/DataSourceUtils.java#L322-L339\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nWill need to update the config description of asf-site.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nCurrently, to gain low ingestion latency, we can adopt the MergeOnRead table, which support appending log files and \r\ncompact log files into base file later. When querying the snapshot table (RT table) generated by MOR, \r\nquery side have to perform a compaction so that they can get all data, which is expected time-consuming causing query latency.\r\nAt the time, hudi provide read-optimized table (RO table) for low query latency just like COW.\r\n\r\nBut currently, there is no compaction strategy based on event time, so there is no data freshness guarantee for RO table.\r\nFor cases, user want all data before a specified time, user have to query the RT table to get all data with expected high query latency.\r\n\r\nBased on this, we want to implement the strategy based on the event time: `EventTimeBasedCompactionStrategy`. \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\n_Describe any public API or user-facing feature change or any performance impact._\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\n_If medium or high, explain what verification was done to mitigate the risks._\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\nnone\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website.

Impose more granular read process for testing, and\r\n3. Improve the test performance since no engine specific logic are involved.\r\n\r\nWe will add the framework step by step.\r\n\r\n### Change Logs\r\n\r\nSteps:\r\n1. Add a builder class to construct file group reader.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\n1. Simplify the process to construct file group reader level tests;\r\n5.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nFixing refreshing of schemas in HoodieStreamer continuous mode.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nFixing refreshing of schemas in HoodieStreamer continuous mode. \r\nWith FileBased schema provide one has to shutdown and restart deltstreamer if schema is changed. So we are fixing this as part of this patch. \r\nWrt Schema registry based schema provider, everytime we call getSourceSchema, we make remote calls and fetch real time schema. If a pipeline has N transformers, chances are that each transformer could be operating w/ a diff schema. So, with caching and explicit refresh calls, we are ensuring for an entire write, only one source and target schema will be in play. \r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the

Change Logs\r\n\r\nit’s a regression of HUDI-6539, while previously we support concurrent archiving, the concurrent archiving results in duplicates of instants but for audit purposes it still works, and our new file slicing also allows duplicates there.\r\nThe best solution is we guard the archiving with explicit lock, but for many production users, they do not config the lock with async separate table services there, so currently we just fallback to the old support. Might needs more discussion if we want to remove the duplicates(either the archiving timeline compaction takes over or the writer just do as single writer).\r\n\r\nSee an example we got multiple clean completed metadata file: \r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/hudi/assets/7644508/ad66b0b7-9591-4b4a-b657-f7a8aea7dae0)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website.
