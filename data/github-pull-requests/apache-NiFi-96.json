looking at the test failure that was reported, it was a ConcurrentModificationException in the close() method of SocketChannelDispatcher, which happens when looping over selector.keys().\n\nWhen the processor is unscheduled it calls stop() then close(). The stop method sets a stopped flag that the run method uses as an exit condition, and then calls selector.wakeup(). It appears that it would be possible for the run method to have not fully finished before close() is called, making it possible for the selector's keys to get modified while close() is happening.\n\nI was never able to produce the test failure locally, so if someone who encountered it could test this change it would be

updated PutEmail to avoid an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in the case where the FROM property evaluates to an empty string.\n\nReading through code in MimeMessage, message.addFrom(InternetAddress[]) is equivalent to message.setFrom(String) in the case where the array has length 1 and will clear the sender when the array has length 0 (rather than throwing an exception).\n\nI have not made any changes to TestPutEmail. To provide more complete testing I think it would be necessary to do a little refactoring to allow the static call to Transport.send() to be stubbed. Possibly introducing a PutEmail.send() method that would be overridden when

users typically don't have to worry about supplying a trailing slash....until they work with some Java programs like Nifi.\nAn input path such as \"E:\\git\\nifi\\nifi-nar-bundles\\nifi-standard-bundle\\nifi-standard-processors\\src\\test\\resources\\CharacterSetConversionSamples\\TestInput\" that does not have a trailing slash will cause NiFi to parse everything in CharacterSetConversionSamples....not the TestInput folder.  To remedy the situation, Windows users just need to add the trailing slash \\ such as \"E:\\git\\nifi\\nifi-nar-bundles\\nifi-standard-bundle\\nifi-standard-processors\\src\\test\\resources\\CharacterSetConversionSamples\\TestInput\\\" and then NiFi is able to use the correct path and not pickup extra files from the unexpected parent folder.\n\nGiving this extra hint for Windows users is an easier workaround for now than doing Windows OS detection with

pull request adds a ListenRELP processor which includes refactoring code that was previously part of ListenSyslog into a reusable framework for implementing listener processors, as well as back-end code for handling the RELP protocol.\n## Overivew\n- The listen package in nifi-processor-utils contains the generic dispatcher/handler code along with an AbstractListenEventProcessor which is the base class for future processors that want to act as a server reading data off a channel.\n- The relp package in nifi-standard-processors contains the RELP specific implementations for the \"listen\" classes, along with other back-end code for the RELP protocol.\n- ListenRELP extends AbstractListenEventProcessor\n## Testing\n\nI tested this against rsyslog 8.x putting the following in /etc/rsyslog.conf:\n\n```\nmodule(load=\"omrelp\")\naction(type=\"omrelp\" target=\"centralserv\" port=\"2514\")\n```\n\nWith TLS:\n\n```\naction(type=\"omrelp\" target=\"192.168.233.153″ port=\"20514″ tls=\"on\"\ntls.caCert=\"/home/test/cert/ca.pem\"\ntls.myCert=\"/home/test/cert/ubuntu1-cert.pem\"\ntls.myPrivKey=\"/home/test/cert/ubuntu1-key.pem\"\ntls.authmode=\"name\"\ntls.permittedpeer=[\"ubuntu-server\"]\n)\n```\n\nRELP Reference:\n\n```\nhttp://www.rsyslog.com/doc/relp.html\nhttp://www.rsyslog.com/using-tls-with-relp/\n```\n\nRELPFrameProducer in nifi-standard-processors src/test/java/org.apache.nifi.processors.standard.relp can also be used to act as an rsyslog server sending messages to ListenRELP.\n","created_at":"2016-01-19T22:59:54Z","updated_at":"2016-01-22T21:29:37Z","closed_at":"2016-01-22T21:29:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"903b926fe3d49311ce8daa80fcb3f5f651a3587f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/179/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/179/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/179/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/statuses/c80a010fd6d9abbf80752df5fb4bf698b65de854","head":{"label":"bbende:NIFI-1273","ref":"NIFI-1273","sha":"c80a010fd6d9abbf80752df5fb4bf698b65de854","user":{"login":"bbende","id":605416,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTQxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/605416?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende","html_url":"https://github.com/bbende","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":48186740,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0ODE4Njc0MA==","name":"nifi","full_name":"bbende/nifi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bbende","id":605416,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTQxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/605416?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende","html_url":"https://github.com/bbende","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bbende/nifi","description":"Mirror

ControllerServiceNode by adding enable(..), disable(..) and isActive() operations. See javadocs for more details in both ControllerServiceNode and StandardControllerServiceNode\n\nRefactored service enable/disable logic in StandardProcessScheduler and StandardControllerServiceNode . Below are some of the notes:\n- No need for resetting class loader since its going to derive from the class loader of the service. In other words any classes that aren’t loaded and will be loaded within the scope of the already loaded service will be loaded by the class lower of that service\n- No need to control 'scheduleState.isScheduled()’ since the logic has changed to use CAS operation on state update and the service state change is now atomic.\n- Removed Thread.sleep(..) and while(true) loop in favor of rescheduling re-tries achieving better thread utilization since the thread that would normally block in Thread.sleep(..) is now reused.\n- Added tests and validated that the race condition no longer happening\n\nAdded additional logic that allows the initiation of the service disabling while it is in ENABLING state. See javadoc of StandardProcessScheduler.enable/disable for more details.\n","created_at":"2015-12-15T19:55:21Z","updated_at":"2016-04-05T12:36:48Z","closed_at":"2015-12-31T20:37:41Z","merged_at":"2015-12-31T20:37:41Z","merge_commit_sha":"8691af294a35c0ce7fd4658e1e6c074aac636549","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/141/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/141/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/141/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/statuses/602c4a9639af39d407976b3840bd842e5b665b2c","head":{"label":"olegz:NIFI-1164","ref":"NIFI-1164","sha":"602c4a9639af39d407976b3840bd842e5b665b2c","user":{"login":"olegz","id":172397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjM5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/172397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz","html_url":"https://github.com/olegz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":41562413,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MTU2MjQxMw==","name":"nifi","full_name":"olegz/nifi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"olegz","id":172397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjM5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/172397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz","html_url":"https://github.com/olegz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/olegz/nifi","description":"Mirror

to the fact that current component uses artificial names for properties set via UI and then maps those properties to the actual names used by Kafka, we can not rely on NiFi UI to display an error if user attempts to set a dynamic property which will eventually map to the same Kafka property. So, I’ve decided that any dynamic property will simply override an existing property with WARNING message displayed. It is actually consistent with how Kafka does it and displayed the overrides in the console. Updated the relevant annotation description.\nIt is also worth to mentioned that current code was using an old property from Kafka 0.7 (“zk.connectiontimeout.ms”) which is no longer present in Kafka 0.8 (WARN Timer-Driven Process Thread-7 utils.VerifiableProperties:83 - Property zk.connectiontimeout.ms is not valid). The add/override strategy would provide for more flexibility when dealing with Kafka volatile configuration until things will settle down and we can get some sensible defaults in place.\n\nWhile doing it addressed the following issues that were discovered while making modification and testing:\nISSUE: When GetKafka started and there are no messages in Kafka topic the onTrigger(..) method would block due to the fact that Kafka’s ConsumerIterator.hasNext() blocks. When attempt was made to stop GetKafka would stops successfully due to the interrupt. However in UI it would appear as ERROR based on the fact that InterruptException was not handled.\nRESOLUTION: After discussing it with @markap14 the the general desire is to let the task exit as quick as possible and that the whole thread maintenance logic was there initially due to the fact that there was no way to tell Kafka consumer to return immediately if there are no events. In this patch we are now using ‘consumer.timeout.ms’ property of Kafka and setting its value to 1 millisecond (default is -1 - always block infinitely). This ensures that tasks that attempted to read an empty topic will exit immediately just to be rescheduled by NiFi based on user configurations.\n\nISSUE:  Kafka would not release FlowFile with events if it didn’t have enough to complete the batch since it would block waiting for more messages (based on the blocking issue described above).\nRESOLUTION: The invocation of hasNext() results in Kafka’s ConsumerTimeoutException which is handled in the catch block where the FlowFile with partial batch will be released to success. Not sure if we need to put a WARN message. In fact in my opinion we should not as it may create unnecessary confusion.\n\nISSUE: When configuring a consumer for topic and specifying multiple concurrent consumers in ‘topicCountMap’ based on 'context.getMaxConcurrentTasks()’ each consumer would bind to a topic partition. If you have less partitions then the value returned by 'context.getMaxConcurrentTasks()’ you would essentially allocate Kafka resources that would never get a chance to receive a single message  (see more here https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/Consumer+Group+Example).\nRESOLUTION: Logic was added to determine the amount of partitions for a topic and in the event where 'context.getMaxConcurrentTasks()’ value is greater than the amount of partitions, the partition count will be used to when creating ‘topicCountMap’ and WARNING message will be displayed)see code). Unfortunately we can’t do anything with the actual tasks, but based on current state of the code they will exit immediately just to be rescheduled where the process will repeat. NOTE: That is not ideal as it will be rescheduling tasks that will never have a chance to do anything, but at least it could be fixed on the user side after reading the warning message.\n","created_at":"2015-11-23T20:16:33Z","updated_at":"2016-04-05T12:37:32Z","closed_at":"2015-11-25T18:03:42Z","merged_at":"2015-11-25T18:03:42Z","merge_commit_sha":"20f162a21adcb892327b71138b269ef5b500d678","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/131/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/131/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/131/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/statuses/d949ee1a1ee529fbf0103b4620fef47832132a53","head":{"label":"olegz:NIFI-1192B","ref":"NIFI-1192B","sha":"d949ee1a1ee529fbf0103b4620fef47832132a53","user":{"login":"olegz","id":172397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjM5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/172397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz","html_url":"https://github.com/olegz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":41562413,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MTU2MjQxMw==","name":"nifi","full_name":"olegz/nifi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"olegz","id":172397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjM5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/172397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz","html_url":"https://github.com/olegz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/olegz/nifi","description":"Mirror

checks for 'if (getState() != ControllerServiceState.DISABLED)’ from StandardControllerServiceNode.verifyCanEnable(..) operations based on the discussion that we had in NIFI-1143 where ‘enablable’

StandardControllerServiceProvider.enableReferencingServices(..) since:\n1. It had the same check ordering issue on service state between ENABLING and ENABLED as was described in NIFI-1143.\n2. Removed redundant recursiveReferences computation\n3. There was two loops iterating over the same collection, so merged that into one\n4.

implementation of DBCPConnectionPool was attempting to test if connection could be obtained via dataSource.getConnection().\nSuch call is naturally a blocking call and the duration of the block is dependent on driver implementation. Some drivers (e.g., Phoenix - https://phoenix.apache.org/installation.html)\nattempts numerous retries before failing creating a deadlock when attempt was made to disable DBCPConnectionPool which was still being enabled.\n\nThis fix removes the connection test from DBCPConnectionPool.onConfigured() operation returning successfully upon creation of DataSource.\nFor more details see comments in

a patch to renew ticket every 4 hours to avoid inactive Kerberos tickets. This was an issue found when running Kerberos enabled Hadoop processors for a long period of time. This technically _should_ have been handled by the Hadoop library, but due to unknown issues, the renewal thread inside of Hadoop doesn't seem to be doing that. \n\nThis patch is fairly simplistic, and applies to all Hadoop processors as it's implemented at on the AbstractHadoopProcessor. The kerberos ticket age is checked against a threshold (4 hours is a safe bet) when getFileSystem() is called. If the age exceeds the threshold, we re-login using the UserGroupInformation class before passing back the filesystem.

cloned the NiFi source code to local directory on a NTFS partition in Linux, and was surprised, when one of the standard test case failed on my box. The problem was with the last step of `TestGetFile.testAttributes()`, which checks, whether the file permission modification is working.\n\nThe original implementation used `Files.setPosixFilePermissions()` method to set the file permission, and if no exception was raised (`verifyPermissions`), it made this file permission check.\n\nIf you have a NTFS partition mounted in Linux, you are unable to change the permissions of your files, which is controlled globally with the `fmask` and `dmask` mount options. It means, that you are able to run `chmod` commands without any error, but it does not have any effect.\n\nFrom Java perspective, the `Files.setPosixFilePermissions()` was successful (no exception), but the file's permissions were not changed, and the last check failed.\n\nAn extra check is needed and set `verifyPermissions` to true, only if the `Files.setPosixFilePermissions()` changed the permissions of `targetPath`.\n","created_at":"2015-09-24T11:06:24Z","updated_at":"2015-10-17T14:55:30Z","closed_at":"2015-10-17T14:48:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cecbb98f50dc2f6951be3f3a81a661bdcd774d3b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/95/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/95/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/95/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/statuses/46edb8ce4c6c6f837bb6e7b279d8642f96bbba47","head":{"label":"ImpressTV:NIFI-995","ref":"NIFI-995","sha":"46edb8ce4c6c6f837bb6e7b279d8642f96bbba47","user":{"login":"ImpressTV","id":8876407,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg4NzY0MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8876407?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ImpressTV","html_url":"https://github.com/ImpressTV","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ImpressTV/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ImpressTV/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ImpressTV/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ImpressTV/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ImpressTV/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ImpressTV/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ImpressTV/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ImpressTV/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ImpressTV/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42052749,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjA1Mjc0OQ==","name":"nifi","full_name":"ImpressTV/nifi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ImpressTV","id":8876407,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg4NzY0MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8876407?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ImpressTV","html_url":"https://github.com/ImpressTV","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ImpressTV/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ImpressTV/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ImpressTV/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ImpressTV/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ImpressTV/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ImpressTV/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ImpressTV/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ImpressTV/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ImpressTV/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ImpressTV/nifi","description":"Mirror

distributed map cache server is a great tool for caching along with the cache client (DistributedMapCacheClientService), but after you configure and enable it, it is a black box. You are unable to get any information from the cache e.g how much entries live in the cache.\n\nThe purpose of this PR to create an extended cache interface and associated implementations to support the size() operation, which returns the number of entries in the distributed cache.\n\nIt could be a first step in a direction of a more transparent cache, where the user can understand, what happens with the distributed cache. I mean after the size() operation, it could be really helpful to implement a stats() command, which s used to query the server about statistics it\nmaintains and other internal data (e.g. evictions, hit rates, ...).\n\nSimilar to:\n- memcached : https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17952_01/refman-5.0-en/ha-memcached-stats-general.html\n- couchbase: http://blog.couchbase.com/monitoring-couchbase-cluster\n- redis: http://haydenjames.io/using-redis-stat-for-redis-statistics-tracking/\n\nI implemented a really simple command line tool, which can interact with the cache server from the command line, e.g. get a cache entry and it also able to get the size of the cache, which could be useful, when you would like to debug cache related problems, or just get basic interaction with the cache.\n","created_at":"2015-09-24T10:30:16Z","updated_at":"2015-11-30T16:00:11Z","closed_at":"2015-11-30T16:00:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"20f4cd5e6657d7db26b416c4d6e16aca940a4f99","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/94/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/94/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/94/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/statuses/5a8578a70db1b9c61d26bbd06132ee035929378f","head":{"label":"ImpressTV:NIFI-989","ref":"NIFI-989","sha":"5a8578a70db1b9c61d26bbd06132ee035929378f","user":{"login":"ImpressTV","id":8876407,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg4NzY0MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8876407?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ImpressTV","html_url":"https://github.com/ImpressTV","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ImpressTV/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ImpressTV/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ImpressTV/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ImpressTV/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ImpressTV/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ImpressTV/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ImpressTV/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ImpressTV/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ImpressTV/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42052749,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjA1Mjc0OQ==","name":"nifi","full_name":"ImpressTV/nifi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ImpressTV","id":8876407,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg4NzY0MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8876407?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ImpressTV","html_url":"https://github.com/ImpressTV","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ImpressTV/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ImpressTV/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ImpressTV/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ImpressTV/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ImpressTV/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ImpressTV/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ImpressTV/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ImpressTV/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ImpressTV/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ImpressTV/nifi","description":"Mirror

is a standard controller service, called DistributedMapCacheServer, which provides a distributed cache, and an associated DistributedMapCacheClientService to interact with the cache.

If the cache already contains the entry and the cache update strategy is 'keep original' the entry is not
