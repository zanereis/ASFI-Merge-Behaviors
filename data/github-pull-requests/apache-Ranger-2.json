What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nA property/flag can be set via hbase service configs wherein during column level authorization, it can be used to determine if an authorization at column family can be used to determine if column authorization can be shortcircuited as an optimization (there will be audit behavior changes in this case). This is useful for improving performance especially for multiget and multiput workloads wherein thousands of columns can come in the authorization request and just checking column family level access can improve performance drastically\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting test cases work\r\n\r\nNew test cases have been added for hbase. The test cases cover the scan operation bug addressed in RANGER-4977 and also covers new unit test cases for testing correctness of column authorization shortcircuiting. These minicluster cased test cases do not work on master branch (because they are ignored using junit ignore annotation -- currently being tracked at https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/RANGER-4686 and was caused due to hadoop version upgrades) \r\nI have verified that the new added test cases work on my private fork.\r\n\r\nPerformance analysis:\r\nMultiput workload command: \r\n`time hbase ltt

support shortcircuit column auth\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nRANGER-4977: Introduced a new SELF_AND_ALL_DESCENDANTS ResourceMatchingScope which is now used for column family authorization which fixes bug in scan operation wherein a denied column was also being returned in the scan operation. \r\n\r\nRANGER-4670: A property/flag can be set via hbase service configs wherein during column level authorization, it can be used to determine if an authorization at column family can be used to determine if column authorization can be shortcircuited as an optimization (there will be audit behavior changes in this case). This is useful for improving performance especially for multiget and multiput workloads wherein thousands of columns can come in the authorization request and just checking column family level access can improve performance drastically\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit test cases have been added for the policy engine for the new ResourceMatchingScope of SELF_AND_ALL_DESCENDANTS. \r\nNew test cases have also been added for hbase. The test cases cover the scan operation bug and also covers new unit test cases for testing correctness of column authorization shortcircuiting. These test cases do not work on master branch (because they are ignored using junit ignore annotation) currently https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/RANGER-4686 but I have verified that they work on my private fork.

You must upgrade to version 7.17.22 to fix this vulnerability. \r\n\r\nFor the moment, it is not easy to upgrade to a more current version than 7.17.22 since the Elastic API is not backwards compatible and changes the implementation a lot. \r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nBy running ./build_ranger_using_docker.sh and unit test ElasticSearchAccessAuditsServiceTest\r\n<img

down RestHighLevelClient client\r\nError encountered -> ElasticSearchAccessAuditsServiceTest -> ERROR org.apache.ranger.audit.provider.BaseAuditHandler – Error sending message to ElasticSearch java.lang.RuntimeException: Cannot execute request; I/O reactor status: STOPPED</resthighlevelclient>.\r\n\r\nDetails:\r\n\r\nError in using a try-with-resources block in ElasticSearchAuditDestination because it closes the ElasticSearch client prematurely. In a try-with-resources block, any resource that implements the AutoCloseable interface will automatically close at the end of the block, which may cause the ElasticSearch client to close before its use is complete.  To avoid this problem, we remove the try-with-resources usage for the ElasticSearch client because it already explicitly closes the client when it is no longer needed, specifically in RestHighLevelClient which implements Closeable's close method.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nBy running ./build_ranger_using_docker.sh and unit test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes some syntactic mistakes on the Dockerfiles involved in the Ranger build in a Dockerized environment. The 3 main issues I have fixed are:\r\n\r\n- `RUN if [ \"${OS_NAME}\" == \"UBUNTU\" ]; then ...`: the commands enclosed in this if-condition will never be executed because the shell used for this command is `/bin/sh`, which requires a single `=` for string comparison.\r\n- For some reasons, the `ENV JAVA_HOME /usr/lib/...` Dockerfile command is placed inside the `RUN` command. I put it before the `RUN` command in order to use the `JAVA_HOME` env variable in the shell script.\r\n- Many env variables are initialized using the alternative syntax `ENV MY_ENV_VAR value1`, which is not compliant with the guidelines, that suggests using `ENV MY_ENV_VAR=value1`. I quote from the [`ENV` reference](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/#env): \r\n  > The alternative syntax is supported for backward compatibility, but discouraged for the reasons outlined above, and may be removed in a future release.\r\n  \r\n  I rewrote only some of them, in case you preferred another PR for a general Dockerfile/compose improvements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nBy running

    When the number of policies is very large, such as exceeding 100,000, the policy file may grow larger than 100MB. In this case, the plugin may take several seconds or even longer to write the policies to the cache file using FileWriter. During this process, from clearing to writing the policy file, there may be issues with insufficient permissions. To resolve this issue, we can write the policy to a temporary file first and then use an atomic MV (which can be configured as a parameter) to handle the situation.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n- Add support for impala services in ranger docker environment, impala images come pre-built with ranger-plugin.\r\n- Hive and Impala use the same service definition in this setup.\r\n- Impala needs to connect to HMS, which is part of ranger-hive container, so in this setup impala requires hive container running.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nCI: `impalad, impala-statestored and impala-catalogd` containers are running successfully.\r\n","created_at":"2024-08-26T19:36:53Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T05:07:00Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"204b370cd7c76a91bac837400368304df943a86c","assignee":{"login":"kumaab","id":16475454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDc1NDU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16475454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumaab","html_url":"https://github.com/kumaab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumaab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumaab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumaab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumaab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumaab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumaab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumaab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumaab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumaab/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"kumaab","id":16475454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDc1NDU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16475454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumaab","html_url":"https://github.com/kumaab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumaab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumaab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumaab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumaab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumaab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumaab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumaab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumaab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumaab/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ranger/pulls/378/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ranger/pulls/378/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ranger/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ranger/issues/378/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ranger/statuses/f4655334183af2027af6a897b0aa4b713c512b26","head":{"label":"kumaab:RANGER-4918","ref":"RANGER-4918","sha":"f4655334183af2027af6a897b0aa4b713c512b26","user":{"login":"kumaab","id":16475454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDc1NDU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16475454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumaab","html_url":"https://github.com/kumaab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumaab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumaab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumaab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumaab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumaab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumaab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumaab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumaab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumaab/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":596416849,"node_id":"R_kgDOI4yZUQ","name":"ranger","full_name":"kumaab/ranger","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kumaab","id":16475454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDc1NDU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16475454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumaab","html_url":"https://github.com/kumaab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumaab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumaab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumaab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumaab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumaab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumaab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumaab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumaab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kumaab/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kumaab/ranger","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n- Adds support for ozone services in ranger docker environment with ranger-plugin enabled for OzoneManager (OM) container.\r\n- A minimal setup for Ozone requires 1 OM, 1 SCM and 1 DataNode (see `docker-compose.ranger-ozone.yml`)\r\n- Updates the README for docker based setup to include Ozone.\r\n- Re-factor of download-archives.sh to allow specific downloads.\r\n- Creation of ozone service during ranger-admin startup.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n- Verified `setup_ozone`\r\n- Verified containers come up with `docker-compose -f docker-compose.ranger.yml -f docker-compose.ranger-postgres.yml -f docker-compose.ranger-ozone.yml up -d`\r\n- Verified Ozone plugin installation in `om` container\r\n- Verified restart of `om` container, plugin installation is skipped!\r\n- Audits are flowing to Solr\r\n- Verified allow policy on a volume works for `trino` user.\r\n- Verified allow policy works for `om` user.\r\n- Verified deny works for `root` user.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1616\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-08-25 at 4 24 27 PM\"

<code>iup_delta_optimize</code> that was leading to IUP tolerance being incorrectly initialised, resulting in sub-optimal deltas (60126435d, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/cython/cython/issues/5732\">cython/cython#5732</a>).</li>\n<li>[varLib] Added new command-line entry point <code>fonttools varLib.avar</code> to add an <code>avar</code> table to an existing VF from axes mappings in a .designspace file (0a3360e52).</li>\n<li>[instancer] Fixed bug whereby no longer used variation regions were not correctly pruned

href=\"https://redirect.github.com/fonttools/fonttools/issues/3235\">#3235</a>).</li>\n<li>[varLib/cff] Treat empty glyphs in non-default masters as missing, thus not participating in CFF2 delta computation, similarly to how varLib already treats them for gvar (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/fonttools/fonttools/issues/3234\">#3234</a>).</li>\n<li>Added varLib.avarPlanner script to deduce 'correct' avar v1 axis mappings based on glyph average weights (<a

href=\"https://redirect.github.com/fonttools/fonttools/issues/3214\">#3214</a>).</li>\n<li>[varLib.instancer] Support instancing fonts containing null ConditionSet offsets in FeatureVariationRecords (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/fonttools/fonttools/issues/3211\">#3211</a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/fonttools/fonttools/issues/3212\">#3212</a>).</li>\n<li>[statisticsPen] Report font glyph-average weight/width and font-wide slant.</li>\n<li>[fontBuilder] Fixed head.created date incorrectly set to 0 instead of the current timestamp, regression introduced in v4.40.0 (<a

being set to a dict instead of a Panose object (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/fonttools/fonttools/issues/3201\">#3201</a>).</li>\n<li>[name] Added method to <code>removeUnusedNameRecords</code> in the user range (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/fonttools/fonttools/issues/3185\">#3185</a>).</li>\n<li>[varLib.instancer] Fixed issue with L4 instancing (moving default) (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/fonttools/fonttools/issues/3179\">#3179</a>).</li>\n<li>[cffLib] Use latin1 so we can roundtrip non-ASCII in {Full,Font,Family}Name (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/fonttools/fonttools/issues/3202\">#3202</a>).</li>\n<li>[designspaceLib] Mark <!-- raw HTML omitted --> as optional in docs (as it is in the code).</li>\n<li>[glyf-1] Fixed drawPoints() bug whereby last cubic segment becomes quadratic (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/fonttools/fonttools/issues/3189\">#3189</a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/fonttools/fonttools/issues/3190\">#3190</a>).</li>\n<li>[fontBuilder] Propagate the 'hidden' flag to the fvar Axis instance (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/fonttools/fonttools/issues/3184\">#3184</a>).</li>\n<li>[fontBuilder] Update setupAvar() to also support avar 2, fixing <code>_add_avar()</code> call site (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/fonttools/fonttools/issues/3183\">#3183</a>).</li>\n<li>Added new <code>voltLib.voltToFea</code> submodule (originally Tiro Typeworks' &quot;Volto&quot;) for converting VOLT OpenType Layout sources to FEA format (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/fonttools/fonttools/issues/3164\">#3164</a>).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>4.40.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Published native binary wheels to PyPI for all the python minor versions and platform and architectures currently supported that would benefit from this. They will include precompiled Cython-accelerated modules (e.g. cu2qu) without requiring to compile them from source.
