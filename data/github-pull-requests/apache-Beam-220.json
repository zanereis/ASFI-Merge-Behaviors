HERE\r\n\r\nIterableCoder virtually write N times using a delegate coder (element coder). However it doesnt ensure the delegate coder reads only the part of the stream it writes so it must be fixed to enforce its responsability.\r\n\r\nThis PR also adds a SkipCloseCoder utility to avoid to do it in several coder implementations.\r\n\r\nFinally it adds a Delegating API to be able to unwrap coders to validate them - coder generics are not handled in current code on one side and on another side several casts enforces this kind of API to enable composition of features in coders.\r\n\r\nWIP: the coder serialization changes so it needs love for other languages than pythons and standard_coders.yml\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass.

issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [x] What the pull request does\r\n   - [x] Why it does it\r\n   - [x] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

HERE\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

a hint to Gradle config so IntelliJ finds the generated sources.\r\n\r\nAfter `git clean -d -f -x`, I created an empty project that successfully builds in IntelliJ the first time.\r\n\r\nThis hint could live in a few places. It could go in proto/grpc nature but during development I had some issues that I haven't revisited. It seems benign to put in `build.gradle` in an `allprojects` block, too. That has the same affect as how we use `build_rules.gradle` I think.\r\n\r\nThe full IntelliJ sequence (very simple)\r\n\r\n - Create empty project first (so you can put it outside the source root)\r\n - Configure project JDK to be 8\r\n - Create new module from existing sources\r\n   - import module from external model: Gradle\r\n      - use auto-import (could be expensive, but our modules can be churny)\r\n      - create separate module per source set (necessary for sanity of build times)\r\n      - store generated project files externally (again, nothing in the source root!!!)\r\n      - use default gradle wrapper\r\n\r\nBuild!\r\n\r\nI have one or two other IntelliJ environments to try this on tomorrow.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [N/A] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [N/A] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [x] What the pull request does\r\n   - [x] Why it does it\r\n   - [x] How it does it\r\n   - [x] Why this approach\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [N/A] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass.

us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [x] What the pull request does\r\n   - [x] Why it does it\r\n   - [x] How it does it\r\n   - [x] Why this approach\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass.

HERE\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass.

updates the pull request template to put description at the top, and encourage better description.\r\n\r\nI have two motivations:\r\n\r\n1. The first line of a PR description shows up in some email client views, so it is useful for it to have real content instead of \"Follow this checklist...\"\r\n2. I've seen a lot of pull requests with no real description, probably because the actual discussion happens backchannel. So it just emphasizes the reminder that was already there, to try to open those up for the community to understand.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand:\r\n   - [ ] What the pull request does\r\n   - [ ] Why it does it\r\n   - [ ] How it does it\r\n   - [ ] Why this approach\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [X] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [X] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [X] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [X] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\n","created_at":"2018-02-01T10:43:50Z","updated_at":"2018-02-01T17:50:01Z","closed_at":"2018-02-01T17:40:27Z","merged_at":"2018-02-01T17:40:27Z","merge_commit_sha":"51da92cce831755866e5c017802532929fdfd872","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4559/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4559/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4559/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/2fe71699e6e9487834a2cc2aa13d29e8754b2241","head":{"label":"cclauss:patch-1","ref":"patch-1","sha":"2fe71699e6e9487834a2cc2aa13d29e8754b2241","user":{"login":"cclauss","id":3709715,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MDk3MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3709715?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss","html_url":"https://github.com/cclauss","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":102283701,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDIyODM3MDE=","name":"beam","full_name":"cclauss/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cclauss","id":3709715,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MDk3MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3709715?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss","html_url":"https://github.com/cclauss","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cclauss/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cclauss/beam","description":"Mirror

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\n","created_at":"2018-02-01T01:58:46Z","updated_at":"2018-02-01T17:25:25Z","closed_at":"2018-02-01T17:25:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b62873d297ffedefdf7cc0d880bebc65a62caa1f","assignee":{"login":"keithmcneill","id":1558085,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTgwODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1558085?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keithmcneill","html_url":"https://github.com/keithmcneill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keithmcneill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keithmcneill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keithmcneill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keithmcneill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keithmcneill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keithmcneill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keithmcneill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keithmcneill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keithmcneill/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"keithmcneill","id":1558085,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTgwODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1558085?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keithmcneill","html_url":"https://github.com/keithmcneill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keithmcneill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keithmcneill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keithmcneill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keithmcneill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keithmcneill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keithmcneill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keithmcneill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keithmcneill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keithmcneill/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4557/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4557/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4557/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/9ec76082f10c7efbe5d7b231b9220839cc215f48","head":{"label":"keithmcneill:patch-1","ref":"patch-1","sha":"9ec76082f10c7efbe5d7b231b9220839cc215f48","user":{"login":"keithmcneill","id":1558085,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTgwODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1558085?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keithmcneill","html_url":"https://github.com/keithmcneill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keithmcneill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keithmcneill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keithmcneill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keithmcneill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keithmcneill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keithmcneill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keithmcneill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keithmcneill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keithmcneill/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":119768299,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTk3NjgyOTk=","name":"beam","full_name":"keithmcneill/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"keithmcneill","id":1558085,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTgwODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1558085?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keithmcneill","html_url":"https://github.com/keithmcneill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keithmcneill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keithmcneill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keithmcneill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keithmcneill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keithmcneill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keithmcneill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keithmcneill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keithmcneill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keithmcneill/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://githu

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

Let's fix it and re-enable but in the meantime everyone can have green signal for their changes.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\n","created_at":"2018-01-31T21:12:06Z","updated_at":"2018-07-03T21:56:09Z","closed_at":"2018-01-31T21:40:50Z","merged_at":"2018-01-31T21:40:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"5a5e71c2288f15ddf78777de0fd975a12b412dfa","assignee":{"login":"tgroh","id":429866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTg2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/429866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh","html_url":"https://github.com/tgroh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"tgroh","id":429866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTg2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/429866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh","html_url":"https://github.com/tgroh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"jbonofre","id":158903,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODkwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/158903?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre","html_url":"https://github.com/jbonofre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"jkff","id":343722,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MzcyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/343722?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff","html_url":"https://github.com/jkff","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4552/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4552/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4552/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/77847f67b712a213f6448798d491f30e9f48862f","head":{"label":"kennknowles:KinesisReaderTest","ref":"KinesisReaderTest","sha":"77847f67b712a213f6448798d491f30e9f48862f","user":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowle

- [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\n","created_at":"2018-01-31T21:09:12Z","updated_at":"2018-07-03T21:56:10Z","closed_at":"2018-02-01T03:59:56Z","merged_at":"2018-02-01T03:59:56Z","merge_commit_sha":"88de0a1271d74c75688cf3c6cb1788e081870003","assignee":{"login":"tgroh","id":429866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTg2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/429866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh","html_url":"https://github.com/tgroh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"tgroh","id":429866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTg2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/429866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh","html_url":"https://github.com/tgroh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"tweise","id":263695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MzY5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/263695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tweise","html_url":"https://github.com/tweise","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tweise/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tweise/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tweise/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tweise/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tweise/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tweise/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tweise/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tweise/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tweise/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4551/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4551/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4551/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/51d61714403e4d98740703a9074af5f4f8e4495e","head":{"label":"kennknowles:ApexGradleWordCountIT","ref":"ApexGradleWordCountIT","sha":"51d61714403e4d98740703a9074af5f4f8e4495e","user":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52646147,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MjY0NjE0Nw==","name":"beam","full_name":"kennknowles/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles"

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\n","created_at":"2018-01-31T15:49:52Z","updated_at":"2018-01-31T16:27:49Z","closed_at":"2018-01-31T16:08:07Z","merged_at":"2018-01-31T16:08:07Z","merge_commit_sha":"7b7e8dde29f26f0a1a77b6a894af07e97599d24e","assignee":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4549/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4549/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4549/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/35aaa4386a596c3c12a46e45b78b80fee9a7625f","head":{"label":"iemejia:BEAM-2578-sql-dep","ref":"BEAM-2578-sql-dep","sha":"35aaa4386a596c3c12a46e45b78b80fee9a7625f","user":{"login":"iemejia","id":79476,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79476?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia","html_url":"https://github.com/iemejia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":58313008,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1ODMxMzAwOA==","name":"beam","full_name":"iemejia/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"iemejia","id":79476,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79476?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia","html_url":"https://github.com/iemejia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/iemejia/beam","description":"Mirror

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [X] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [X] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [X] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [X] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [X] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [X] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\nThis PR adds a MetricsPusher discussed in [this](https://s.apache.org/runner_independent_metrics_extraction) document in scenario 3.b.\r\nIt merges and pushes beam metrics at a configurable (via `pipelineOptions`) frequency to a configurable sink. By default the sink is a `DummySink` also useful for tests. There is also a `HttpMetricsSink` available that pushes to a http backend the json-serialized metrics results. It supports only attempted metrics for now.\r\n\r\nThis feature is hosted in the `runner-core` module (as discussed in the doc) to be used by all the runners. I have wired it up with Spark and Flink runners (this part was quite painful). I tried to have all the code in `runner-core` but sadly, I had to add some code  to runner specific modules:\r\n- the creation of `MetricsPusher` to get a reference to the actual `MetricsContainerStepMap` used in native runner accumulators. \r\n- calls to `setPipelineResult()` for thread termination\r\n- calls to `pushMetrics()` at the end of batch pipelines to have the last metric update and not the one of the last clock tick.\r\nIf the PR is merged, I hope that runner experts would wire this feature up in the other runners\r\n\r\nI have added validates runner tests for both batch and streaming modes: `MetricsPusherTest` in `runner-core` for all the runners  and `SparkMetricsPusherTest` specific to Spark (because all the streaming tests are specific with spark runner - proper trigering of streaming mode is done by the use of `CreateStream`-)\r\n\r\nBesides, there is nothing related to portability for now in this PR.\r\n\r\nDo not squash the commits, they were already squashed to a coherent and isolable features set. We'll squash the review commits.\r\n\r\nCC: @jbonofre @iemejia

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\n","created_at":"2018-01-30T09:59:29Z","updated_at":"2018-01-31T23:54:05Z","closed_at":"2018-01-31T23:54:05Z","merged_at":"2018-01-31T23:54:05Z","merge_commit_sha":"dd9a5137cf141a5e800f5507960dc5b4a9409928","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4537/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4537/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4537/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/d0de803f7a0fce38bc15d27900ed5ec5e0e799fd","head":{"label":"DariuszAniszewski:custom-pkb-temp-dir","ref":"custom-pkb-temp-dir","sha":"d0de803f7a0fce38bc15d27900ed5ec5e0e799fd","user":{"login":"DariuszAniszewski","id":1576384,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NzYzODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1576384?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DariuszAniszewski","html_url":"https://github.com/DariuszAniszewski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DariuszAniszewski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DariuszAniszewski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DariuszAniszewski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DariuszAniszewski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DariuszAniszewski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DariuszAniszewski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DariuszAniszewski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DariuszAniszewski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DariuszAniszewski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":109828390,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDk4MjgzOTA=","name":"beam","full_name":"DariuszAniszewski/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"DariuszAniszewski","id":1576384,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NzYzODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1576384?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DariuszAniszewski","html_url":"https://github.com/DariuszAniszewski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DariuszAniszewski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DariuszAniszewski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DariuszAniszewski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DariuszAniszewski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DariuszAniszewski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DariuszAniszewski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DariuszAniszewski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DariuszAniszewski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DariuszAniszewski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/DariuszAniszewski/beam","description":"Mirror

issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n","created_at":"2018-01-30T04:19:15Z","updated_at":"2018-07-03T21:56:17Z","closed_at":"2018-01-31T21:54:08Z","merged_at":"2018-01-31T21:54:08Z","merge_commit_sha":"ff37337d85aa5af23418f3be4611b913395ccc88","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4536/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4536/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4536/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/4d5e8527e712584da8be0ee8f9f7418981fcfe13","head":{"label":"kennknowles:Distinct","ref":"Distinct","sha":"4d5e8527e712584da8be0ee8f9f7418981fcfe13","user":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52646147,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MjY0NjE0Nw==","name":"beam","full_name":"kennknowles/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles/beam","description":"Mirror

Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\n","created_at":"2018-01-30T01:45:53Z","updated_at":"2018-01-30T06:56:43Z","closed_at":"2018-01-30T06:56:43Z","merged_at":"2018-01-30T06:56:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"7b40982e7d429c57dfaa0f25c2daf24e20d42b26","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4532/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4532/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4532/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/1c64d0770f43c69fcd8a65d18844af3d2262bf19","head":{"label":"chamikaramj:retain_parent_pointer","ref":"retain_parent_pointer","sha":"1c64d0770f43c69fcd8a65d18844af3d2262bf19","user":{"login":"chamikaramj","id":10819857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODE5ODU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10819857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj","html_url":"https://github.com/chamikaramj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":61584074,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MTU4NDA3NA==","name":"beam","full_name":"chamikaramj/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"chamikaramj","id":10819857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODE5ODU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10819857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj","html_url":"https://github.com/chamikaramj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chamikaramj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/chamikaramj/beam","description":"Mirror

Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\nName is negotiable. This contains the simple relationships I've found myself using regularly when producing executable stages, but doesn't do any in-place mutation or modification of the graph.","created_at":"2018-01-30T00:09:45Z","updated_at":"2018-02-01T22:21:30Z","closed_at":"2018-02-01T22:21:29Z","merged_at":"2018-02-01T22:21:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"2b242fe30caa7f64c914f9e453cc962d7d3fff6a","assignee":{"login":"lukecwik","id":10078956,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDc4OTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10078956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik","html_url":"https://github.com/lukecwik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"lukecwik","id":10078956,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDc4OTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10078956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik","html_url":"https://github.com/lukecwik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4530/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4530/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4530/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/9a2d2a6846adf94b7b2be62413bfa40f76291553","head":{"label":"tgroh:queryable_pipeline","ref":"queryable_pipeline","sha":"9a2d2a6846adf94b7b2be62413bfa40f76291553","user":{"login":"tgroh","id":429866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTg2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/429866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh","html_url":"https://github.com/tgroh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52644388,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MjY0NDM4OA==","name":"beam","full_name":"tgroh/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tgroh","id":429866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTg2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/429866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh","html_url":"https://github.com/tgroh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tgroh/beam","description":"Mirror

the Python DirectRunner, we currently use apply_* overrides to override the operation of the default .expand() operation for certain transforms.  For example, GroupByKey has a special implementation in the DirectRunner, so we use an apply_* override hook to replace the implementation of GroupByKey.expand().\r\n\r\nHowever, this strategy has drawbacks.  Because this override operation happens eagerly during graph construction, the pipeline graph is specialized and modified before a specific runner is bound to the pipeline's execution.  This makes the pipeline graph non-portable and blocks full migration to using the Runner API pipeline representation in the DirectRunner.\r\n\r\nBy contrast, the SDK's PTransformOverride mechanism allows the expression of matchers that operate on the unspecialized graph, replacing PTransforms as necessary to produce a DirectRunner-specialized pipeline graph for execution.\r\n\r\nWe therefore want to replace these eager apply_* overrides with PTransformOverrides that operate on the completely constructed

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\nAn executable consists of only primitive transforms, and operating on that graph significantly simplifies graph representations.","created_at":"2018-01-29T22:46:56Z","updated_at":"2018-01-31T18:17:38Z","closed_at":"2018-01-31T18:17:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"830ccfb23b355b3f524fffc0393c28c542d4f632","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4528/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4528/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4528/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/67f40943765a0ddaa49932db423482b1280d7c59","head":{"label":"tgroh:pipelines_utils","ref":"pipelines_utils","sha":"67f40943765a0ddaa49932db423482b1280d7c59","user":{"login":"tgroh","id":429866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTg2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/429866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh","html_url":"https://github.com/tgroh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52644388,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MjY0NDM4OA==","name":"beam","full_name":"tgroh/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tgroh","id":429866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTg2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/429866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh","html_url":"https://github.com/tgroh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgroh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tgroh/beam","description":"Mirror

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\nSome PTransforms have an environment only sometimes. In this\r\ncase, the EnvironmentID will be the empty string instead of\r\nnull, but this should still return 'no

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

updates to Checkstyle 8.7.\r\n\r\nThe checkstyle config in sdks/java/build-tools/src/main/resources/beam has been updated so that 8.7 can parse and process it.    The ONE main issue of 8.7 compared to 6.x is that the ImportOrder check is very strict about whitespace/blank lines whereas the 6.x version didn't care at all.   It LOOKS like most of the code in beam only puts a blank line between the static imports and the non-static so I configured the rule like that.   However, there are places that put additional blank lines between groups so I did have to go through and eliminate them.   The alternative was to define \"groups\" (com*, java*, etc...), but then I'd have to update all the code to ADD blank lines for those groups.   The no-groups seems to match the majority of the beam code.\r\n\r\nIn anycase, there is a lot of \"whitespace\" removal in this pull request for that reason.\r\n","created_at":"2018-01-29T17:56:01Z","updated_at":"2018-02-02T18:13:08Z","closed_at":"2018-02-01T19:44:00Z","merged_at":"2018-02-01T19:44:00Z","merge_commit_sha":"ec7e098a4f3e0f38fca2299c30ba1a784ff5c07e","assignee":{"login":"jbonofre","id":158903,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODkwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/158903?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre","html_url":"https://github.com/jbonofre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"jbonofre","id":158903,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODkwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/158903?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre","html_url":"https://github.com/jbonofre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbonofre/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4522/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4522/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4522/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/9897be0d8ea449fde2c0aa7a453b7e34636d006b","head":{"label":"dkulp:BEAM-3562","ref":"BEAM-3562","sha":"9897be0d8ea449fde2c0aa7a453b7e34636d006b","user":{"login":"dkulp","id":91569,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxNTY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/91569?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkulp","html_url":"https://github.com/dkulp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkulp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkulp

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\n","created_at":"2018-01-28T21:47:32Z","updated_at":"2018-05-11T18:08:08Z","closed_at":"2018-05-11T18:08:08Z","merged_at":"2018-05-11T18:08:08Z","merge_commit_sha":"c712231e3e6b426e0e6cc034294f634a2df6dfcb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4517/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4517/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4517/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/7dbcb11ff1cb9f2b5f0ffdb63bb38b686fdb0c71","head":{"label":"arkash:arkash-mergesplits","ref":"arkash-mergesplits","sha":"7dbcb11ff1cb9f2b5f0ffdb63bb38b686fdb0c71","user":{"login":"arkash","id":35550199,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NTUwMTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35550199?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arkash","html_url":"https://github.com/arkash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arkash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arkash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arkash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arkash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arkash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arkash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arkash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arkash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arkash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":119292393,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTkyOTIzOTM=","name":"beam","full_name":"arkash/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"arkash","id":35550199,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NTUwMTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35550199?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arkash","html_url":"https://github.com/arkash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arkash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arkash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arkash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arkash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arkash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arkash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arkash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arkash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arkash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/arkash/beam","description":"Apache

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [X] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [X] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [X] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [X] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [X] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [X] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n---\r\n","created_at":"2018-01-27T05:43:37Z","updated_at":"2018-01-27T10:56:36Z","closed_at":"2018-01-27T10:56:36Z","merged_at":"2018-01-27T10:56:36Z","merge_commit_sha":"b2e92836202ca32e90e9da3e1fd0fa09a0c781a7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4508/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4508/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4508/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/702de9ae9d48945039684f17e230f6e7aab4a72b","head":{"label":"iemejia:fix-java-modules","ref":"fix-java-modules","sha":"702de9ae9d48945039684f17e230f6e7aab4a72b","user":{"login":"iemejia","id":79476,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79476?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia","html_url":"https://github.com/iemejia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":58313008,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1ODMxMzAwOA==","name":"beam","full_name":"iemejia/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"iemejia","id":79476,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79476?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia","html_url":"https://github.com/iemejia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iemejia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/iemejia/beam","description":"Mirror

issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

to improve the current draft protos after trying to use them in translation from existing metrics support. For discussion. I think they can be further simplified but I stopped here.\r\n\r\nTwo guiding principles:\r\n\r\n - the Metrics API prior to portability had a lot of work go into it, both design and implementation, so unless there's Fn API specific considerations we should keep it as-is\r\n - proto best practice \"Group related fields into a new message. Rarely make that a nested message.\"\r\n\r\nThe changes:\r\n\r\n - `MetricName` already exists and is meaningful on its own. It is a namespace plus a name and identifies some common conceptual metric that might be measured in many places.\r\n - `MetricKey` already exists and is self-explanatory and useful as a top-level message. I know we've chatted about dropping the step name but I don't think we should. `MetricName` already exists for that purpose.\r\n - `MetricUpdate` already exists and is a simpler name for `Metrics.User`. We've chatted a little about changing this to contain only a `MetricsName` rather than a full `MetricsKey`. The current implementation keeps the full `MetricsKey`. It may be for some concurrency performance reason, which doesn't apply to the proto, but I don't know.\r\n - `CounterUpdate` already exists and is self-explanatory at the top level.\r\n - `DistributionUpdate` already exists and is self-explanatory at the top level.\r\n\r\nI did not try to adapt the Python until after we could discuss.","created_at":"2018-01-27T04:02:12Z","updated_at":"2018-07-03T21:56:17Z","closed_at":"2018-01-29T22:00:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"294da407be4c3a6c981555935c8ff142ff0600aa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"robertwb","id":486017,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NjAxNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/486017?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb","html_url":"https://github.com/robertwb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertwb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"lukecwik","id":10078956,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDc4OTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10078956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik","html_url":"https://github.com/lukecwik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukecwik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4506/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4506/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4506/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/b526892b63d6d051450b0cf0fb990c23ca839fb0","head":{"label":"kennknowles:metrics-protos","ref":"metrics-protos","sha":"b526892b63d6d051450b0cf0fb990c23ca839fb0","user":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52646147,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MjY0NjE0Nw==","name":"beam","full_name":"kennknowles/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kennknowles","id":575353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTM1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/575353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles","html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kennknowles/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kennknowles/beam","description":"Mirror

issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

incorporates SOME changes to get Beam building in Eclipse Oxygen.  It's not 100% there yet, but this gets the major underlying setup issues fixed so the rest can be looked at.\r\n\r\nBasically, there are a few issues this tackles:\r\n\r\n1) m2e lifecycle things - several of the plugins that have been added to beam in the last year or so needed lifecycle updates to get them to run within eclipse.   \r\n\r\n2) Update a few simple casts and generics - the eclipse compile struggles in some cases to resolve the \"empty bracket\" generics (<>), adding the types allows it to continue.  In some cases, creating a temporary variable and assigning to that is needed. \r\n\r\n3) website_snippets/Snippets package name is wrong in the example.  Eclipse doesn't like that.\r\n\r\n4) Passing a collection or iterable into a var-arg method seems to confuse eclipse.   Just wrapper it with a \"new Object[] { .... }\" which is what the compiler would/should do anyway resolves that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are still some problems:\r\n1) Checkstyle - the beam checkstyle rules are NOT compatible with the new Checkstyle eclipse plugin which uses Checkstyle 8.x (we use 6.x) .  This will require some discussion around checkstyle rules and probably a lot of reformatting of code. (based on experience with updating checkstyle rules in CXF)\r\n\r\n2) There are still 20 compile errors that I'm struggling to fix, all in org.apache.beam.runners.core.construction or subclasses of those.  All with errors like:\r\nBound mismatch: The type Combine.PerKey<?,?,?> is not a valid substitute for the bounded parameter <TransformT extends PTransform<? super InputT,OutputT>> of the type\r\nAppliedPTransform<InputT,OutputT,TransformT>\r\n\r\n\r\nDocumentation:\r\nThe setup eclipse docs on the website needs to mention to do something like:\r\ncp ~/.m2/repository/kr/motd/maven/os-maven-plugin/1.5.0.Final/os-maven-plugin-1.5.0.Final.jar /Applications/Eclipse.app/Contents/Eclipse/plugins\r\nOtherwise the ${os.detected.classifier} property won't resolve and the protobuf generation fails.\r\n","created_at":"2018-01-26T20:17:37Z","updated_at":"2018-01-29T23:07:37Z","closed_at":"2018-01-29T23:07:37Z","merged_at":"2018-01-29T23:07:37Z","merge_commit_sha":"ce740ebf229d54986fdab39493c309fca6ffb87f","assignee":{"login":"dkulp","id":91569,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxNTY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/91569?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkulp","html_url":"https://github.com/dkulp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkulp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkulp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkulp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkulp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkulp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkulp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkulp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkulp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkulp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"dkulp","id":91569,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxNTY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/91569?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkulp","html_url":"https://github.com/dkulp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkulp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkulp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkulp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkulp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkulp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkulp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkulp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkulp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkulp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"xumingming","id":379733,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3OTczMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/379733?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xumingming","html_url":"https://github.com/xumingming","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xumingming/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xumingming/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xumingming/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xumingming/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xumingming/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xumingming/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xumingming/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xumingming/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xumingming/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"melap","id":19157875,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MTU3ODc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19157875?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/melap","html_url":"https://github.com/melap","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/melap/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/melap/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/melap/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/melap/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/melap/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/melap/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/melap/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/melap/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/melap/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4502/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/4502/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/4502/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/73d04d780849d38925107b84e3838768d64bcb10","head":{"label":"dkulp:ECLIPSE-OXYGEN","ref":"ECLIPSE-OXYGEN","sha":"73d04d780849d38925107b84e3838768d64bcb10","user":{"login":"dkulp","id":91569,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxNTY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/91569?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkulp","html_url":"https://github.com/dkulp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkulp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkulp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkulp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkulp/starred{/owner}

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [X] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [X] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [X] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [X] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass.

Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass.
