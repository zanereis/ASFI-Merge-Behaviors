#32030 - see the issue description for context.\r\n\r\nSome IOs  capture pipeline options and inadvertently pass them to Dataflow

that more IOs might do this in the future, this PR adds a custom serialization logic to filter out the `impersonate_service_account` option whenever we serialize pipeline options, similarly to how we filter it out whenever we convert pipeline options into a proto:

very rare cases a transform, such as a flatten can be in a pipeline without any real inputs.\r\n\r\nWithout inputs, nothing kicked off watermark processing, which then blocked use of the empty flatten output as a side input, which blocked that transform from executing.\r\n\r\nThis manifested as the upstream stage (the flatten), never getting watermark refreshed, and therefore the downstream stage never being able to execute, since the side input data from the upstream stage was never ready.\r\n\r\nThe solution in this PR is when a stage is added without inputs, it must be part of the initial watermark refresh set. Further taken to keep this part of the \"impulse\" set when a TestStream is involved in the Pipeline, since that manipulates initial refreshes.\r\n\r\nAdditionally adds a line to the stuck pipeline dump to clarify the inputs and output consumers of each stage, to make the progression structure clearer.\r\n\r\nFixes #32003.\r\n\r\nIn particular allows the Java Validates Runner tests in \"org.apache.beam.sdk.transforms.FlattenTest\" testEmptyFlattenAsSideInput, testFlattenPCollectionsEmptyThenParDo, and testFlattenPCollectionsEmpty now pass.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

wasn't length prefix wrapping unknown coders for bundle internal PCollections, or for the parallel input pcollection. This prevented Java and Python SplittableDoFns from correctly encoding their sub element split results, since they pull their coder from the input PCollection.\r\n\r\nGo is arguably incorrectly pulling it's coder from the DataSource transform itself, but explains why prism developed this bug.\r\n\r\nThis change ensures all the internal PCollections are wrapped, and updated with the correct coder. Further prism now only sends precisely the PCollections needed or used in the bundle, instead of the entire set of pipeline PCollections.\r\n\r\nFixes #32004.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

intent of this PR is to upgrade the `org.apache.iceberg:iceberg-core` dependency up to a point where it understands a `catalog_type` of `Glue` for the managed iceberg sink, allowing users to configure a beam pipeline with an iceberg sink into AWS Glue.\r\n\r\nThis change is completely untested, I'm relying on the CI pipeline to indicate success or failure: I apologize.\r\n\r\nDraft because I realize I'm getting ahead of myself and should open a bug first\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

a case where if we retry a successful load job (e.g. due to bundle failure), we get a 409 `ALREADY_EXISTS` error along with a job reference that **does not contain a location**. \r\n\r\nIn finish bundle, we perform wait operations on job references, where we get and poll until the job is finished. If we attempt to get a job without a location, the API will default it to US multi region. However, this is problematic when we're writing to a different region because BQ won't be able to find the job and we encounter a 404 `NOT_FOUND` error.\r\n\r\nIn such a case where the job reference

PR contains several optimizations for the Datastream API when used in Batch mode. In it's current state, using Datastream for batch is much slower than Dataset, this is an attempt to get it to the same performance level.\r\n\r\n# The following optimizations are implemented:\r\n\r\n## Same optimisation as https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/28045 for Datastream.  \r\nIt has the same benefits with Datastream as with Dataset (up to 20% speedup).\r\nI discovered the patch was also necessary for Datastream while migrating existing workflows from dataset to datastream by passing `--useDataStreamForBatch`.\r\n\r\n## Use a lazy enumerator for bounded IOs reads\r\nThe existing enumerator eagerly distributes splits to workers. When splits are not all equal in size, the distribution causes a lot of skew. The new implementation is mimicking the behaviours of Flink's [`StaticFileSplitEnumerator`](https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/master/flink-connectors/flink-connector-files/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/connector/file/src/impl/StaticFileSplitEnumerator.java) where splits are lazily distributed to workers as they are consumed which results in better load balancing.\r\n\r\n## Set the serializer on Bounded reads.  \r\nFor some reason serializer was not set on Bounded reads.\r\n\r\n# TODO\r\n\r\n## Fix BQ IO issue\r\n\r\nBQ writes do not behave the same with Datastream and garbage collection is much much slower. In dataset the IO will create 1 temp file per worker, this is not true with Datastream where it creates a lot (20x) more files.\r\n\r\n## Fix double encoding of window in GBK and CombinePerKey\r\n\r\nBefore shuffle `KV` are converted to `KeyedWorkItem`, however the actual stream type is:\r\n`DataStream<WindowedValue<KeyedWorkItem<K, byte[]>>>` \r\nBoth `KeyedWorkItem` and `WindowedValue`  serialize the window.  Since the conversion happens before `keyBy` (shuffle), the duplication directly results in network overhead. \r\n\r\nI tried the simplest fix: move conversion after `keyBy` but `WindowDoFnOperator` needs the stream it transforms be keyed so turning `ToBinaryKeyedWorkItem -> keyBy -> transform(doFnOperator)` into   `keyBy -> ToBinaryKeyedWorkItem -> transform(doFnOperator)` is not possible. \r\n\r\nI also tried a similar fix using `reinterpretAsKeyedStream` to avoid this problem. The chain becomes: ` ToBinaryKV -> keyBy -> ToKeyedWorkItem -> reinterpretAsKeyedStream -> transform(doFnOperator)`  but `reinterpretAsKeyedStream` breaks operator chaining between `ToBinaryKeyedWorkItem` and the following operator which degrades performances even more. \r\n\r\nThe best fix would be to not need `KeyedWorkItem` but that'd be a large change in Beam.\r\n\r\n## Missing pre-shuffle combine on redure operator\r\n\r\nThe Dataset translation will [translate `reduce` into a `partial reduce -> shuffle -> reduce`](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/44a9942719e754fbd1967e475466f404b9f47e22/runners/flink/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/runners/flink/FlinkBatchTransformTranslators.java#L508-L515). The Datastream translator is missing this optimization which make reduce operations much slower.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR closes #31793 with a package private PipelineResult implementation. The goal of tests are to validate shutting down the Prism executable during termination-related methods (cancel, waitUntilFinish) and the storing of terminal State and metrics. To focus tests on this behavior without executing Pipelines, it uses the mockito library.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

#19632\r\n\r\nIntroduce a namepace named \"beam-throttling-metrics\", put under java core's Metrics.java, and use this namespace for Dataflow worker\r\n\r\nCurrently, Dataflow worker only considers several \"known\" namespace for throttling metrics, including bigquery streaming inserts, etc. After this change, \"beam-throttling-metrics\" is added to known namespace for batch Dataflow worker; and streaming dataflow worker will react on all counters named \"throttliing-msecs\"\r\n\r\n* Introduce a generic throttling namespace and counter\r\n\r\n* Dataflow accumulates throttling time from generic throttling counter\r\n\r\n* Apply throttling counter to BigtableIO write\r\n\r\n**Please** add a meaningful description for your change here\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you

adds a base class and two providers for the new SolaceIO write connector. The basic authentication provider just uses a username and password.\r\n\r\nUsers can write their own providers to set authentication mechanisms and other session properties, by extending from the base class. As an example, we provide a GoogleCloudSecretProvider, to show how to create your own. This provider can also be used \"as is\", but it is mainly meant as an example to implement your own.\r\n\r\nIn upcoming PRs, I will be submitting the rest of the write connector. It is thousands of lines of code, so I am splitting in smaller PRs, to facilitate code reviews.\r\n\r\nAll these PRs are part of the SolaceIO Write feature request #31905 \r\n\r\nGitHub Actions Tests

#31896 \r\n\r\n- Updates gcs-connector library from 2.x to 3.x. The [3.x release](https://github.com/GoogleCloudDataproc/hadoop-connectors/releases/tag/v3.0.1) adds support for the new Hadoop vectoredIO APIs, which have also been recently integrated with Parquet.\r\n- gcs-connector 3.x drops Hadoop2 support, so hadoop is also upgraded to 3.3.6 (this is the version specified in [gcs-connector pom](https://github.com/GoogleCloudDataproc/hadoop-connectors/blob/v3.0.1/pom.xml#L103). An additional motivation to make this change is that all the existing Hadoop2 versions have known CVEs. I have done some ad-hoc testing with Hadoop3 vs Hadoop2 and not noticed any performance degradation or unexpected behavior\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

by CleanupGCPResource workflow. There are many stale \"bq_read_all_\" datasets in the test project.\r\n\r\nThere is a consistent temp dataset leaking for Python SDK's ReadAllFromBigQuery. Each run will leave an empty dataset prefixed \"bq_read_all_\"\r\n\r\nCause:\r\n\r\n* ReadFromBigQuery sets a default dataset of prefix \"bq_read_all_\"\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/beam/blob/faff55c2882a0083a8cb8d1e2cf3ec9d365f677f/sdks/python/apache_beam/io/gcp/bigquery_read_internal.py#L215\r\n\r\n* BigQueryWrapper thinks this is a user configured dataset and won't delete it \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/beam/blob/faff55c2882a0083a8cb8d1e2cf3ec9d365f677f/sdks/python/apache_beam/io/gcp/bigquery_tools.py#L895\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\n\r\nRemove the prefix so BigQueryWrapper will use the default temp_dataset_* prefix and will delete it when `clean_up_temporary_dataset` called\r\n\r\nHowever, this will now create each dataset for each element. To reduce the overload, move create/delete dataset into setup/teardown so that they are per worker basis.\r\n\r\n**Please** add a meaningful description for your change here\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

MongoDB connector to handle out-of-range dates\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\n### Changes Made:\r\n- Modified the `mongodbio.py` file to include CodecOptions and DatetimeConversion.\r\n- Specifically, added `CodecOptions(datetime_conversion=DatetimeConversion.DATETIME_AUTO)` to ensure that out-of-range dates are converted properly when reading data from MongoDB.\r\n- Updated the `_get_head_document_id` and `read` methods to use the new codec options when connecting to the MongoDB database.\r\n\r\n### Results After Changes\r\nWith the introduced changes, all instances of out-of-range dates can now be read and later transformed from microseconds into standard datetime objects.\r\n\r\nThis change ensures that datetimes that cannot be represented using the built-in Python `datetime` are automatically converted to `DatetimeMS` objects, as per the [PyMongo documentation on handling out-of-range datetimes](https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/datetimes.html#handling-out-of-range-datetimes)\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\nThis issue has been discussed on the Apache Beam mailing list, with recommendation from XQ Hu to address this issue with PR.\r\n\r\n- [x] Fixes #30471\r\n- [ ] Update `CHANGES.md` with noteworthy changes.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an
