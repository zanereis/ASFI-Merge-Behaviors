@mbrookhart @icemelon9  Could you please review this, thanks\r\n\r\nThe input of strided_slice is Expr and attrs are Const, but it is still possible this strided_slice is dynamic.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds / changes some test to demostrate this issue. If we make strided_slice static and add _dyn.strided_slice, the static version can't support this case, so we have to always use _dyn.strided_slice unless we are sure shape of input is static. I think other _dyn.* ops may have similiar

PR adds GRU parsing to the onnx frontend. Currently this is done by unrolling the recurrence in a similar way to how we handle LSTMs. Since there's quite a bit of shared code, I've generalized the LSTM converter to an RNN converter and made LSTM and GRU subclasses. For testing, I again replaced the LSTM test function with a more general test_rnn function that supports both LSTM and GRU and should be easily expandable to other RNN functions should we ever want to

types with a single lane are treated as scalars in TVM. On the other hand, in LLVM there is a difference between a scalar type and a vector type with a single lane. Because of that, a shuffle with a single index is equivalent to extracting an element in TIR, but not in the generated LLVM IR. This patch changes the LLVM codegen for shuffle to auto-convert single-lane vectors to scalars.","created_at":"2020-07-07T16:45:21Z","updated_at":"2020-07-08T11:45:51Z","closed_at":"2020-07-08T00:32:00Z","merged_at":"2020-07-08T00:32:00Z","merge_commit_sha":"1cd56da000363877181f3bf7d0b312be5dc17853","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/6006/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/6006/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/6006/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/591efca8414ecccbcce51d101b9e02f55e3ebcde","head":{"label":"kparzysz-quic:shuff-scalar","ref":"shuff-scalar","sha":"591efca8414ecccbcce51d101b9e02f55e3ebcde","user":{"login":"kparzysz-quic","id":48801706,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4ODAxNzA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48801706?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic","html_url":"https://github.com/kparzysz-quic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"3f13566b8f612d9cdc4d8e5a9a4fe7824a5840f4","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":70746484,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3MDc0NjQ4NA==","name":"tvm","full_name":"apache/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm","description":"Open

Caffe Frontend\r\n\r\n### Background & Motivation\r\n\r\n[Caffe](<https://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/>) is a deep learning framework made with expression, speed, and modularity in mind. Because of its simplicity, good scalability, fast and other characteristics, it is favored by many people. According to [riselab]( https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu/) who makes statistics of papers collected in arxiv.org, Caffe is ranked in the top four in the deep learning framework, which shows to some extent that Caffe's user base is still large, please refer to [blog](<https://www.oreilly.com/content/one-simple-graphic-researchers-love-pytorch-and-tensorflow/>). In addition, according to our company's research on the market, the demand for Caffe in the production environment is still strong, and many models based on Caffe need to be deployed. For example, existing deployment frameworks, such as [MNN](<https://github.com/alibaba/MNN>), [NCNN](<https://github.com/Tencent/ncnn>), [MACE](<https://github.com/XiaoMi/mace>), etc., directly support the deployment of Caffe.\r\n\r\nTVM only supports caffe2 at present, and the difference between Caffe and caffe2 is quite large. At present, there are two ways to deploy Caffe model in TVM: one is to convert Caffe model to Tensorflow or Pytorch model, the other is to convert Caffe model to onnx and then to relay IR. The two methods are essentially the same. They are all indirectly converted to relay IR through the third-party transformation. However, the problem is that some ops will fail in the process of model transformation, and even the result of transfer out may be different.\r\n\r\nBased on the above situation, we decided to open our Caffe frontend codes, hoping to enrich the use scenarios of TVM.\r\n\r\n### Implementation Approach\r\n\r\nThe whole process of Caffe front end importing model is divided into:\r\n\r\n1. Read Model：The model graph and related parameters are read through the protobuffer API of Caffe;\r\n2. Rebuild Graph：Traverse the graph, then replace the top of the in-place layer with the name of the layer, and update all related layers at the same time;\r\n3. Model Conversion：Read the parameters of each layer and convert them into corresponding TVM OP and parameters;\r\n4. Layer Fusion：fuse batchnorm and scale layers;\r\n5. Convert to Relay IR：It mainly includes its module, params and the real name of the output layer。\r\n\r\nFinally, we can import the Caffe model as follows:\r\n\r\n```Python\r\nfrom google.protobuf import text_format\r\nfrom tvm.relay.frontend import caffe_pb2 as pb\r\n\r\ninit_net = pb.NetParameter()\r\npredict_net = pb.NetParameter()\r\n\r\n# load model\r\nwith open(proto_file, 'r') as f:\r\n    text_format.Merge(f.read(), predict_net)\r\n# load blob\r\nwith open(blob_file, 'rb') as f:\r\n    init_net.ParseFromString(f.read())\r\n\r\nshape_dict = {'data': [1,3,224,224]}\r\ndtype_dict = {'data': 'float32'}\r\n\r\nmod, params, model_outputs = relay.frontend.from_caffe(init_net, predict_net, shape_dict, dtype_dict)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Work Done\r\n\r\nAll of the things that we have done are listed as following:\r\n\r\n#### 1. List of supported Ops\r\n\r\n- [x] BatchNorm\r\n- [x] Concat\r\n- [x] Convolution\r\n- [x] Crop\r\n- [x] Deconvolution\r\n- [x] Dropout\r\n- [x] Eltwise\r\n- [x] Flatten\r\n- [x] InnerProduct\r\n- [x] Input\r\n- [x] LRN\r\n- [x] Normalize\r\n- [x] Permute\r\n- [x] Pooling\r\n- [x] PReLU\r\n- [x] PriorBox\r\n- [x] proposal\r\n- [x] Python\r\n- [x] ReLU\r\n- [x] Reshape\r\n- [x] Resize\r\n- [x] ROIPooling\r\n- [x] Scale\r\n- [x] Sigmoid\r\n- [x] Slice\r\n- [x] Softmax\r\n- [x] TanH\r\n- [x] Upsample\r\n\r\n#### 2.

Caffe frontend test cases\r\n\r\n#### 4. Caffe frontend tutorial\r\n\r\n### TODO\r\n\r\n- [ ] Support more ops and more complete models.\r\n\r\nAccording to the above implementation scheme, based on the front-end framework we built, you can add any new op, you only need to: firstly, add a method in the operatorconverter class, which needs to include your extraction of the layer parameters and the logic of conversion to TVM OP, secondly, register the method to convert_ map.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2020-07-07T08:17:01Z","updated_at":"2020-08-04T11:35:50Z","closed_at":"2020-08-04T11:35:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"43fbc06455f8c2585eab872108430bedefc608ee","assignee":{"login":"FrozenGene","id":7287321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyODczMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7287321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene","html_url":"https://github.com/FrozenGene","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"FrozenGene","id":7287321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyODczMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7287321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene","html_url":"https://github.com/FrozenGene","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":858780915,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTg3ODA5MTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20need%20review","name":"status:

discussion: https://discuss.tvm.ai/t/rfc-byoc-data-calibration-flow/7099/15\r\n\r\nThis PR implements the analysis pass `get_calibration_data` mentioned in the RFC. The main functionality of this analysis pass is allowing users to easily get the calibration data from any Relay module. The calibration data includes the input and output tensor values of each subgraph in the module. Following is an example.\r\n\r\nThe input relay graph that contains two subgraphs:\r\n```\r\ndef @dnnl0(%dnnl0_i0: Tensor[(3, 3), float32], %dnnl0_i1: Tensor[(3, 3), float32]) -> Tensor[(3, 3), float32] {\r\n  add(%dnnl0_i0, dnnl0_i1) \r\n}\r\n\r\ndef @dnnl1(%dnnl0_i0: Tensor[(3, 3), float32], %dnnl0_i1: Tensor[(3, 3), float32]) -> Tensor[(3, 3), float32] {\r\n  sub(%dnnl0_i0, dnnl0_i1) \r\n}\r\n\r\ndef @main(%data0: Tensor[(3, 3), float32], %data1: Tensor[(3, 3), float32], %data2: Tensor[(3, 3), float32]) -> Tensor[(3, 3), float32] {\r\n  %0 = @dnnl0(%data0, %data1)\r\n  @dnnl1(%0, %data2)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe Python API\r\n```python\r\nmod = # the above relay graph\r\ndata = {\"data0\": ..., \"data1\": ..., \"data2\": ...}\r\n\r\ncalib_data = relay.analysis.get_calibration_data(mod, data)\r\nprint(calib_data)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe expected output\r\n```\r\n{@dnnl0: {\"inputs\": [%data0, %data1], \"outputs\": [%0]},\r\n @dnnl1: {\"inputs\": [%0, %data2], \"outputs\":[%out]}}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs can be seen, the output calibration data is a two-level dictionary. The first level takes in the GlobalVar of a subgraph as a key and the value is the second-level dictionary. The second level always has two keys: inputs and outputs, which map to the real tensor values of each subgraph. For more complex example please refer to the test.\r\n\r\n@comaniac @zhiics

PR contains several minor but breaking changes as mentioned in #5960.\r\n\r\n1. Use `TargetNode::attrs` for serialization, which means that the raw string exported from target object may largely differ from the raw string input to create target object.\r\n2. Change type of `-mattr` to `Array<String>` from `String`.\r\n3. Remove `keys` from `attrs` after parsing, in order to avoid potential duplication and confusion.

destructed, but the DeviceAPI object has already been destructed, so when it calls FreeDataSpace to free the NDArray memory it runs into the “pure virtual method called” error.\r\n\r\nI added a destructor to the CUDADeviceAPI class (https://github.com/neo-ai/tvm/blob/dev/src/runtime/cuda/cuda_device_api.cc#L37) with a print statement and was able to confirm that the destructor was being called before the NDArray was destructed. This confirms the root cause, that the CUDA DeviceAPI was destructed before all the NDArrays were destructed (and their underlying memory freed).\r\n\r\nBasically the issue is that the CUDADeviceAPI singleton class is destructed before all GPU NDArrays are freed. The quick fix is to be able to re-construct the CUDADeviceAPI singleton after being deconstructed so that it can be used to free the remaining GPU NDArrays.\r\n\r\nThe DeviceAPIManager class (https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/blob/579da6b771584ff320b9c7edf635b681b2abd0ef/src/runtime/c_runtime_api.cc#L91) is a singleton that maintains a map of DeviceAPI objects for each context (CPU, GPU, etc). The Global API (https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/blob/579da6b771584ff320b9c7edf635b681b2abd0ef/src/runtime/c_runtime_api.cc#L107) is the static singleton “get_instance” function. The GetAPI API (https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/blob/579da6b771584ff320b9c7edf635b681b2abd0ef/src/runtime/c_runtime_api.cc#L112) is used to get the DeviceAPI object for a particular context type that is looked up in the api_ map. \r\n\r\nUpon destruction, if we clear the api_ array to nullptr:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/blob/0dfadaee66de156c1cda90a3d9f160764e5538d9/src/runtime/c_runtime_api.cc#L107\r\n\r\n each DeviceAPI object will be reconstructed. Upon reconstruction of the singleton CUDADeviceAPI class, we need to reset the static shared_ptr too:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/blob/0dfadaee66de156c1cda90a3d9f160764e5538d9/src/runtime/cuda/cuda_device_api.cc#L210-L215","created_at":"2020-07-03T00:09:02Z","updated_at":"2020-08-19T14:02:22Z","closed_at":"2020-08-19T14:00:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4fe6837bed59eaf029294c0fe0b04cfe478e41bd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":961828004,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5NjE4MjgwMDQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20need%20update","name":"status:

LLVM 11+ the distinction between fixed and scalable vector types has become more explicit. Before the introduction of scalable vector types `VectorType::get(e,n)` created what is now a fixed vector type. With the addition of scalable types, it is recommended to use `FixedVectorType` and `ScalableVectorType` classes directly. Alternatively, there is a `VectorType::get` that accepts a 3rd parameter indicating whether the type should be fixed or scalable.\r\nUsing the older `VectorType::get` that implicitly assumes the fixed type is deprecated and LLVM now generates a warning.\r\n\r\nChange calls to `VectorType::get` to `FixedVectorType::get` to avoid compilation

submission\r\nThe idea is to create a TIR intrinsic `fixed_point_multiply` that can be overloaded (by the means of `tvm.target.intrin.register_intrin_rule`) and use AArch64 intrinsics (other vendors can provide their own implementation)\r\n\r\nThe TIR default intrinsic is registered in: `tvm/src/target/intrin_rule.cc`\r\nThe overload for AArch64 lives in

tutorial demonstrates how to load and run a sparse model from the popular transformers module from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) (🤗). Very recently a 95% sparse version of BERT was made publicly available however 🤗 was unable to achieve speedups using existing frameworks. Using this script, TVM enables a 2-3X speedup by converting appropriate dense layers to sparse dense layers. I think this will be a useful tutorial for user's interested in sparse networks and may be good PR for TVM as a small collaboration with 🤗.

all,\r\nThe last PR of Ansor #5883 is not clear enough for reviewers to fully understand our design. After some discussion, we changed our upstream plan to propose a minimal version of Ansor which contains a small but complete framework, so others can get a better understanding of the whole structure of Ansor.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\nIn [[RFC] Ansor: An Auto-scheduler for TVM (AutoTVM v2.0)](https://discuss.tvm.ai/t/rfc-ansor-an-auto-scheduler-for-tvm-autotvm-v2-0/7005), we've introduced the **Ansor** auto-scheduler. And we reached an agreement that should replace AutoTVM with Ansor in the end.\r\nFor most existing templates, current Ansor can directly replace them with better performance and less tuning time.\r\nFor other special templates (low-precision, sparse), the plan is to introduce search space customization and gradually rewrite them with Ansor's new API.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a self-contained minimum version of Ansor with most of the bones.\r\n\r\nThis PR includes the interface of core data structures and an empty search policy that does nothing. More advanced search policy and cost models will be in the next few PRs.\r\n\r\n# Infrastructure: A Sketch IR for Schedule Searching\r\nDifferent from AutoTVM, whose tuning spaces are composed of predefined parameters, Ansor constructs a search space by manipulating the loop structures of the given compute DAG.\r\nTo enable flexible manipulation of the loop structures, we implemented a lightweight loop structure IR (Intermediate Representation) based on the original TVM IR but specifically for schedule search. The IR is composed of the **state** and **action**, which are defined as follows:\r\n\r\n- **State**: A state of schedule search is the loop structure defined by the schedule (i.e., the TVM IR created by `tvm.lower`). See **LoopState** in the Key Data Structure for details.\r\n\r\n- **Action**: An action is composed of one or more schedule primitives to manipulate (e.g., split, reorder, fuse) a state. See **TransformStep** in the Key Data Structure for details.\r\n\r\nWe don't use the existing TVM IR but to extend a new Sketch IR on it is because:\r\n1. We want fast incremental change to the loop structures;\r\n2. We want serializable transform history for replay, backtracking, and mutation;\r\n3. We may create some macro schedule primitives that represent the combination of several TVM schedule primitives\r\n\r\nAfter the search is done, we will lower this to TVM IR with TVM schedule primitives.\r\n\r\n# Key Data Structures\r\nTo help build an overview of Ansor, this shows the class relations of some important Ansor data structures:\r\n<img width=\"1222\" alt=\"截屏2020-06-30 上午11 17 25\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12119698/86079551-55da9980-bac3-11ea-9f5f-d51e3dce5dfd.png\">\r\n\r\n- **ComputeDAG**: Compute declaration graph and its related analysis tools.\r\nRelated source files: `src/ansor/compute_dag.*`, `python/tvm/ansor/compute_dag.py`\r\nAnsor takes a compute declaration, which could be a single operator or a subgraph, described by `tvm.compute` as an input and converts it to a ComputeDAG.\r\nComputeDAG implementation includes a set of analyses such as the total float operations, consumer/producer relations of each operation stage, whether a stage should be tiled/compute inlined, and so on (*some of the analysis will be included in the follow-up PRs*). These analyses can help the search policy to do specific decisions during schedule search process.\r\n\r\n- **LoopState**: This defines the \"state\" for the search problem.\r\nRelated source files: `src/ansor/loop_state.*`, `python/tvm/ansor/loop_state.py`.\r\nEach LoopState corresponds to a specific schedule for the target ComputeDAG.\r\nA LoopState consists of: 1. the current loop structure; 2. the transform history to reach this loop structure.\r\nThe loop structure keeps a **preview** of how the schedule will finally look like after lowering (number of iterators, the extent of each iterator, the `compute_at` locations, etc), which can help the search policy to make decisions during the search.\r\nThe transform history is a sequence of `TransformStep` which will finally be mapped to schedule primitives.\r\n\r\n- **TransformStep**: This defines the \"action\" for the search problem, i.e., the schedule primitives for our sketch IR.\r\nRelated files: `src/ansor/transform_step.*`, `python/tvm/ansor/loop_state.py`\r\nEach step has its corresponding `tvm.te` schedule primitives. We record all TransformSteps for every state as its transform history. After finishing the schedule search, these transform steps will be lowered with their corresponding TVM's schedule primitives.\r\n*Note*: This PR only contains a small subset of the TransformSteps. The complete set of transform steps will be in the next PRs.\r\n\r\n> ComputeDAG is also playing a role of connecting Ansor state system to TVM schedule system. That is, ComputeDAG is able to replay TransformSteps to the final TVM schedule (e.g., `ComputeDAG(state, actions)`).\r\n\r\n- **SearchTask**: Meta information and hardware parameters for a specific schedule search task.\r\nRelated source files: `src/ansor/search_task.*`\r\nThis structure includes the target ComputeDAG, device information as well as some hardware parameters obtained from the system or user inputs.\r\n\r\n- **SearchPolicy**: The search policy is defined for Ansor to auto-generate a high-performance schedule for different computations.\r\nRelated source files: `src/ansor/search_policy/*`\r\nA SearchPolicy takes a `SearchTask`, system information and some tuning options as inputs, performs the schedule search, and returns a state with the best performance. The resulting state can be used to apply to TVM schedule later.\r\n\r\n  Note that in Ansor paper ([https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.06762](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.06762)), we proposed a sketch generation policy which achieves pretty good results with various workloads on different devices. On the other hand, in this minimum system PR, we only provide an `EmptyPolicy` to illustrate the search policy interface.\r\n\r\n# Ansor Minimum System\r\n\r\nThis is a brief diagram for the Ansor system:\r\n<img width=\"1481\" alt=\"截屏2020-06-30 上午10 44 59\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12119698/86077606-d3e87180-babe-11ea-8c3d-fe52c918db18.png\">\r\n\r\n1. Define the target computation with TVM `te` API and create a ComputeDAG structure.\r\n2. Specify the target device, hardware parameters, tuning options and pack those with `ComputeDAG` to create a `SearchTask` structure.\r\n3. `SearchPolicy` takes the `SearchTask` as input and performs the schedule search. During the search process, `SearchPolicy` will generate multiple candidate states, each of which corresponds to a specific TVM schedule.\r\n4. Get the best state and use ComputeDAG API to transform it to the final TVM schedule.\r\n\r\nIn the Ansor system, we use the sketch generation policy (will be brought in later PRs) described in the paper as the default search policy, which should be enough to cover most use cases. Meanwhile, we will have an RFC for a custom rule mechanism that enables user-defined template search to serve the same functionality as the current AutoTVM template. Specifically, we will provide Python APIs for the new IR that is intended to be used by users for sketch customization. They look very similar to existing schedule primitives, as shown in `python/tvm/ansor/loop_state.py`.\r\n\r\nOur goal is to make sure Ansor can cover all AutoTVM functionalities while achieving the same or better performance so that the community can gradually switch to Ansor from AutoTVM.\r\n\r\n# More Details on LoopState\r\n\r\nIn this section, we illustrate how a loop state looks like and how does it connect to the current TVM build system.\r\n\r\nTake a simple State that includes Split, Fuse and Reorder steps for example:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nA, B, C = matmul_ansor_test(512, 512, 512)\r\ndag = ansor.ComputeDAG([A, B, C])\r\nstate = dag.get_init_state()\r\ni, j, k = state[C].iters\r\nio, ii = state.split(C, i, [16])\r\njo, ji = state.split(C, j, [8])\r\nstate.reorder(C, [io, jo, k, ji, ii])\r\nfused_it = state.fuse(C, [io, jo])\r\n```\r\n\r\nFirst, let's print out a state. It shows the loop structure of the corresponding TVM schedule, the \"preview\":\r\n```python\r\n>>> print(state)\r\n\r\nPlaceholder: A, B\r\nfor i.0@j.0@ (0,2048)\r\n  for k (0,512)\r\n    for j.1 (0,8)\r\n      for i.1 (0,16)\r\n        C = ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt stores all history transform steps required to reach the current state. We can print the history transform steps as TVM's python schedule API. This can be used for debugging or to apply the schedule on a former TVM version without Ansor support.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> print(dag.print_python_code_from_state(state))\r\n\r\ni, j, k = tuple(C.op.axis) + tuple(C.op.reduce_axis)\r\ni_o, i_i = s[C].split(i, factor=16)\r\nj_o, j_i = s[C].split(j, factor=8)\r\ns[C].reorder(i_o, j_o, k, j_i, i_i)\r\ni_o_j_o_fused = s[C].fuse(i_o, j_o)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can also replay these steps to get a schedule for `tvm.lower` and `tvm.build`.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> sche, args = dag.apply_steps_from_state(state)\r\n>>> print(tvm.lower(sche, args, simple_mode=True))\r\n\r\nprimfn(A_1: handle, B_1: handle, C_1: handle) -> ()\r\n  attr = {\"global_symbol\": \"main\", \"tir.noalias\": True}\r\n  buffers = {C: Buffer(C_2: handle, float32, [512, 512], []),\r\n             A: Buffer(A_2: handle, float32, [512, 512], []),\r\n             B: Buffer(B_2: handle, float32, [512, 512], [])}\r\n  buffer_map = {A_1: A, B_1: B, C_1: C} {\r\n  for (i.outer.j.outer.fused: int32, 0, 2048) {\r\n    for (j.inner.init: int32, 0, 8) {\r\n      for (i.inner.init: int32, 0, 16) {\r\n        C_2[((((floordiv(i.outer.j.outer.fused, 64)*8192) + (i.inner.init*512)) + (floormod(i.outer.j.outer.fused, 64)*8)) + j.inner.init)] = 0f32\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n    for (k: int32, 0, 512) {\r\n      for (j.inner: int32, 0, 8) {\r\n        for (i.inner: int32, 0, 16) {\r\n          C_2[((((floordiv(i.outer.j.outer.fused, 64)*8192) + (i.inner*512)) + (floormod(i.outer.j.outer.fused, 64)*8)) + j.inner)] = ((float32*)C_2[((((floordiv(i.outer.j.outer.fused, 64)*8192) + (i.inner*512)) + (floormod(i.outer.j.outer.fused, 64)*8)) + j.inner)]) + ((float32*)A_2[(((floordiv(i.outer.j.outer.fused, 64)*8192) + (i.inner*512)) + k)])*(float32*)B_2[(((k*512) + (floormod(i.outer.j.outer.fused, 64)*8)) + j.inner)])))\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe steps of this state can be serialized into the log file as:\r\n```python\r\n>>> target = tvm.target.create(\"llvm\")\r\n>>> task = ansor.SearchTask(dag, \"test\", target)\r\n>>> inp = ansor.measure.MeasureInput(task, state)\r\n>>> res = ansor.measure.MeasureResult([0.1], 0, \"\", 0.2, 1)\r\n>>> with open(\"test.log\", \"w\") as fp:\r\n>>>     ansor.serialization.write_measure_records_to_file(fp.name, [inp], [res])\r\n\r\n{\"i\": [[\"test\", \"llvm\"], [[], [[\"SP\", 2, 0, 512, [16], 1], [\"SP\", 2, 2, 512, [8], 1], [\"RE\", 2, [0, 2, 4, 3, 1]], [\"FU\", 2, [0, 1]]]]], \"r\": [[0.1], 0, 0.2, 1], \"v\": \"v0.2\"}\r\n```\r\nAnsor serializes all transform steps to the log file; while AutoTVM serializes parameters of a predefined template. The log format discussion would be based on https://discuss.tvm.ai/t/rfc-canonicalizing-autotvm-log-format/7038/.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIn the next few PRs, we'll introduce the complete search policy and tutorials for single op/ subgraph schedule search, Relay integration, and tutorials for end-to-end network schedule search, custom rules to support customized search space.\r\n\r\nThis is a joint work

are useful primitives to create variable bindings.\r\nWhile let binding are harmful for simplification and integer analysis(due to the indirection), they are useful for other cases:\r\n\r\n- C0: LetStmt is useful to represent a step that has side effect(e.g. call a PRNG)\r\n- C1: Let expression can be used to create deep nested expression for complicated functions.\r\n\r\nThis PR improves the let support in the following ways:\r\n- Enable vectorization support for let\r\n- Change let simplification strategy to simplify the most trivial case\r\n  while ignore more complicated cases(to avoid deep nest explosion)\r\n- Enhance arith module to handle const bound and modular set for let.\r\n\r\nWe also relaxed the SSA checking conditions for Let expression, to allow the same var to be binded multiple times, as long as their binding value are equal to each other.\r\n\r\nThe overall recommendation is to only use Let in the cases when necessary(C0, C1).\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2020-06-28T00:09:07Z","updated_at":"2020-07-20T15:52:54Z","closed_at":"2020-06-28T16:22:12Z","merged_at":"2020-06-28T16:22:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"4fbfaca5fc417b09330f7592b21efdc6fb1cf51b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/5949/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/5949/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/5949/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/823f5dedc3e6bd6e0f195eea55d660e945dba756","head":{"label":"tqchen:let","ref":"let","sha":"823f5dedc3e6bd6e0f195eea55d660e945dba756","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":100638323,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDA2MzgzMjM=","name":"tvm","full_name":"tqchen/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen/tvm","description":null,"fork":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm","forks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/forks","keys_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/keys{/key_id}","collaborators_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/collaborators{/collaborator}","teams_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/teams","hooks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/hooks","issue_events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/issues/events{/number}","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/events","assignees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/assignees{/user}","branches_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/branches{/branch}","tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/tags","blobs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/blobs{/sha}","git_tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/tags{/sha}","git_refs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/refs{/sha}","trees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/trees{/sha}","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/statuses/{sha}","languages_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/languages","stargazers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/stargazers","contributors_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/contributors","subscribers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/subscribers","subscription_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/subscription","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/commits{/sha}","git_commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/commits{/sha}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/comments{/number}","issue_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/issues/comments{/number}","contents_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/contents/{+path}","compare_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/compare/{base}...{head}","merges_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/merges","archive_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/{archive_format}{/ref}","downloads_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tv

finally lower to wrong CUDA C instructions.\r\nThis should be simplified to generate the correct RampNode:\r\n```\r\nA.shared[ramp(((ax0.ax1.fused.outer.outer*256) + (threadIdx.x_1*4)), 1, 4)]

there's any better way to check if all of the inner AST blocks are RampNode, the current UTs I added can still pass even if the vectorize failed.\r\n\r\ncc @minminsun @FrozenGene

discussion: https://discuss.tvm.ai/t/byoc-runtime-json-runtime-for-byoc/6579\r\n\r\nCurrently, BYOC allows developers to choose either C source module or their customized module as the runtime for their accelerators. While we have provided an end-to-end execution flow of DNNL (i.e., MKL-DNN, OneDNN) using C source module, we found that many developers prefer to use a customized module to better integrate to their own runtime engine, such as TensorRT. As a result, this PR (collaborating with @zhiics) provides an end-to-end flow of DNNL using JSON runtime. Some detail highlights:\r\n\r\n* We provide JSON codegen and JSON runtime base classes. JSON codegen serializes a Relay subgaph to a JSON file; while JSON runtime base provides deserialization methods to interprete subgraphs in JSON format. Developers can derive JSON codegen to easily customize their codegen, or even directly use JSON codegen if their runtime engine accepts standard TVM graph runtime JSON.\r\n\r\n* We make a case study of leveraging JSON runtime with DNNL. The DNNL JSON runtime now supports conv2d, dense, relu, batch_norm, and add. As a result, it is able to run MobileNet. Note that DNNL JSON runtime only creates one DNNL execution engine for a subgraph, so it is much more efficient compared to the C source module version, which creates a DNNL engine for each *operator* in a subgraph.\r\n\r\n* DNNL JSON runtime handles constant tensors following the new mechanism in #5770.\r\n\r\n* DNNL codegen with C source module will be preserved for illustraction purpose, and we use cmake to control which DNNL codegen should be used. Specifically, `USE_DNNL_CODEGEN ON` and `USE_DNNL_CODEGEN JSON` enable the JSON runtime (and this is the default runtime for DNNL). When following the tutorial, which we will update after this PR, users may use `USE_DNNL_CODEGEN C_SRC` to enable C source module so that they can learn how it work.\r\n\r\n### Evaluation\r\n\r\nThis PR doesn't push the inference performance with the DNNL codegen/runtime. While we leave the issues as the future work, here we list some performance issues we have observed.\r\n\r\n1. `write_to_dnnl_memory` performs memory copy from DLTensor (NDArray) to DNNL memory. This can be avoided by specifying NDArray pointer when creating a DNNL memory. (~5 ms overhead to MobileNet V2).\r\n\r\n2. We should set `OMP_NUM_THREADS` wisely. For example, MobileNet V2 with `batch_norm` simplified achieves 1400 ms on c5.2xlarge. However, if we run it with `OMP_NUM_THREADS=16`, then the latency dropped to 65 ms.\r\n  - Baseline: 1400 ms.\r\n  - With `OMP_NUM_THREADS=16`: 65 ms.\r\n\r\n3. We should not assign the output layout to conv2d. The default output layout of DNNL conv2d is NHWC. If we assign the output layout to be NCHW, then it will perform layout transform after the computation. Instead, we should let DNNL use the layout it prefers, and only assign the layout to the last operator.\r\n  - Baseline: 1400 ms.\r\n  - Unassigned layout: 131 ms.\r\n  - Unassigned layout with `OMP_NUM_THREADS=16`: 16 ms.\r\n\r\nIn summary, if we resolve all issue mentioned above, the inference performance of MoibleNet V2 on c5.2xlarge should be 16 - 5 =11 ms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncc @masahi

Compute Library (ACL) integration using the BYOC infrastructure. This will enable offloading select operators from a relay graph to ACL so we can achieve faster inference times on Arm CPU's due to hand crafted optimized routines. The PR adds initial support for offloading FP32 conv2d, maxpool2d and reshape to ACL. ACL codegen is used to generate a JSON representation of an operator or 'ACL layer', the ACL runtime then uses this representation to construct a layer, cache it and create a packed\r\nfunction to for
