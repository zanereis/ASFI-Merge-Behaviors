PR modifies `DruidProcessingConfig` property `druid.processing.buffer.sizeBytes` to compute a reasonable default based on the amount of direct memory, number of processing threads, and number of merge buffers instead of using a fixed 1GiB default buffer size. This should be much more friendly behavior out of the box, ensuring reasonably efficient usage of direct memory resources provided to the process, without interfering with operators who still wish to fine tune such things.\r\n\r\nOn process startup, `DruidProcessingModule` does a check:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmemoryNeeded = druid.processing.buffer.sizeBytes * (druid.processing.numMergeBuffers + druid.processing.numThreads + 1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nto validate that the process has been given enough direct memory. Configs for `numThreads` and `numMergeBuffers` produce reasonable defaults if not manually set, but `sizeBytes` has a fixed default size of 1G, which may or may not work depending on the direct memory settings and core count. This formula is shifted around to produce a default value for `sizeBytes`. I'm not certain this is actually the optimal formula, since having a lot of merge buffers effectively eats into the amount of space reserved for things like decompressing blocks of segments, while the increased number of merge buffers increases the processing throughput of simultaneous group-by queries, which is a sort of conflict, but I think adjustments can be made in a future PR.\r\n\r\nchanges:\r\n* `DruidProcessingConfig.intermediateComputeSizeBytes()` now computes a default value based on `-XX:MaxDirectMemorySize`\r\n* Introduces `RuntimeInfo` class that wraps `Runtime.getRuntime()` to expose available processors and memory sizing information, mostly to allow control over these things in unit tests without setting flags on the jvm process, but it also nicely consolidates this stuff I guess?\r\n* `org.apache.druid.common.utils.VMUtils` has been moved and renamed `org.apache.druid.utils.JvmUtils` which has a static injected `RuntimeInfo` which is

approach to what was taken in #6547, instead embedding the `BloomKFilter` implementation in `druid-bloom-filters` extension, applying a fix from [HIVE-20893](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-20893) and wrapping `BYTE_ARRAY_4` which is re-used instead of re-allocated per function call, for ints/floats, with `ThreadLocal` to fix the thread safety issues. \r\n\r\nFixes #6546\r\n\r\nThe copied `BloomKFilter` is from `hive-storage-api` as of verison 2.7.0 instead of master, since [this commit](https://github.com/apache/hive/commit/87ce36b458350db141c4cb4b6336a9a01796370f#diff-e65fc506757ee058dc951d15a9a526c3L238) seems to have broken backwards compatibility by using 8 bytes instead of 4 to store and test ints/floats. I went with this version specifically to maintain compatibility with the hive version used in the original PR, #6222, despite I think the latest implementation being a bit better since it doesn't use the static variable.\r\n\r\nThe copied implementation should be removed once the linked hive ticket is resolved and the fix is released so we can update `hive-storage-api`.","created_at":"2018-11-07T05:26:32Z","updated_at":"2018-11-13T17:50:40Z","closed_at":"2018-11-09T18:55:18Z","merged_at":"2018-11-09T18:55:17Z","merge_commit_sha":"c2f020eacc318a0dc5501209922b5b93a17c91fa","assignee":{"login":"jihoonson","id":2322288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjIyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2322288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson","html_url":"https://github.com/jihoonson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"jihoonson","id":2322288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjIyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2322288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson","html_url":"https://github.com/jihoonson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jihoonson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/25","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/milestone/25","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/25/labels","id":3023864,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMzAyMzg2NA==","number":25,"title":"0.13.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"leventov","id":609240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwOTI0MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/609240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov","html_url":"https://github.com/leventov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":492,"state":"closed","created_at":"2018-01-09T18:30:01Z","updated_at":"2019-01-10T17:19:08Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2019-01-10T17:19:08Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/6584/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/6584/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/6584/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/statuses/7ee7fb887fdd26bf4ffc63905777b3e2711793f5","head":{"label":"clintropolis:bloom-filter-not-threadsafe","ref":"bloom-filter-not-threadsafe","sha":"7ee7fb887fdd26bf4ffc63905777b3e2711793f5","user":{"login":"clintropolis","id":1577461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Nzc0NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1577461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis","html_url":"https://github.com/clintropolis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clintropolis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.gith

pull request for a druid aggregation extension that supports the moments sketch. The moments sketch is a compact, efficiently mergeable approximate quantile sketch. This extension wraps the library available here: https://github.com/stanford-futuredata/momentsketch . The post aggregator can be used to extract quantile estimates from the aggregator.\r\n\r\nThe aggregator is parameterized by k, the size of the sketch, and a boolean parameter \"compress\" which will

current Druid setup does batch ingestion of data, which uses \"indexing-hadoop\" tasks for ingestion. So I observe \"Unable to rename ******\" exception daily indexing tasks and frequency increases when I run data back-filling/correction tasks for some interval of say 1 month. So I came up with a fix by applying a logic that while creating a file on S3 for first time create it with expected name i.e. \"index.zip\" (in place of index.zip.0) and avoid rename(index.zip.0 -> index.zip) completely, because \"create\" part never fails but \"rename\" does intermittently. With this I did not came across \"Unable to rename ******\" exception so far (past 2 months - till date)\r\n\r\nIt is possible that this proposed fix is not very broad sighted, but looking at HDFS API only part I think we should be able to avoid this annoying issue of \"Unable to rename\", which may arise despite one having all correct EC2, S3 permissions

PR fixes an issue where an exception thrown by a `Supervisor.start()` implementation can wreck the leadership lifecycle start of `SupervisorManager` which in turn wrecks `TaskMaster` start, prevent any overlord from obtaining leadership.\r\n\r\nObserved in a test cluster with a custom kinesis indexing extension, which was broken by recent changes to core druid in which `aws-java-sdk` dependencies are pulled in as well as a version bump, resulting in the custom extension expecting some jars to be provided that no longer are, and of a different version. Anyway, it's failure to start caused the cluster to be without any functioning overlord, which doesn't seem the most chill behavior. After this patch, failing supervisor starts will be logged at error level, but the `SupervisorManager` will still attempt to start any remaining supervisors, allowing the overlord to continue functioning in a partially degraded state instead of not at all. Similar in spirit to issue and fix of #6512\r\n\r\nRelevant logs:\r\n```\r\n2018-10-25T04:34:43,537 ERROR [LeaderSelector[/demo/overlord/_OVERLORD]] org.apache.druid.curator.discovery.CuratorDruidLeaderSelector - listener becomeLeader() failed.

when users use the `RandomBalancerStrategy` at Coordinator, there is no implementation to rebalance the segments which alreay exist on the Historical server. For example, if a new historical node is add to a druid cluster which already has much data on historical nodes, the used percentage of new historical node willl be much less than avg used percentage of the whole cluster for a long time. So I add an implementation for `RandomBalancerStrategy` to rebalance the data.\r\n\r\nThe basic idea is compare the used percentage of every historical node with  avg used percentage of whole cluster.

PR adds bloom filter support to druid sql queries for use in where clauses, introducing a new sql operator, `BLOOM_FILTER_TEST` which takes an dimension expression and a base64 encoded, serialized bloom filter to construct a `BloomDimFilter`. Expression virtual columns are not yet supported as the `dimension` parameter, only direct column references or simple extractions.\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT COUNT(*) FROM druid.foo WHERE bloom_filter_test(<dimension>, '<serialized_bytes_for_BloomKFilter>')\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nWith very large bloom filters, I experienced slow planning times, which I believe to be related to tokenization/parsing of the large sql expression, so it is of note that this may be significantly slower than using native druid json queries, and with a much larger heap footprint due to planner overhead, but it's a start. For large filters, sql expressions may not be suitable until a mechanism to bypass having the large value in the sql string is in place, such as parameter binding or some other form of variable replacement. \r\n\r\nI think we also want to investigate further performance improvements to query planning, as being able to cache `DimFilter` artifacts per plan, or lazily constructing actual druid query objects at execution time would be a significant improvement for the bloom filter in particular, as it could avoid deserializing the large input into a `BloomDimFilter` multiple times, greatly reducing the amount of time spent planning as well as garbage produced.\r\n\r\nTo support allowing extensions to define filters for sql, `druid-sql` has been slightly refactored, with the `SqlOperatorConversion` interface expanded to include a new method `toDruidFilter` which is analogous to `toDruidExpression` but produces a `DimFilter` instead. This allows filter expression parsing to use any `SqlOperatorConversion` in the operators table that produces a non-null filter. \r\n\r\nAs such, `LIKE` has been refactored from being a special case matched on `SqlKind` into `LikeOperatorConversion` which implements `toDruidFilter`. `LikeOperatorConversion` is the only built-in `SqlOperatorConversion` that implements `toDruidFilter`, additional \"filters\" such as '=' and comparisons are handled with specialty code in the filter expression parsing logic, but I suspect they could probably be translated to implement `toDruidFilter` instead in a future PR.\r\n\r\nAdditionally a base sql query test class was extracted from `CalciteQueryTest` to allow code-reuse for the bloom filter sql

PR adds support for transactional kafka by updating kafka version to latest and modifying code to support this. Found that integration-tests had a dependency on `druid-kafka-eight` which is removed now as well as the integration test for kafka firehose. Kafka-eight uses `ConsumerConnector` which is removed from latest version of kafka, so this module is incompatible with latest kafka version as is. One option is to fix it to work with latest versions or remove it (as was attempted before with #5841). So with this PR, I am only removing the integration test and deprecating `kafka-eight`. We might want to remove it completely if it's unused and no one wants to keep it.\r\n\r\n* update kafka version to latest v2.0.1\r\n* Remove the skipOffsetGaps option since it's not used or required anymore\r\n* Adjust kafka consumer to use transactional semantics\r\n* Remove `kafka-eight` integration test \r\n* Deprecate `kafka-eight` module classes\r\n* Update tests\r\n* Update

the entire AWS SDK bundle\r\n\r\nWhen trying to push the 0.13 RC1 binary to the Apache repository, I was getting rejected, likely due to the file being too large (it was 385MB). While investigating the bloat, I found two major factors:\r\n\r\n- As a result of #6162, all distribution builds were bundling all the contrib extensions\r\n- As a result of #5382, we switched to pulling in the entire AWS SDK bundle instead of just the required modules\r\n\r\nI fixed the first one by splitting off a separate `bundle-contrib-exts` profile as previous which can be used to add the contrib extensions; otherwise only the core extensions are bundled.\r\n\r\nFor the second one, I removed the dependency on `aws-java-sdk-bundle` and only pulled `aws-java-sdk-ec2` and `aws-java-sdk-s3`. I am not sure if the full bundle was pulled in for any particular reason or just as a convenience.\r\n\r\nI also excluded a few larger dependencies from extensions that were already included in the core.\r\n\r\nBinary tarball reduced in size from 385MB to 210MB.\r\n\r\nFYI, I am still waiting on a response to a JIRA ticket to Apache Legal regarding how the MySQL connector should be packaged: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LEGAL-423. If I don't hear back soon, I'll try to push RC1 (for the third time!) and do an RC2 if they express concerns with our current packaging system. My hunch is that we will be required to separate the offending library (GPL-licensed Java MySQL connector library) from the rest of the MySQL extension.. so if others feel good about it, I wouldn't be

objects with large `maxNumEntries` can be sized in the tens to hundreds of megabytes. Requests this size already put significant pressure on the heap, but having giant cache keys is brutal.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes `BloomDimFilter` to deserialize the `bloomKFilter` property into a `BloomKFilterHolder` in order to both deserialize the `BloomKFilter` and compute a `sha512` hash from the raw filter bytes to be used for a cache key.\r\n\r\nFor an example using a 10 million entry bloom filter, cache key size in bytes shrinks from 7794075 bytes to 86 bytes.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this PR changes `BloomDimFilter.toString` and `BloomDimFilter.equals` to use the `hash` value instead of the `BloomKFilter`, which does not have it's own overrides for `equals` and whose `toString` only prints the size of the filter.\r\n\r\nWe may want to consider modifying `CacheKeyBuilder` to always compute a hash for a cache key if over a certain threshold, but not in this PR, which I think will still want to deserialize the value in this manner so as to not have to re-serialize in order to

changes to POM files to prepare for Apache release:\r\n\r\n- Change parent POM from `io.druid:oss-parent` to `org.apache:apache` and port over some of the configurations/profiles from `oss-parent`\r\n- Generate source artifact\r\n  - Notably, exclude the items under the `publications` directory\r\n- Generate SHA-512 and GPG armored detached signature files\r\n- Generate `git.version` file and include in both source and binary tarballs\r\n  - Primary motivation for this is that in Apache's release process, the final RC becomes the GA release, so artifacts in the tarball can't be RC versioned, e.g. RC1 would have `druid-server-0.13.0-incubating.jar` and not `druid-server-0.13.0-incubating-rc1.jar`. The git metadata in `git.version` should help to trace where the artifacts were built from.\r\n- Include DISCLAIMER file in tarballs\r\n\r\n- The primary output artifacts will look like this:\r\n  -

are conducting a scientific study to investigate bad practices/anti-patterns on creating micro-benchmarks using JMH, and we found an instance of harmfull usage of Invocation level in `LoadStatusBenchmark`.\r\n\r\nThe usage of Invocation level for JMH fixture methods (setup/teardown) inccurs in a significant impact in\r\nin the benchmark time (see [JMH Documentation](http://hg.openjdk.java.net/code-tools/jmh/file/66fb723292d4/jmh-samples/src/main/java/org/openjdk/jmh/samples/JMHSample_07_FixtureLevelInvocation.java)). \r\n\r\nWhen benchmark and setup/teardown is too small (less than a milisecond) the Invocation level might saturate the system with timestamp requests and iteration synchronizations which introduce artificial latency, throughput, and scalability bottlenecks.\r\n\r\n**Modification:**\r\nI moved the code that doesn't need to be created on every invocation into a setup with Trial level.\r\n\r\n**Results**\r\nIn all our tests, benchmarks run faster now (from 30-50%), without the high JMH Overhead.  \r\nI am reporting the result of 5 full executions with default parameters (iterations, forks, warmups, etc..)\r\n\r\n[druid-fixed-antipatters-invo.zip](https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/files/2474082/druid-fixed-antipatters-invo.zip)\r\n\r\nEnvironment:\r\nTests run on a Computational server

towards #4312, retrying what #5490 was attempting.\r\n\r\nThis PR is strictly moving files into a `druid-core` library/folder structure and fixing up `pom.xml` files to change all references of `druid-api`, `druid-common`, and `java-util` to `druid-core`. I have not combined `druid-processing` to try to limit the extent of interference with existing PRs. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, I have not refactored file package placement or any of the other cleanup this move allows, which I think can be done in a follow up PR, to minimize reviewer mental cost.\r\n\r\nPassing unit and integration tests for me and everything appears to be functioning, but I did have to add a log4j xml file to integration tests project, I have no idea what sort of magic was being done before, but I suspected it was related to the problems ran into #5490 too.

Major changes to review\r\n- `SeekableStreamSupervisor` and Kafka/Kinesis implementation classes\r\n- `SeekableStreamIndexTask` and Kafka/Kinesis  implementation classes\r\n- `SeekableStreamIndexTaskRunner` and Kafka/Kinesis  implementation classes\r\n- `RecordSupplier` and Kafka/Kinesis implementation classes\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nThe motivation for this PR is to add `kinesis-indexing-service` to core druid extensions and provide an abstraction `seekablestream` for streaming systems with the following characteristics:\r\n- **Seekable**: ability to seek to a specific point in the stream - so that we can store the offsets transactionally in an external system to ensure correctness and can return to a specific record if we need to retry after a failure\r\n- **Partition-able**: so that ingestion can be scaled out and handled by multiple indexing tasks\r\n- **Partition-ordered**: so that we have deterministic results from replica tasks that are independently reading the same partition\r\n\r\n## Major changes\r\n- Merged identical Kafka/Kinesis supervisor/task logic into common abstract classes\r\n- Created the RecordSupplier abstraction instead of using Kafka/Kinesis client APIs directly\r\n- Implemented incremental handoff and checkpointing for Kinesis\r\n- Introduced abstractions to avoid working with Kafka/Kinesis specific implementations like partition, shard, offsets, sequence number, shardIterators etc. directly\r\n- unit test coverage for Kinesis \r\n\r\n~~The logic in `KinesisIndexTask` and `KafkaIndexTask` has not been merged yet, due to Kinesis not yet supporting incremental handoff, but this will be implemented in a follow-up PR. The code in the two index tasks are left as is for now.~~\r\n\r\nincremental handoff in now implemented for Kinesis Index Task\r\n\r\n~~The unit tests for Kinesis depends on [LocalStack](https://github.com/localstack/localstack), a local AWS testing stack, which requires a **running Docker** instance~~\r\n\r\ndocker dependency is no longer required as mocks are used instead\r\n\r\n## Definition of Abstractions\r\n\r\n### `SeekableStreamSupervisor`\r\nmerged the logic from KinesisSupervisor and KafkaSupervisor, most notably the logic in `runInternal()` and the helper methods. \r\n\r\n### `RecordSupplier`\r\nabstraction for fetching records from Kafka Server/Kinesis Stream. The implementation for Kafka is trivial as Kafka provides a `KafkaConsumer` which basically encapsulates all of the logic. KinesisRecordSupplier on the other hand is a full-fledged buffer implementation.\r\n\r\n### `SeekableStreamIndexTaskRunner`\r\nmerged logic from KinesisIndexTask (which didn't have the TaskRunner abstraction) and IncrementalPublishingKafkaTaskRunner. There is a slight discrepancy in fetching the next sequence number/offset in which the kafka task will read from starting offset (inclusive) to end offset (exclusive) while the Kinesis task reads from start sequence number (inclusive for 1st task, exclusive for all subsequent tasks) to end sequence number (inclusive). This is because Kinesis sequence numbers cannot be calculated simply like Kafka's, so instead of making an expensive API call to get the next sequence number, we store the current-already-read-to sequence number instead.\r\n\r\n### `OrderedPartitionableRecord`, `SeekableStreamPartition`, `SeekableStreamPartitions`\r\nabstractions over the Kafka/Kinesis partition/shard, offset/sequence number concepts. These classes help to avoid working with Kafka/Kinesis specific types directly\r\n\r\n## Compatibility with other streaming systems\r\nThis abstract design is specifically aimed at partition-able, partition-ordered stream systems such as Kafka and Kinesis. Systems that do not have partitions or do not offer ordering within partitions are not good fits under this abstraction.

gauge `emitter/buffers/failed` and `emitter/buffers/totalAllocated` metrics proved to be very inconvenient in practice: they are not additive across a fleet of nodes, are randomly reset when a JVM restarts (that may be completely independent from metrics emitting issues). Regarding [problem identification](https://github.com/apache/incubator-druid/pull/4973#issuecomment-338119125), `emitter/buffers/dropped` serves this well.\r\n\r\nCurrently in this PR I added `/delta` vs. `/total` metrics, but if there are no objections I would remove `/total` and so align `emitter/buffers/allocated` and `/failed` with `/dropped` and `/events/emitted` which are already delta-only.","created_at":"2018-10-05T16:33:35Z","updated_at":"2019-02-20T01:16:23Z","closed_at":"2018-10-15T20:30:30Z","merged_at":"2018-10-15T20:30:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"b57d5df07479174f9a8bbbab7b131040457ce6c6","assignee":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":297508895,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyOTc1MDg4OTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Release%20Notes","name":"Release
