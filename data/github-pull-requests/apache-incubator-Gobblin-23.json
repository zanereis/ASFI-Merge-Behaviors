is an overhaul of record processing in ETL tasks in Gobblin. The major changes are:\r\n\r\n* Make record metadata a first-class citizen of Gobblin. Instead of passing raw records around the pipeline, it now uses `RecordEnvelope`s containing the record, metadata, and relevant callbacks. `RecordEnvelope`s are transparent to all constructs that don't care about them.\r\n* Callbacks are first-class citizens. Each record has a collection of callbacks that get called whenever the record is written, dropped, or failed. Any construct can add callbacks to the record.\r\n* The processing of records is based on java `Stream`s instead of a synchronous record-by-record processing. This will allow, in the future, to do async/out-of-order record processing.","created_at":"2017-05-08T16:42:53Z","updated_at":"2017-06-13T15:44:49Z","closed_at":"2017-06-13T15:44:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d11b4ed462ce7e14d4b771b3749b4cb971678f77","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/1839/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/1839/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/1839/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/7359e5aad3ab63efe2d0eae6f35d9f09c9d64e54","head":{"label":"ibuenros:record-streaming","ref":"record-streaming","sha":"7359e5aad3ab63efe2d0eae6f35d9f09c9d64e54","user":{"login":"ibuenros","id":1364112,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQxMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1364112?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros","html_url":"https://github.com/ibuenros","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":33570608,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzU3MDYwOA==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"ibuenros/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ibuenros","id":1364112,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQxMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1364112?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros","html_url":"https://github.com/ibuenros","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ibuenros/gobblin","description":null,"fork":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin","forks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/forks","keys_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/keys{/key_id}","collaborators_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/collaborators{/collaborator}","teams_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/teams","hooks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/hooks","issue_events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/issues/events{/number}","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/events","assignees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/assignees{/user}","branches_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/branches{/branch}","tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/tags","blobs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/git/blobs{/sha}","git_tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/git/tags{/sha}","git_refs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/git/refs{/sha}","trees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/git/trees{/sha}","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/statuses/{sha}","languages_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/languages","stargazers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/stargazers","contributors_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/contributors","subscribers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/subscribers","subscription_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/subscription","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/commits{/sha}","git_commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/git/commits{/sha}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/comments{/number}","issue_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/issues/comments{/number}","contents_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/contents/{+path}","compare_url":"https://api.g

PR is 95% around throttling server HA, with some other changes that were used in previous attempts at HA but are useful either way.\r\n\r\nThe general idea of HA is as follows:\r\n* Multiple Throttling servers coordinate through Zookeeper to elect a leader.\r\n* Any request to a non-leader returns a 301 redirect to the leader.\r\n* Clients use as input a list of URIs in the cluster (in the future will use D2 uri instead) and chose an initial URI at random.\r\n* Clients transparently process 301 redirects and repeat the request to the new leader up to a maximum number of redirects. The redirect is sticky, i.e. the client remembers the active leader, and all future requests will go to that leader (until a new redirect is received).\r\n* If the client cannnot connect to the stored host, it resets by round-robin'ing over the list of input URIs.\r\n\r\nMajor changes:\r\n===========\r\nServer side\r\n----------\r\n* Introduction of `LeaderFinder`, an interface allowing a cluster of processes to elect a leader, and allowing each process to get metadata on the leader.\r\n* Introduction of `ZookeeperLeaderElection`, a `LeaderFinder` based on Zookeeper leader election.\r\n* The `ThrottlingGuiceServletConfig`, which is the `ServletContextListener` used to configure the throttling server, was changed to automatically instantiate a `LeaderFinder` if a zk string is provided. Also, it becomes stateful even when not launching through a servlet (for example, when launching through `EmbeddedRestliServer`.\r\n\r\nClient side\r\n----------\r\n* Introduction/refining of `RequestSender`, which abstracts the sending of a `PermitRequest` to the throttling server. This also allows easily injecting Mock servers for testing.\r\n* `RestClientRequestSender` uses a `RestClient` to send a permit request.\r\n* `RedirectAwareRestClientRequestSender` is a `RequestSender` than transparently handles redirects, sticky routing, and failures to communicate with the current stored uri.\r\n* `ExponentialBackoff` is a class used to implement generic exponential backoff. Put it in gobblin-utility because it is not the first time I wish we had one of these.","created_at":"2017-04-26T16:21:06Z","updated_at":"2017-05-01T18:06:40Z","closed_at":"2017-05-01T18:06:38Z","merged_at":"2017-05-01T18:06:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"7aaeabbe0395b821d28cf9fbc55ea07444474373","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/1809/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/1809/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/1809/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/f5bcfdfd12550737bc6252f1011a3a25a99da548","head":{"label":"ibuenros:throttling-ha","ref":"throttling-ha","sha":"f5bcfdfd12550737bc6252f1011a3a25a99da548","user":{"login":"ibuenros","id":1364112,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQxMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1364112?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros","html_url":"https://github.com/ibuenros","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":33570608,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzU3MDYwOA==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"ibuenros/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ibuenros","id":1364112,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQxMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1364112?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros","html_url":"https://github.com/ibuenros","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ibuenros/gobblin","description":null,"fork":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin","forks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/forks","keys_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/keys{/key_id}","collaborators_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/collaborators{/collaborator}","teams_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/teams","hooks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/hooks","issue_events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/issues/events{/number}","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/events","assignees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/assignees{/user}","branches_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/branches{/branch}","tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/tags","blobs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/git/blobs{/sha}","git_tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/git/tags{/sha}","git_refs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/git/refs{/sha}","trees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/git/trees{/sha}","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/statuses/{sha}","languages_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/languages","stargazers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/stargazers","contributors_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/contributors","subscribers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/subscribers","subscription_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/subscription","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/commits{/sha}","git_commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/git/commits{/sha}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/comments{/number}","issue_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/issues/comments{/number}","contents_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/contents/{+path}","compare_url":"https:

are two main sets of changes in this PR:\r\n\r\nStres Test for Throttling\r\n=================\r\n\r\n* There are two stress tests: `MRStressTest` and `LocalStressTest`.\r\n* A `Stressor` is a class that sends requests to a `Limiter`. Different stressors can simulate different usage patterns.\r\n* The `LocalStressTest` uses and embedded throttling server and multiple threads to run a stressor. The requests do not go through the network, but the stress test can add artificial latency representing the network latency. Every 15 seconds, the stress test logs statistics about the throttling.\r\n* The `MRStressTest` uses a real throttling server. It spawns multiple mappers each one running a stressor. The mappers emit their effective permit use rate every 15 seconds, which then gets collected by the reducer to compute the global effective QPS every 15 seconds.\r\n\r\nThrottling algorithm updates\r\n=====================\r\n\r\n* Some changes to the batching algorithm. The previous algorithm was keeping the permit requests open for a long time (~7 seconds under high contention) because it allowed up to 7 seconds to acquire even a small number of permits. The new algorithm uses a short timeout instead, generally just short enough to satisfy the minimum number of permits requested. Larger permit allocations only happen if there are permits stored (meaning low contention).","created_at":"2017-04-17T23:20:47Z","updated_at":"2017-04-18T22:44:22Z","closed_at":"2017-04-18T22:44:19Z","merged_at":"2017-04-18T22:44:19Z","merge_commit_sha":"99fd5ef6707ff7f961efc3630589f21d05d7f663","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/1779/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/1779/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/1779/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/d4febf831bf03c9ff08d6a873cbdcef08ffb871b","head":{"label":"ibuenros:stresstest","ref":"stresstest","sha":"d4febf831bf03c9ff08d6a873cbdcef08ffb871b","user":{"login":"ibuenros","id":1364112,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQxMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1364112?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros","html_url":"https://github.com/ibuenros","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":33570608,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzU3MDYwOA==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"ibuenros/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ibuenros","id":1364112,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQxMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1364112?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros","html_url":"https://github.com/ibuenros","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ibuenros/gobblin","description":null,"fork":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin","forks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/forks","keys_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/keys{/key_id}","collaborators_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/collaborators{/collaborator}","teams_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/teams","hooks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/hooks","issue_events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/issues/events{/number}","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/events","assignees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/assignees{/user}","branches_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/branches{/branch}","tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/tags","blobs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/git/blobs{/sha}","git_tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/git/tags{/sha}","git_refs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/git/refs{/sha}","trees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/git/trees{/sha}","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/statuses/{sha}","languages_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/languages","stargazers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/stargazers","contributors_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/contributors","subscribers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/subscribers","subscription_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/subscription","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/commits{/sha}","git_commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/git/commits{/sha}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/comments{/number}","issue_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/issues/comments{/number}","contents_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/contents/{+path}","compare_url":"https:
