https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/46583 to branch-3.5\r\nOriginal JIRA: SPARK-48276\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nOriginal PR proposed these changes:\r\n- Add the missing `__repr__` method for `SQLExpression`\r\n- Also adjust the output of `lit(None): None -> NULL` to be more consistent with the Spark Classic\r\n\r\nI had to make very minor modifications to fix unclean cherry-pick:\r\n- The UT added in the original PR needed an import.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n- In Spark 3.5, when PySpark is launched with a remote `Spark Connect` configuration, calls to `pyspark.sql.functions.expr` incorrectly return `Column<None>` instead of the expected expression. This change addresses the issue to ensure proper expression resolution in Spark Connect mode.\r\n- As per original PR: [Bug fix] All expressions should implement the `__repr__` method.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, this PR ensures that `pyspark.sql.functions.expr` correctly resolves expressions in Spark Connect mode. Previously, it returned `Column<None>`, but now it behaves correctly.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManually tested. Also original PR added a UT.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n1. [CORE] Add cogroup and cogroupSorted variants for up to 6 additional KeyValueGroupedDatasets.\r\n2. [CONNECT] Add CoGroupMapV2 and deprecate CoGroupMap relation.\r\n    - Clients using CoGroupMap send a function of type `(K, Iterator[V1], Iterator[v2) => Iterator[R]` and we will need to continue supporting that. Clients using CoGroupMapV2 will be sending a function of type `(K, Seq[Iterator[Any]]) => Iterator[R]`.\r\n    - This will also support [SPARK-42349](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-42349) in a future PR.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  5. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently, you can only cogroup a KeyValueGroupedDataset with one other KeyValueGroupedDataset. If chaining calls to cogroup additional KeyValueGroupedDatasets, you end up causing additional shuffle and serialization steps that are inefficient.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as new features, bug fixes, or other behavior changes. Documentation-only updates are not considered user-facing changes.\r\n\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, new methods in KeyValueGroupedDataset api.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUnit tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write

If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nRight now, effectively set all fields in a schema to nullable, regardless of what the user specifies.\r\n- However, when Avro encoding is used, we want to enforce nullability in order to enable the schema evolution cases we support. \r\n- Nullability can only be set by the user in Python, so when non-nullable fields are defined, we throw an error\r\n- In Scala, Encoders.product set fields to non-nullable by default (user cannot configure this), so we turn the fields to nullable \r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n* schema property returns a deepcopy everytime to ensure completeness. However this creates a performance degradation for internal use in dataframe.py. we make the following changes:\r\n\r\n1. `columns` returns a copy of the array of names. This is the same as classic\r\n2. all uses of schema in dataframe.py now calls the cached schema, avoiding a deepcopy\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n* this does not scale well when these methods are called thousands of times like `columns` method in `pivot`\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  3. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as new features, bug fixes, or other behavior changes.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nConsidering there is support to stop spark context with required exit code, This PR aims to use the same to add it to java spark context as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently to use `stop(exitCode)` method for  JavaSparkContext, user has to call `javaSparkContextsparkContext.stop(exitCode)`.\r\nPost this PR user can directly do `javaSparkContextsparkContext.stop(exitCode)` to invoke same.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, it introduces an extra method in JavaSparkContext class\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis was tested in internal/production k8 cluster\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2025-01-31T05:24:08Z","updated_at":"2025-02-08T03:10:45Z","closed_at":"2025-02-08T03:10:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2babbbbf197ef1690a323166fdb9243f56ae466d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49746/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49746/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/49746/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2cce3c3aea6ed79c1ab5bc59fc5aa80702c3ebbb","head":{"label":"prathit06:SPARK-51048","ref":"SPARK-51048","sha":"2cce3c3aea6ed79c1ab5bc59fc5aa80702c3ebbb","user":{"login":"prathit06","id":53890994,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzODkwOTk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53890994?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/prathit06","html_url":"https://github.com/prathit06","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prathit06/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prathit06/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prathit06/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prathit06/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prathit06/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prathit06/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prathit06/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prathit06/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prathit06/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":855833464,"node_id":"R_kgDOMwL7eA","name":"spark","full_name":"prathit06/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"prathit06","id":53890994,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzODkwOTk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53890994?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/prathit06","html_url":"https://github.com/prathit06","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prathit06/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prathit06/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prathit06/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prathit06/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prathit06/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prathit06/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prathit06/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prathit06/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prathit06/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/prathit06/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWrite the month and days fields of intervals with one call to Platform.put/getLong() instead of two calls to Platform.put/getInt().\r\n\r\nIn commit ac07cea234f4fb687442aafa8b6d411695110a4e there was a performance improvement to reading a writing CalendarIntervals in UnsafeRow. This makes writing intervals consistent with UnsafeRow and has better performance compared to the original code.\r\n\r\nThis also fixes big endian platforms where the old (two calls to getput) and new methods of reading and writing CalendarIntervals do not order the bytes in the same way. Currently CalendarInterval related tests in Catalyst and SQL are failing on big endian platforms.\r\n\r\nThere is no effect on little endian platforms (byte order is not affected) except for performance improvement.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n* Improves performance reading and writing CalendarIntervals in Unsafe* classes\r\n* Fixes big endian platforms where CalendarIntervals are not read or written correctly in Unsafe* classes\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as new features, bug fixes, or other behavior changes. Documentation-only updates are not considered user-facing changes.\r\n\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting unit tests on big and little endian platforms\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n<!--\r\nIf

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR proposes a change that enforces determinism when assigning implicit aliases to collation types.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWith the current implementation, `Alias` can be computed both before and after type coercion rule. This will cause non-deterministic behavior when assigning implicit aliases to objects that are (or will be) type coerced to collation type. \r\n\r\nGiven a query like:\r\n ```select concat_ws(' ' collate utf8_lcase, utf8_binary, 'SQL' collate utf8_lcase) from t5```\r\nwill produce output schema:\r\n```concat_ws(collate( , utf8_lcase), utf8_binary, collate(SQL, utf8_lcase))```\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, query like:\r\n```select 'a' collate unicode < 'A'```\r\nwill produce output schema:\r\n```(collate(a, unicode) < 'A' collate UNICODE)```\r\n\r\nThis PR will remove `collate` from alias, making it deterministic in all cases.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. Output schema will be changed in certain cases, as mentioned above.\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as new features, bug fixes, or other behavior changes. Documentation-only updates are not considered user-facing changes.\r\n\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nModified existing tests.\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer

However this creates a performance degradation for internal use in dataframe.py. we make the following changes:\r\n\r\n1. `columns` returns a copy of the array of names. This is the same as classic\r\n2. all uses of schema in dataframe.py now calls the cached schema, avoiding a deepcopy\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n* this does not scale well when these methods are called thousands of times like `columns` method in `pivot`\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

changes needed?\r\n\r\nApache Spark has been supposed to use `hive.llap.scope` for `hive-llap-common` dependency and `hive` module do it correctly.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/a1b0f256c04e5b632075358d1e2f946e64588da6/sql/hive/pom.xml#L119-L123\r\n\r\nSince Apache Spark 3.0.0 (SPARK-27176), the root `pom.xml` file has been using a wrong scope mistakenly. Probably, it's due to `-Phive-provided` support. This causes a confusion to other external systems and the users. We had better fix the root `pom.xml` to use `hive.llap.scope` correctly.\r\n- #23788\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, there is no change technically because `hive` module has been using a correct scope.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nTests only. This the same PR as [this](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/49628). The only difference is that this one is for `branch-4.0`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nMaking sure that having multiple parametrization nodes in the parsed logical plan is handled properly. Multiple parametrization nodes are made by doing a union of different dataframes over SparkConnect, and this feature was not supported previously, but [this](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/49442) PR managed to support it, so testing for this feature was needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as new features, bug fixes, or other behavior changes. Documentation-only updates are not considered user-facing changes.\r\n\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nTests in. `ClientE2ETestSuite`.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nReformat `Describe As JSON` statistics table metadata into a dict rather than string for improved parse-ability\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nExisting `Describe` formats table statistics into a string `xxx bytes, xxx rows` which is not conducive to parsing. This PR stores the table statistics metadata in raw format and delegates the formatting to the caller of toJsonLinkedHashmap, for improved parsing of the JSON statistics.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as new features, bug fixes, or other behavior changes. Documentation-only updates are not considered user-facing changes.\r\n\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, it affects the output of `Describe As JSON`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded to test suite `DescribeTableSuite`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for details.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2025-01-29T17:27:13Z","updated_at":"2025-02-04T04:39:20Z","closed_at":"2025-02-04T04:39:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f35571098b92851ea1c466ea571762b40a815bea","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49728/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49728/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/49728/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d9e81f4db482a8fb2d8cd1ac6414435d729799b8","head":{"label":"asl3:asl3/describetable-statistics","ref":"asl3/describetable-statistics","sha":"d9e81f4db482a8fb2d8cd1ac6414435d729799b8","user":{"login":"asl3","id":68875504,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODc1NTA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68875504?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asl3","html_url":"https://github.com/asl3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asl3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asl3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asl3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asl3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asl3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asl3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asl3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asl3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asl3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":645574658,"node_id":"R_kgDOJnqwAg","name":"spark","full_name":"asl3/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"asl3","id":68875504,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODc1NTA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68875504?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asl3","html_url":"https://github.com/asl3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asl3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asl3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asl3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asl3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asl3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asl3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asl3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asl3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asl3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/asl3/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to remove `hive-llap-common` compile dependency from Apache Spark.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTechnically, Apache Spark is not using this jar. We had better exclude it from Apache Spark distribution in order to mitigate security concerns.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, this is a removal of dependency which may affect existing Hive UDF jars.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?  \r\nThis PR introduces a new explain mode `off` to disable the generation of physical plan strings. It also modifies the internal attribute `cachedName` of `CachedRDDBuilder` objects.  \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?  \r\nWhenever a plan changes (which happens frequently when AQE kicks in), the physical plan's explain is generated as a plain string. This process is highly expensive for large plans. Moreover, these strings are stored in the `ListenerBus` of `SparkContext`, consuming heap memory and potentially leading to OutOfMemory errors.  \r\n\r\nDue to its potential negative impact on Spark applications, this information should be available only on demand for debugging purposes. This PR introduces a new explain mode `off`, which is set as the default to prevent unnecessary string generation. However, explicit explanations of a DataFrame remain accessible even when this mode is active.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, when a `CachedRDDBuilder` object is created without a defined `tableName`, the full string representation of the plan is also computed, only to later extract the first 1024 characters. This is an expensive operation and has been replaced with a more efficient call to `simpleStringWithNodeId` to avoid unnecessary computation.  \r\n\r\n**IMPORTANT NOTE:** This issue is causing an OutOfMemory (OOM) error in certain unit tests within GraphFrames, as reported in [Connected Components gives wrong results](https://github.com/graphframes/graphframes/issues/453). It may also be a contributing factor to the frequent overuse of checkpoints not only in GraphFrames, but also for many Spark users.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?  \r\nYes. By default, plan descriptions will no longer be available in the Spark UI. If users require this information, they must explicitly enable it by setting the `spark.sql.ui.explainMode` Spark configuration.  \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?  \r\nUnit tests from **sql/core** and **sql/catalyst**, along with the test attached to the [SPARK-50992](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-50992) ticket.  \r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?  \r\nNo.

...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis appears to be an issue caused by multi-threaded deletion of the `tempdir`.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/42898c62b4c197e88b842eaa840986cb70d93a9c/core/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/LocalRootDirsTest.scala#L42\r\n\r\n\r\nRefer to the code above, in `LocalRootDirsTest#beforeEach` method, `tempDir = Utils.createTempDir(namePrefix = \"local\")` invokes `ShutdownHookManager.registerShutdownDeleteDir` to register `tempDir` for deletion via a shutdown hook. Therefore, if `tempDir` remains unchanged during the test case, manual cleanup is unnecessary in `LocalRootDirsTest#afterEach` method.\r\n\r\nHowever, given that `tempDir` is defined as `protected var tempDir`, it is possible for it to be altered within the test case. Hence, additional checks are implemented before manually cleaning up `tempDir`:\r\n\r\n1. `tempDir` has not been registered for cleanup via a shutdown hook.\r\n2. `tempDir` is not a subpath of any path that has been registered for cleanup via a shutdown hook.\r\n\r\nThis approach helps to minimize the risk of a race condition where multiple threads attempt to clean up the `tempDir` concurrently. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Pass GitHub Actions\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to prevent `HiveClient.runSqlHive` invocation in non-testing environment.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`HiveClient.runSqlHive` is a kind of testing utility which Apache Spark uses during unit testing in order to compare with Hive result. We had better guarantee that this is not used in non-testing environments.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git grep runSqlHive | grep test | wc -l\r\n      84\r\n\r\n$ git grep runSqlHive | grep -v test\r\nsql/hive/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/hive/client/HiveClient.scala:  def runSqlHive(sql: String): Seq[String]\r\nsql/hive/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/hive/client/HiveClientImpl.scala:  override def runSqlHive(sql: String): Seq[String] = {\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo. This is a method of private class, `HiveClient`.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/3badfd2c41d33fe5f1cbd1d7345c749b7af81574/sql/hive/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/hive/client/HiveClient.scala#L42\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nIn testing environment, it always succeed. So, we need to check manually.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt package -Phive -Phive-thriftserver\r\n\r\n$ bin/spark-shell\r\nWARNING: Using incubator modules: jdk.incubator.vector\r\nUsing Spark's default log4j profile: org/apache/spark/log4j2-defaults.properties\r\nSetting default log level to \"WARN\".\r\nTo adjust logging level use sc.setLogLevel(newLevel).

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr removes a test file `StagePageSuite.scala` that is no longer needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe current `StagePageSuite.scala` contains one test case and one private method. The reasons for cleaning them up are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. The assertion in the test case \"ApiHelper.COLUMN_TO_INDEX should match headers of the task table\" was cleaned up in SPARK-44490 | https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/42085. Currently, this test case only creates a `StageData` object and an `AppStatusStore` object, with no other operations or assertions. Moreover, the creation of these objects is also covered in other test cases, such as `KVStoreProtobufSerializerSuite`, `AppStatusStoreSuite`, etc. Therefore, this is already an unnecessary test case and can be cleaned up.\r\n\r\n2. The private method `renderStagePage` has not been used since SPARK-21809 | https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/21688, so it can be cleaned up.\r\n\r\nAfter cleaning up the above content, `StagePageSuite.scala` becomes an empty file, so it can be completely deleted.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass GitHub Actions\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2025-01-29T02:23:35Z","updated_at":"2025-01-29T04:37:25Z","closed_at":"2025-01-29T04:36:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c80629e0f31c7014d0342073a42e636f3b3aaf86","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605079,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDc5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/WEB%20UI","name":"WEB

src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/86946e19-ffdd-42dd-974a-62a8300ddac8\" />\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently AQE framework is not fully self-contained since not all plan segments can be put into a query stage: the final \"stage\" basically executed as a nonAQE plan. This PR added a result query stage for AQE to unify the framework. With this change, we can build more query stage level features, one use case like https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/44013#issuecomment-2421167393\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR aims to remove unused `tableSampleClause` in `build()` method of `MsSqlServerSQLQueryBuilder` and `DB2SQLBuilder`.\r\n\r\nFrom the discussion here: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/49711#discussion_r1932335212\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently, `MsSqlServerDialect` and `DB2Dialect` don't support `tableSample` (default value of `supportsTableSample` is `false`), so `tableSampleClause` is unnecessary when building sql in the `build()` method.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as new features, bug fixes, or other behavior changes. Documentation-only updates are not considered user-facing changes.\r\n\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUpdated a  related test case and passed GA.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

is a port of 86efd59f665d23e2dc4215d0047df43deff700a9 to branch-4.0. It includes 98957380be9856de480dadd21e4239322e199295 which fixes an issue in Catalyst with reflection..\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR makes the shared SQL (JVM) interface the primary interface for Scala/JVM based Dataframe programming.\r\n\r\nThe implementations are moved to the `classic` and `connect` sub packages.\r\n\r\nThe connect client had to be moved to the sql/connect/common package because serialization requires the captured client classes to be on the classpath when deserialized on the server.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis is the final step in creating a unified Scala interface for both Classic and Connect.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.","created_at":"2025-01-28T14:20:17Z","updated_at":"2025-01-28T17:59:56Z","closed_at":"2025-01-28T17:57:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"986bd51ca3a74b242b55cae30dd7ade1229391c7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1405801475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/ML","name":"ML","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1405803268,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAzMjY4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/MLLIB","name":"MLLIB","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdded a new lazy boolean exprValHasIndeterministicCharacter in the Expression class, to indicate whether the expression's evaluation result was obtained using some indeterministic calculation.\r\nThe main difference between existing deterministic boolean and this is , that the former determines if same expression is evaluated more than once in a given iteration would its value change or not. Also on that basis, any leaf expression would always be deterministic.\r\nBut the latter  indicates if an expression's evaluation used/uses any non deterministic component.  So here even the leaf expression ( like Attribute) can have non deterministic character flag as true, if its pointing to some result obtained via indeterministic calculation.\r\n\r\nApart from that code of ShuffleDependency is augmented to indicate if the hashing expression is using any non deterministic component.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe changes are needed to ensure that in case of non deterministic join keys, the whole Shuffle stage is re-executed instead of just the failing task of the stage.  This is achieved by fixing the bug in the Rdd.outputDeterministicLevel which now takes into account the indeterministic nature of ShuffleDependency\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded some basic tests.  Will be adding more tests to validate the functional bug of incorrect results.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2025-01-28T05:20:05Z","updated_at":"2025-01-29T05:56:00Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9d3f2c444aee6719a75aa73df7ff55982db94533","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4138679613,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs72rz09","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PANDAS%20API%20ON%20SPARK","name":"PANDAS

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/49559 introduces `AlterColumnSpec`, which has the field `newPosition` that should have been accounted for when calling `resolved`. Because it is currently not accounted for, `AlterColumnSpec` reports `resolved` to be true even when `newPosition` is not resolved.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nWhile this is currently not a problem with Spark, this might affect extensions or become a surprise in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as new features, bug fixes, or other behavior changes. Documentation-only updates are not considered user-facing changes.\r\n\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nNew unit test\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR removes SparkStrategy from the Connect shims.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSparkStrategy in Connect shims is causing some headaches Scala reflection based tests in Catalyst (see https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/48818). This was the smallest change that fixes this particular issues. Another approach would have been to split the shims projects into a sql-shims and a core-shims project.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWe now log the value of `interruptThread` when a `TaskRunner`'s `kill` method is killed. This should help with debugging when potential zombie Spark tasks do not seem to be exiting.  \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nToday, it's tricky to debug why a task is not exiting (and thus, why executors might be getting lost) without knowing for sure if it was issued a Java interrupt. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nRan `org.apache.spark.executor.ExecutorSuite` and verified the log looked as expected.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2025-01-28T00:26:15Z","updated_at":"2025-02-03T04:22:34Z","closed_at":"2025-02-03T04:22:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d65f7a9d74e3508c9c9d75c35957fa59e3c0ab6e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49699/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49699/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/49699/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c3f704374e443f4a4eb4b5dcf0120c7afe3d4ea6","head":{"label":"neilramaswamy:spark-51011","ref":"spark-51011","sha":"c3f704374e443f4a4eb4b5dcf0120c7afe3d4ea6","user":{"login":"neilramaswamy","id":33679306,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNjc5MzA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33679306?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilramaswamy","html_url":"https://github.com/neilramaswamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilramaswamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilramaswamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilramaswamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilramaswamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilramaswamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilramaswamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilramaswamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilramaswamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilramaswamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":688675173,"node_id":"R_kgDOKQxZZQ","name":"nr-spark","full_name":"neilramaswamy/nr-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"neilramaswamy","id":33679306,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNjc5MzA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33679306?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilramaswamy","html_url":"https://github.com/neilramaswamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilramaswamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilramaswamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilramaswamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilramaswamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilramaswamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilramaswamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilramaswamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilramaswamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neilramaswamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/neilramaswamy/nr-spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to increase `spark.kubernetes.allocation.batch.size` to 10 from 5 in Apache Spark 4.0.0.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSince Apache Spark 2.3.0, Apache Spark uses `5` as the default value of executor allocation batch size for 8 years conservatively.\r\n- https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/19468\r\n\r\nGiven that the improvement of K8s hardware infrastructure for last 8 year, we had better use a bigger value, `10`, from Apache Spark 4.0.0 in 2025.\r\n\r\nTechnically, when we request 1200 executor pod,\r\n- Batch Size `5` takes 4 minutes.\r\n- Batch Size `10` takes 2 minutes.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, the users will see faster Spark job resource allocation. The migration guide is updated correspondingly.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2025-01-26T23:11:21Z","updated_at":"2025-01-27T00:48:06Z","closed_at":"2025-01-27T00:47:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"46743648136d98efcf17c1384460e4e154c7beb9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605057,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/KUBERNETES","name":"KUBERNETES","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49681/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49681/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/49681/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7406264468ccb8dd6e3600637580493d5a1e07f6","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-50996","ref":"SPARK-50996","sha":"7406264468ccb8dd6e3600637580493d5a1e07f6","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":677218341,"node_id":"R_kgDOKF2IJQ","name":"spark","full_name":"dongjoon-hyun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun/spark","description":"Apache

This leads to:\r\n1. No tracking is available on Spark UI for stages which are necessary to build the `RDD`.\r\n2. Spark properties which are local to thread may not be set in the `RDD` execution context. This leads to these properties not being sent with `TaskContext` but some operations like reading parquet files depend on these properties (eg, case-sesitivity).\r\n\r\nTest scenario:\r\n```java\r\ntest(\"SPARK-50994: RDD conversion is performed with execution context\") {\r\n    withSQLConf(SQLConf.CASE_SENSITIVE.key -> \"true\") {\r\n      withSQLConf(SQLConf.PARQUET_VECTORIZED_READER_ENABLED.key -> \"false\") {\r\n        withTempDir(dir => {\r\n          val dummyDF = Seq((1, 1.0), (2, 2.0), (3, 3.0), (1, 1.0)).toDF(\"a\", \"A\")\r\n          dummyDF.write.format(\"parquet\").mode(\"overwrite\").save(dir.getCanonicalPath)\r\n\r\n          val df = spark.read.parquet(dir.getCanonicalPath)\r\n          val encoder = ExpressionEncoder(df.schema)\r\n          val deduplicated = df.dropDuplicates(Array(\"a\"))\r\n          val df2 = deduplicated.flatMap(row => Seq(row))(encoder).rdd\r\n\r\n          val output = spark.createDataFrame(df2, df.schema)\r\n          checkAnswer(output, Seq(Row(1, 1.0), Row(2, 2.0), Row(3, 3.0)))\r\n        })\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nIn the above scenario,\r\n- Call to `.rdd` triggers execution which performs shuffle after reading parquet\r\n- However, while reading parquet file `spark.sql.caseSensitive` is not set (even though it is passed during session creation) which is referred into `SQLConf` by `parquet-mr` reader\r\n- This leads to unexpected and wrong result of `dropDuplicates` as it would drop duplicates by either `a` or 'A'. Expectation is to drop duplicates by column `a`\r\n- This behaviour is not applicable to vectorized parquet reader because it reads case-sensitivity flag from `hadoopContext` hence is

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a back-port of #48627.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds code to `RewritePredicateSubquery#apply` to explicitly handle the case where an `Aggregate` node contains an aggregate expression in the left-hand operand of an IN-subquery expression. The explicit handler moves the IN-subquery expressions out of the `Aggregate` and into a parent `Project` node. The `Aggregate` will continue to perform the aggregations that were used as an operand to the IN-subquery expression, but will not include the IN-subquery expression itself. After pulling up IN-subquery expressions into a Project node, `RewritePredicateSubquery#apply` is called again to handle the `Project` as a `UnaryNode`. The `Join` will now be inserted between the `Project` and the `Aggregate` node, and the join condition will use an attribute rather than an aggregate expression, e.g.:\r\n```\r\nProject [col1#32, exists#42 AS (sum(col2) IN (listquery()))https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/40]\r\n+- Join ExistenceJoin(exists#42), (sum(col2)#41L = c2#39L)\r\n   :- Aggregate [col1#32], [col1#32, sum(col2#33) AS sum(col2)#41L]\r\n   :  +- LocalRelation [col1#32, col2#33]\r\n   +- LocalRelation [c2#39L]\r\n```\r\n`sum(col2)#41L` in the above join condition, despite how it looks, is the name of the attribute, not an aggregate expression.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe following query fails:\r\n```\r\ncreate or replace temp view v1(c1, c2) as values (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 7), (3, 1);\r\ncreate or replace temp view v2(col1, col2) as values (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 7), (3, 1);\r\n\r\nselect col1, sum(col2) in (select c2 from v1)\r\nfrom v2 group by col1;\r\n```\r\nIt fails with this error:\r\n```\r\n[INTERNAL_ERROR] Cannot generate code for expression: sum(input[1, int, false]) SQLSTATE: XX000\r\n```\r\nWith SPARK_TESTING=1, it fails with this error:\r\n```\r\n[PLAN_VALIDATION_FAILED_RULE_IN_BATCH] Rule org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.optimizer.RewritePredicateSubquery in batch RewriteSubquery generated an invalid plan: Special expressions are placed in the wrong plan:\r\nAggregate [col1#11], [col1#11, first(exists#20, false) AS (sum(col2) IN (listquery()))https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/19]\r\n+- Join ExistenceJoin(exists#20), (sum(col2#12) = c2#18L)\r\n   :- LocalRelation [col1#11, col2#12]\r\n   +- LocalRelation [c2#18L]\r\n```\r\nThe issue is that `RewritePredicateSubquery` builds a `Join` operator where the join condition contains an aggregate expression.\r\n\r\nThe bug is in the handler for `UnaryNode` in `RewritePredicateSubquery#apply`, which adds a `Join` below the `Aggregate` and assumes that the left-hand operand of IN-subquery can be used in the join condition. This works fine for most cases, but not when the left-hand operand is an aggregate expression.\r\n\r\nThis PR moves the offending IN-subqueries to a `Project` node, with the aggregates replaced by attributes referring to the aggregate expressions. The resulting join condition now uses those attributes rather than the actual aggregate expressions.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, other than allowing this type of query to succeed.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2025-01-25T01:52:55Z","updated_at":"2025-01-25T05:21:17Z","closed_at":"2025-01-25T05:21:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f26c2bfc3d85fbbca9b9bd00ed2f3d2f277f04ee","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49663/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/49663/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/49663/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/42ceb8003a2c312e8e80f01960cc983ad40c7fae","head":{"label":"bersprockets:aggregate_in_set_issue_br35","ref":"aggregate_in_set_issue_br35","sha":"42ceb8003a2c312e8e80f01960cc983ad40c7fae","user":{"login":"bersprockets","id":21131848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTMxODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21131848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets","html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":115567071,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTU1NjcwNzE=","name":"spark","full_name":"bersprockets/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bersprockets","id":21131848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTMxODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21131848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets","html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets/spark","description":"Mirror

Removing the assert and throwing a classified error for better error presentation\r\n2. In Kafka config updater, when we setAuthenticationConfigIfNeeded, we don't handle the case where user didn't specify the bootsrap server, hence leading to NoSuchElementException. Now throwing a properly classified error.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n- Add a generic zipPartitions method to take an arbitrary number of RDDs (for cases when >4 RDDs are to be zipped).\r\n- Update the JavaRDD api to include the same set of zipPartition functions as RDD.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nRDD.zipPartitions currently only allows up to 3 other RDDs to be zipped. This forces users to zipPartitions multiple times to zip more than 4 RDDs.\r\n\r\nAlso, the Java API only allows zipPartitions with 1 other RDD, so this brings parity between the two.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as new features, bug fixes, or other behavior changes. Documentation-only updates are not considered user-facing changes.\r\n\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, new zipPartitions functions in RDD and JavaRDD.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nAdded unit tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for
