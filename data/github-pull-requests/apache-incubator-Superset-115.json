-->\r\n\r\nCurrently the import functionality of Superset is split between the `ImportExportMixin` and the `import_obj` method in some of the models.\r\n\r\nThis PR finalizes the process of getting rid of the `import_obj` method, started in https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/11529, consolidating all the import functionality in a single place to make it easier to preserve backwards compatibility once we implement https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/issues/11167.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nFor the new export functionality (https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/issues/11167) I implemented a new function called `sanitize` that takes a model ID and generates a directory name by removing spaces and other special characters. Later, I discovered that werkzeug already offers a function called [secure_filename](https://tedboy.github.io/flask/generated/werkzeug.secure_filename.html) that is better.\r\n\r\nThis PR replaces `sanitize` with `secure_filename`.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nCurrently the import functionality in Superset is implemented in two different places:\r\n\r\n1. An `ImportExportMixin`, used by the CLI when importing datasources.\r\n2. Custom defined `import_obj` methods, used when importing dashboards (and associated objects) via CLI or web UI.\r\n\r\nMoving forward, to implement the import side of https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/issues/11167 I'd like to:\r\n\r\n1. Remove the custom `import_obj` methods, and use only the mixin.\r\n2. Consolidate the current import logic in commands, so that we can keep importing the current format in the future.\r\n\r\nThis PR consolidates the import logic for **dashboards** in a new command in the `superset.dashboards.commands.importers.v0` module. In the future I'll add a v1 version of the command for the format described in https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/issues/11167, and logic to route between different versions depending on the uploaded file.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes

SUMMARY\r\nThere is usability issue with top area for placing new objects in a dashboard. When crossing area with dragged object really fast, there is no indication of place where it can be dropped. There is no possibility to detect it better, but the height of area where it should detect and indicate place is now twice which should help in usability of drag and drop.\r\n\r\nMargins after placing windows remains the same as before.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nHere is showed area of detecting new object with the different background color.

Superset has `SecurityManager` to check whether a user has access to certain datasource, but all query results are still stored in the same cache, regardless of users' access levels. If a malicious party obtained access to the cache server via certain Superset user in a high-risk region, they get access to all cached data.\r\n\r\nBy separating cache storage for Superset metadata and the actual data users consume, we can have a better insulation of sensitive data by configuring different cache backend for high-risk regions while keeping the cache for all the Superset metadata in sync.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\nCI\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT:

SUMMARY\r\nAdds support for running chart queries in async workers, as proposed by [SIP-39](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/issues/9190), under a new `GLOBAL_ASYNC_QUERIES` feature flag.\r\n- Formalizes async event publishing using Redis Streams, with this implementation using a new `/api/v1/async_event/` endpoint for polling.\r\n- Adds async event middleware to `superset-frontend` to poll for events when the feature flag is enabled and there are chart components in a `loading` state.\r\n- Adds a new JWT token cookie (name configurable) to the client for validating async requests.\r\n- This PR affects charts using both the new `/api/v1/chart/data` API and the legacy `/superset/explore_json` endpoint in both dashboards and Explore (behind `GLOBAL_ASYNC_QUERIES` feature flag).\r\n- Abstracts and moves `set_and_log_cache` out of `viz.py`.\r\n\r\nRemaining issues:\r\n- Multi-line chart not rendering correctly ([component](https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui/blob/master/plugins/legacy-preset-chart-nvd3/src/LineMulti/LineMulti.jsx) will need updating as it does its own data fetching)\r\n\r\nTODO in separate follow-up PRs:\r\n- Query cancellation for async queries (see limitations in SIP-39)\r\n- Support async operation for CSV, raw results and sample data\r\n- Add support for [websocket event handling](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/11498) on the frontend\r\n- Update SQL Lab async query execution to use new async architecture (backwards compatible)\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\n- Enable the `GLOBAL_ASYNC_QUERIES` feature flag in your test environment and ensure correct chart rendering in both dashboards and Explore\r\n- Ensure synchronous chart rendering with the feature flag disabled functions correctly.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [x] Has associated issue: https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/issues/9190\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Requires DB Migration.\r\n- [ ] Confirm DB Migration upgrade and downgrade tested.\r\n- [x] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or

SUMMARY\r\nNode.js WebSocket server application for [SIP-39](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/issues/9190) pub/sub architecture. This PR contains:\r\n\r\n- The main WebSocket application (`superset-websocket/src/index.ts`)\r\n  - Consumes Redis streams for event data, pushing to connected WebSocket clients\r\n  - Utilizes signed JWT for authentication from Superset frontend\r\n  - Leverages WebSocket `ping`/`pong` for connection management\r\n  - Configurable connection timeout and garbage collection settings\r\n- A new Superset Flask app config key: `GLOBAL_ASYNC_QUERIES_WEBSOCKET_URL`\r\n- An Express-based client application for testing and development only (`superset-websocket/utils/client-ws-app/`)\r\n- CI actions for running automated unit tests\r\n\r\nCorresponding Superset web app changes are in the following PRs: https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/11499, https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/13696\r\n\r\n**To be added in future PRs:**\r\n- Integration tests\r\n- Containerization\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n1. CI runs unit tests and build checks\r\n2. Run the WS server locally and configure Superset to use the websocket transport for async queries\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT:

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nNow that `ENABLE_REACT_CRUD_VIEWS` is behind a feature flag (https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/11371) there seems to be merit in deprecating the config parameter with the same name (DRY) and using the feature flag framework to check the status, otherwise you'll likely need to override this in two places.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!---

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nGlobally disable underscore for links in menu items. Adding style overrides with styled components.\r\n\r\nDevelopers should now use `import { MenuItem } from \"src/common/components\"`, instead of `Menu.Item`.\r\n\r\nAlso makes antd exports explicit so

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe `/recent_actively` API now almost always returns empty arrays. We don't know how long has it been broken but it seems the intention was to show dashboards and charts users recently viewed.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this API endpoint by using the correct logging actions for the Explore and Dashboard page.\r\n\r\nThis endpoint is used on the `/superset/welcome` page and user profile page. Since PR #11206 will make the recently viewed info more prominent, it is important to get this fixed.\r\n\r\nI also added a \"distinct\" mode (which is the default and can be turned off by setting `distinct=false`) that will return only distinct subjects with their latest viewed date.\r\n\r\nCurrently I'm just throwing stuff in the `views/core.py` file, it might worth creating a `superset.users` module and migrating this to a better-tested and better-documented new API endpoint in the future.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n####

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nWith the right timing, it's possible to cancel a query, see the message and toast saying \"Query was stopped\", but still have results being loaded in SQL Lab shortly after. I added a check to prevent this from happening.\r\n\r\nNote that `actions.QUERY_FAILED` has a [similar check](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/11449/files#diff-b8119ae678e250a0ce86a81c6ce6a84125a3c3fdf9bbc103586cf16043573011R344-R347).\r\n\r\nI also noticed that this has been fixed in the past (https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/2164), but removed later (https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/4833). @graceguo-supercat and @john-bodley do you have context why it was removed? It doesn't seem obvious to me from the PR.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\n\r\nThe problem is hard to repro because of the sensitive timing, but I was able to make it happen twice by changing the examples database to async and canceling running queries at the right time.\r\n\r\nAfter the fix was applied I wasn't able to repro the problem.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Requires DB Migration.\r\n- [ ] Confirm DB Migration upgrade and

SUMMARY\r\n\r\n`src/explore/components/controls/withVerification` was introduced #7468 for a very specific use case here at Airbnb. It was not used anywhere within the official Superset. Since then, there were [some](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/10264) [efforts](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/10224) on improving the chart controls that have failed to consider this `withVerification` HOC:\r\n\r\n1. Controls will now only re-render when their own values are updated. Previous a re-render may be triggered even if only other control values are changes.\r\n2. Control configs now accept a custom React component as control type, meaning developers don't have to pre-register a control in `src/explore/component/controls/index.js`.\r\n\r\nThis PR refactors the `withVerification` HOC to a functional component and renamed it to `withAsyncVerification`, with a couple of more enhancements and bugfixes:\r\n\r\n1. Instead of setting `getEndpoint` that specifies a Superset API endpoint, developers can set an async `verify` function that returns an arbitrary promise. This makes it possible to run verification via other type of async operations---such as calling a typed API function created with [makeApi](https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui/pull/666).\r\n2. It now accepts an `onChange` hook, which will be called every time users change control values. Developers have access to the full control props (as well as the the Redux actions by association) in the `onChange` callback, making it possible to trigger updates and revalidation on other controls.\r\n\r\nWe could have removed `withVerification` from the Superset codebase for good since control configs now accept custom React components, but I figured this pattern might be useful to the community, too, so decided to keep it.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\nUnit tests.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nthe github action we're using to lint PR titles has a feature that adds PR reviews (as comments).

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nSort by database is currently broken for the saved query list view, due to the api call being made with `database` instead of `database.database_name`. This PR fixes the columns config so the correct api call is issued. \r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\nmanually tested: saved query can sort and filter by database. \r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!---

SUMMARY\r\n`TableColumn` has three properties to check the datatype of a column: `is_numeric`, `is_string` and `is_temporal`. `is_temporal` is usually referenced when a new dataset is added to populate default values for `is_dttm`, which indicates whether or not a column is to added to the time column dropdown. While we should usually directly reference `is_dttm`, the other slightly ambiguously named property can sometimes be used, causing incorrect behaviour.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the behaviour of `is_temporal` to first check the value of `is_dttm`, and if that `is not None` (=after initial metadata extraction), return that value, otherwise check the datatype based on the column type. The placeholder text is also fixed, as it featured non-compliant syntax (Year is `%Y`, not `%y`).\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable

SUMMARY\r\nFixes issues https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/issues/11388 and https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/issues/11404.\r\nChanges in `AdhocFilterOption` might be in conflict with https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/11412 by @mistercrunch - unfortunately it seems that mutating a `adhocFilter.isNew` prop is necessary until we do a deeper refactor. Simply making that prop a part of the state leads to various issues regarding auto-opening the popup when new filter is added - particularly when there are multiple unsaved filters.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nAs shown on the gif, the popup opens automatically and typing spaces and comas works properly.\r\n![ezgif com-gif-maker

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nI fixed tests in query.test.ts file.   it('successfully saves a query', () => { required deep changes - only way I saw to open saved sql query was in new tab - cypress does not support this easily (ok supports but trick with href does not work in this case) so I visit url created in test and then verify final assertions.\r\nI removed wait on requests - > with only one request it was unstable on my computer - one request was faster than cypress and it was waiting for already finished request.\r\nI disabled second test to make this PR possible to merge - bigger problem in this second one. I work on this and I will submit another PR for this.\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should
