PR adds support for bulk retrieval with the SERVICE clause (related issue #1314 ).\r\n\r\nIts currently a draft but it might a good enough for a discussion.\r\n\r\n* It introduces a base class QueryIterRepeatApplyBulk of which QueryIterRepeatApply is a specialization. The only difference is that the `nextStage` function receives the input QueryIterator rather than only an individual binding.\r\n* QueryIterServiceBulk is the new implementation that should eventually supersede QueryIterService.\r\n* The implementation retrieves a batch of bindings from the input interator w.r.t. to the constants `ARQ.serviceBulkRequestMaxItemCount` and `ARQ.serviceBulkRequestMaxByteSize`.\r\n* Consecutive bindings that refer to the same service IRI (after substitution)  are subject to form a bulk request. Conversely, the implementation is not yet so smart to group non-consecutive service references as it makes resources management more complex.\r\n* If a batch of bindings has size 1 then the implementation performs the usual binding substitution.\r\n* Queries created from batches with more than 1 item have a VALUES block injected. This block uses only the join variables and a special `idx` variable. Values of this variable reference the index of the parent binding in the batch. This way, a remote binding's parent (=input) binding can be identified using `idx`. The generated Query sorts by `idx` which allows for streaming because the remote bindings arrive in the same order as the parent bindings in the batch.\r\n* There is a \"partition\" machinery in place that deconstructs a batch response in a manner such that for every parent binding the corresponding stream of remote bindings can be obtained. I.e. it provides a view as if each parent binding in the batch was executed individually with the conventional approach. This e.g. allows for caching the results of the service clause execution for on the level of every parent binding. This is a bit of work in progress because I have a use case of connecting a caching system to it and I am looking into designing the API around it.\r\n\r\n## Rewrite Strategies\r\nThe rewriting strategy depends on the content of the SERVICE clause:\r\n\r\nThe following is an example load a model with people from DBpedia.\r\n```java\r\nModel model;\r\ntry (QueryExecution qe = QueryExecutionHTTP.newBuilder()\r\n    .endpoint(\"https://dbpedia.org/sparql\")\r\n    .query(\"CONSTRUCT WHERE { ?s a <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Person> } LIMIT 100\")\r\n    .build()) {\r\n    model = qe.execConstruct();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nA rewrite strategy to inject the bulk of bindings is chosen based on the content of the SERVICE clause:\r\n\r\n### Rewrite for Absent Slice\r\nIf there is no slice in the SERVICE clause's query, then a query is created that essentially has a join between a values block on the left hand size and the content of the service clause on the right hand side.\r\nIf the service query uses group by then it becomes a sub-query.\r\nThe \"outer query\" has a sort condtion on `idx` added (probably it could be omitted on most triple stores because results should be in the right order), and any further sort conditions are appended.\r\n\r\n```java\r\ntry (QueryExecution qe = QueryExecutionFactory.create(\r\n    \"SELECT * { ?s a <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Person> SERVICE <https://dbpedia.org/sparql> { { SELECT ?s ?p { ?s ?p ?o } ORDER BY ?p } } }\", model)) {\r\n    qe.getContext().set(ARQ.serviceBulkRequestMaxItemCount, 15);\r\n    qe.getContext().set(ARQ.serviceBulkRequestMaxByteSize, 1500);\r\n    ResultSetMgr.write(System.out, qe.execSelect(), ResultSetLang.RS_JSON);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe query sent to the remote endpoint has the form:\r\n```sparql\r\nSELECT  ?__idx__ ?p\r\nWHERE\r\n  { VALUES ( ?__idx__ ?s ) {\r\n      ( 0 <http://dbpedia.org/resource/1999_NHK_Trophy> )\r\n      ( 1 <http://dbpedia.org/resource/1909_World_Figure_Skating_Championships> )\r\n      ( 2 <http://dbpedia.org/resource/1914_World_Figure_Skating_Championships> )\r\n      ( 3 <http://dbpedia.org/resource/1999_Women's_Five_Nations_Championship> )\r\n    }\r\n    ?s  ?p  ?o\r\n  }\r\nORDER BY ASC(?__idx__) ?p\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Rewrite for Present Slice\r\nIn this case, for every parent binding a union member is created based on conventional substitution. If the batch has size 1 then the `idx` var is omitted (and no union is created).\r\n\r\n```java\r\ntry (QueryExecution qe = QueryExecutionFactory.create(String.join(\"\\n\",\r\n    \"SELECT * {\",\r\n    \"  ?s a <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Person> \",\r\n    \"  SERVICE <https://dbpedia.org/sparql> { { SELECT * { ?s ?p ?o } LIMIT 3 OFFSET 5 } }\",\r\n    \"}\"), model)) {\r\n    ResultSetMgr.write(System.out, qe.execSelect(), ResultSetLang.RS_JSON);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n```sparql\r\nSELECT  *\r\nWHERE\r\n  {   { { SELECT  *\r\n          WHERE\r\n            { <http://dbpedia.org/resource/1999_NHK_Trophy>\r\n                        ?p  ?o\r\n            }\r\n          OFFSET  5\r\n          LIMIT   3\r\n        }\r\n        BIND(0 AS ?__idx__)\r\n      }\r\n    UNION\r\n      {   { { SELECT  *\r\n              WHERE\r\n                { <http://dbpedia.org/resource/1909_World_Figure_Skating_Championships>\r\n                            ?p  ?o\r\n                }\r\n              OFFSET  5\r\n              LIMIT   3\r\n            }\r\n            BIND(1 AS ?__idx__)\r\n          }\r\n     # ...\r\n}}}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Interaction with ServiceExecutor API\r\nThe essential method of the API has this method:\r\n```java\r\nServiceExecution createExecutor(OpService opExecute, OpService original, Binding binding, ExecutionContext execCxt);\r\n```\r\nCurrently I simply pass in the bulk query as `opExecute` and set `binding` to a dummy one (empty).

What\r\nProcess request/service context in `AccessControlledDataset` the same way as is done in (parent) query processor, i.e. honour the server => dataset => endpoint context value priority order.\r\n\r\n### Why\r\nStandard SPARQL queries honour the context of the endpoint ([see docs](https://jena.apache.org/documentation/fuseki2/fuseki-config-endpoint.html)) as well as setting of reuqest-specific timeout via the `timeout` URL parameter. These two features allow one to:\r\n- Override context values specified at server and/or dataset level (e.g. disable access to text indexing or change the default timeout for the endpoint)\r\n- Specify per-request timeouts\r\n\r\n(See bottom of summary of example. See also [mailing list thread](https://markmail.org/message/n7tcbi3ihfzlvbdv#query:+page:1+mid:2mvx45a2avki4tvc+state:results).)\r\n\r\n### How\r\n- Use `QueryExec` to create the `QueryExecution` instead of `QueryExecutionFactory` (the latter does not consider `HTTPActions`'s context)\r\n- Use same `timeout` parameter logic for pre-request timeouts as in base SPARQL query processor\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Note**: I am not convinced that the way I've updated `AccessControlledDataset` (and promoted a helper method from `SPARQLQueryProcessor.java` to public) is the right way to go. But I can confirm that the following use-case works:\r\n\r\n1. Define a dataset `DS1` with `jena:text` indexing enabled\r\n2. Define a dataset `DS2`, with `AccessControlledDataset` wrapping `DS1`. (The access actual rules are irrelevant here.)\r\n3. Define service `A` exposing a query endpoint for `DS1`, with extended context: `ja:context [ ja:cxtName \"http://jena.apache.org/text#index\" ; ja:cxtValue false ] ;`\r\n4. Define service `B` the same as `A`, but for `DS2`\r\n\r\nCurrent behaviour (pre-patch):\r\n- `jena:text` is exposed only with query endpoint of `B`. SPARQL queries against `A` do not match text-indexed properties.\r\n\r\nExpected behaviour (post patch):\r\n- Neither `A` nor `B` match text-indexed properties","created_at":"2022-05-03T10:37:08Z","updated_at":"2025-01-02T21:41:20Z","closed_at":"2025-01-02T21:41:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/pulls/1291/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/pulls/1291/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/1291/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/statuses/a1eb933951fb6e5347b49e1834df36ca86eb167c","head":{"label":"vtermanis:vt-add-ctx-to-fuseki-access","ref":"vt-add-ctx-to-fuseki-access","sha":"a1eb933951fb6e5347b49e1834df36ca86eb167c","user":{"login":"vtermanis","id":6112689,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxMTI2ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6112689?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtermanis","html_url":"https://github.com/vtermanis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtermanis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtermanis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtermanis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtermanis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtermanis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtermanis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtermanis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtermanis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtermanis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":433626165,"node_id":"R_kgDOGdicNQ","name":"jena","full_name":"vtermanis/jena","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vtermanis","id":6112689,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxMTI2ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6112689?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtermanis","html_url":"https://github.com/vtermanis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtermanis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtermanis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtermanis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtermanis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtermanis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtermanis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtermanis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtermanis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vtermanis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vtermanis/jena","description":"Apache

the <code>Throwables</code> methods <code>lazyStackTrace</code> and <code>lazyStackTraceIsLazy</code>. They are no longer useful on any current platform. (6ebd7d8648)</li>\n<li><code>collect</code>: Added a new method <code>ImmutableMap.Builder.buildKeepingLast()</code>, which keeps the last value for any given key rather than throwing an exception when a key appears more than once. (68500b2c09)</li>\n<li><code>collect</code>: As a side-effect of the <code>buildKeepingLast()</code> change, the idiom <code>ImmutableList.copyOf(Maps.transformValues(map, function))</code> may produce different results if <code>function</code> has side-effects. (This is not recommended.) (68500b2c09)</li>\n<li><code>hash</code>: Added <code>Hashing.fingerprint2011()</code>. (13f703c25f)</li>\n<li><code>io</code>: Changed <code>ByteStreams.nullOutputStream()</code> to follow the contract of <code>OutputStream.write</code> by throwing an exception if the range of bytes is out of bounds. (1cd85d01c9)</li>\n<li><code>net</code>: Added <code>@CheckReturnValue</code> to the package (with a few exceptions). (a0e2577de6)</li>\n<li><code>net</code>: Added <code>HttpHeaders</code> constant for <code>Access-Control-Allow-Private-Network</code>. (6dabbdf9c9)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Added accumulate/update methods for <code>AtomicDouble</code> and <code>AtomicDoubleArray</code>. (2d875d327a)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>APIs promoted from <code>@Beta</code></h4>\n<ul>\n<li><code>base</code>: <code>Throwables</code> methods <code>getCausalChain</code> and <code>getCauseAs</code> (dd462afa6b)</li>\n<li><code>collect</code>: <code>Streams</code> methods <code>mapWithIndex</code> and <code>findLast</code> (8079a29463)</li>\n<li><code>collect</code>: the remaining methods in <code>Comparators</code>: <code>min</code>, <code>max</code>, <code>lexicographical</code>, <code>emptiesFirst</code>, <code>emptiesLast</code>, <code>isInOrder</code>, <code>isInStrictOrder</code> (a3e411c3a4)</li>\n<li><code>escape</code>: various APIs (468c68a6ac)</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

update on 2022.06.09 -> implementation almost ready, JMH benchmark results\r\n## trading RAM for speed\r\nStarting from a variant with very low memory requirements, I decided to trade some memory for speed. For this reason, I developed two implementations: GraphMem2 uses less memory than GraphMem in most cases. GraphMem2Fast uses more memory in most cases, but not excessively for large BSBM graphs.\r\nHere is a table with my samle graphs and the additional memory consumption due to the indexing structures in the different graph implementations:\r\nsample graph  | triples | size of triples | +GraphMem | +GraphMem2 | +GraphMem2Fast |\r\n--- | ---:| ---:| ---:| ---:| ---:|\r\npizza.owl.rdf | 1980 | 0.447 MB | 0.165 MB | 0.123 MB  | 0.150 MB |\r\ncheeses-0.1.ttl | 7,744 | 0.805 MB | 0.165 MB | 0.123 MB  | 0.150 MB |\r\nxxx_CGMES_EQ.xml | 272,800 | 72.568 MB | 15.158 MB | 12.405 MB  | 16.982 MB |\r\nxxx_CGMES_SSH.xml | 79,507 | 20.944 MB | 4.276 MB | 3.582 MB | 5.094 MB |\r\nxxx_CGMES_TP.xml | 47,455 | 12.310 MB | 2.815 MB | 2.635 MB | 3.331 MB |\r\nRealGrid_EQ.xml | 947,208 | 246.434 MB | 62.942 MB | 67.260 MB | 92.285 MB |\r\nRealGrid_SSH.xml | 187,034 | 44.737 MB | 14.639 MB | 13.486 MB | 18.654 MB |\r\nRealGrid_TP.xml | 96,740| 23.768 MB | 6.137 MB | 5.888 MB | 7.468 MB |\r\nRealGrid_SV.xml | 184,455 | 44.05 MB | 17.248 MB | 15.037 MB | 17.930 MB |\r\nBSBM_2500.ttl | 596,746 | 99.914 MB | 63.507 MB | 32.056 MB | 43.480 MB |\r\nBSBM_50000.ttl.gz | 17,424,059 | 3,069.049 MB | 1,843.851 MB | 759.397 MB | 1,110.948 MB |\r\n\r\n## using Java Microbenchmark Harness (JMH)\r\nApart from knowing better, I started without jmh and did my benchmarks with unit tests only at first. That was fine, up to the point where I started reading the results with wishful thinking. As I don't have much practice with jmh, hopefully I have used it correctly and with reliable results:\r\n- Graph#add\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53625519/172818326-cfbc26ca-806a-492a-b76c-4a88554b76b2.png)\r\n- Graph#find(ANY, ANY, ANY) (details for other combinations are roughly comparable)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53625519/172818865-749634a1-86d3-40d0-bbea-5b9c4d375d35.png)\r\n- Graph#contains\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53625519/172818553-c93f4b09-4145-49cd-ad98-29da29334d24.png)\r\n- Graph#delete\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53625519/172818457-bdbd5418-5456-4274-afb9-18f4cb8ae66f.png)\r\n\r\nThese and more benchmarks including Graph#stream, a big BDBM graph and different permutations of Graph#find as JMH JSON results:\r\n - [TestGraphMem_20220609.zip](https://github.com/apache/jena/files/8869354/TestGraphMem_20220609.zip), which can easily be browsed via https://jmh.morethan.io/ \r\n\r\n## code is not yet merged to this PR\r\nThe main work is finished in my option. The code is not yet merged into this PR as it ist not yet well documented and the additional classes need additional tests first. (althoug the jena project fully compiles and all tests are green, when I replace GraphMem by GraphMem2)\r\n\r\nI would like to propose GraphMem2 as a replacement for GraphMem based on the benchmarks and the memory consumption. If i see it right, it outperforms GraphMem in all disciplines (except deletion) while generally having a slightly lower or comparable memory footprint.\r\n\r\nGraphMem2Fast is faster at Graph#add and Graph#delete (comparable to GraphMem) while it uses more memory, which could be a problem when it is used in existing solutions. On the other hand, GraphMem2Fast has the same hashCode semantic as GraphMem where GraphMem2 uses a slightly different semantic.

However, it is slower than GaphMemUsingHashMaps in most cases (except Graph#delete). It took me quite some time and work to be confident to be able to provide such a solution.

I will write tests for the additional classes, add documentation and describe them properly in the next weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Outdated old deskription:\r\nAdded GraphMemUsingHashMap to replace the now deprecated GraphMem implementation:\r\n- This implementation basically follows the same pattern as GraphMem:\r\n  - all triples are stored in three hash maps:\r\n    - one with subjects as key, one with predicates as key and one with objects as key\r\n- Main differences between GraphMemUsingHashMap and GraphMem:\r\n  - GraphMem uses its own hash map and triple bag implementations while GraphMemUsingHashMap uses the standard java HashMap<K,V> and ArrayList<T>.\r\n  - GraphMemUsingHashMap optimizes find operations by\r\n    - implementing every possible permutation to avoid unnecessary repeated condition checks (Node.isConcrete)\r\n    - careful order of conditions to fail as fast as possible\r\n  - GraphMemUsingHashMap has the Graph#stream operations implemented as real java streams considering the same optimizations as the find operations and not wrapping iterators to streams.\r\n  - GraphMemUsingHashMap optimizes memory usage by using Node.getIndexingValue().hashCode() as hash keys instead of the Node.getIndexingValue() object itself. This is totally fine, because values are lists.\r\n- Benchmarks show that:\r\n  - adding triples is much faster than on GraphMem\r\n  - for large graphs this implementation need less memory than GraphMem\r\n  - find and contains operations are a bit faster than GraphMem\r\n  - stream operations are faster than GraphMem ( and can be accelerated even more by appending .parallel() )\r\n\r\n- The ExtendedIterator<> returned by Graph#find calls supports .remove and .removeNext to make it fully compatible with the usages of GraphMem in the whole jena repository.\r\n\r\nFactory --> now creates GraphMemUsingHashMap where it created GraphMem before.\r\n\r\nTests added:\r\npackage org.apache.jena.mem.test: TestGraphMemUsingHashMap, TestGraphMemUsingHashMap2, TestGraphMemUsingHashMapPackage\r\npackage org.apache.jena.mem: GraphMemUsingHashMap_CS.java\r\n\r\nThe following members of GraphMemBase were moved to the deprecated GraphMem:\r\n- public final TripleStore store;\r\n- protected abstract TripleStore createTripleStore();\r\n- protected final boolean isSafeForEquality( Triple t )\r\n\r\nNow deprecated in package org.apache.jena.mem:\r\n- ArrayBunch\r\n- BunchMap\r\n- GraphMem\r\n- GraphTripleStore\r\n- GraphTripleStoreBase\r\n- GraphTripleStoreMem\r\n- HashCommon\r\n- HashedBunchMap\r\n- NodeToTriplesMap\r\n- NodeToTriplesMapBase\r\n- NodeToTriplesMapMem\r\n- ObjectIterator\r\n- SetBunch\r\n- StoreTripleIterator\r\n- TripleBunch\r\n- WrappedHashMap\r\n-> all usages in the project are replaced by the new GraphMemUsingHashMap only the old tests remain, which are also marked as deprecated:\r\npackage org.apache.jena.mem.test: TestArrayTripleBunch, TestGraphMem, TestGraphMem2, TestGraphMemPackage, TestGraphTripleStore, TestHashCommon, TestHashedBunchMap TestHashedTripleBunch, TestTripleBunch, TestWrappedSetTripleBunch\r\npackage org.apache.jena.mem: ArrayBunch_CS, BunchMapContractTest, GraphMem_CS, GraphTripleStore_CS, GraphTripleStoreMem_CS, HashedBunchMap_CS, HashedTripleBunch_CS, SetBunch_CS, TripleBunchContractTest, WrappedHashMap\r\n\r\nModelExpansion.java\r\n- fixed a bug: modifying the collection while iterating on it\r\n\r\nDirty fixes due to different order when returning triples from Graph#find:\r\n- AbstractResultSetTests.java\r\n- ModelCom.java\r\n\r\nBenchmarks & methology:\r\nThe benchmark tests have not been added to the PR but are available in my branch [GraphMemUsingHashMapSorted](https://github.com/arne-bdt/jena/tree/GraphMemUsingHashMapSorted).\r\norg.apache.jena.mem.TestGraphMemVariants:\r\n- mainly measures Graph#add, Graph#find and Graph#stream\r\n- find and steam are testet against all permutations of subject, predicate and object are measured\r\norg.apache.jena.mem.TestGraphMemVariants_contains:\r\n- focuses on Graph#contains only for existing and non-existing triples\r\n\r\nGeneral benchmark methology:\r\n- one or multiples graphs are loaded from disk into one or multiples lists (org.apache.jena.mem.GraphMemWithArrayListOnly)\r\n- for each graph implementation a graph is created and all triples from the list are added via Graph#add (depending on the setup this is done multiple times to simulate working with many small graphs)\r\n- for positive tests, random triples are selected from the initial list and stored in a seaparate list\r\n- for negative Graph#contains tests, a list with random triples is generated\r\n- Graph#find is testet for reach triple in the positive list. The resulting iterator is processed to count the matches.\r\n- for streams only stream.count is measured, which seems to use shortcuts if the undderlying collection is not filtered and provides Collection#size. So some measurements show no time where streaming all triples would have consumed more time.\r\n- org.apache.commons.lang3.time.StopWatch is used to measure execution times\r\n- memory is measured by running org.apache.jena.mem.TestGraphMemVariantsBase#runGcAndGetUsedMemoryInMB, which seems to work pretty well and stable.\r\n\r\nResults:\r\n[graph_benchmarks_20220502.xlsx](https://github.com/apache/jena/files/8609143/graph_benchmarks_20220502.xlsx)\r\n\r\nMy interpretation of the benchmark results:\r\n- Memory consumption of GraphMemUsingHashMap less. On with small graphs, the difference is negligible, on large graphs it is signiffcant.\r\n- Graph#add --> GraphMemUsingHashMap is always 2-4 times faster than GraphMem.  (except for pathologcal cases: see below)\r\n- Graph#find -->  GraphMemUsingHashMap is always 2-4 times faster than GraphMem. \r\n- Graph#contains --> having an equal number of positive and negative tests, the overall performance of GraphMemUsingHashMap is 2-3 times better than GraphMem (except for pathologcal cases: see below)\r\n- ATTENTION: For Graph#contains with only positive matches, GraphMem is always faster than GraphMemUsingHashMap. In some cases 3 times faster. \r\n\r\n- Graph#stream is not covered by this test setup due to possible shortcuts of Steam#count \r\n  - though, other experiments not covered here, show that Graph.steam().parallel()  works pretty well on GraphMemUsingHashMap and not very well on GraphMem.steam()\r\n\r\n\"pathological case where every triple has the same subject\"\r\nIn the [discussion](https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/1273#discussion_r858521057) below [rvesse](https://github.com/rvesse) mentioned cases where there are few subjects with each containting many predicates and objects.\r\nIn the sample graphs, there is one \"RealGrid_SV.xml\" with data matching this description. \r\nIn this case Graph#add and Gaph#contains are getting increasingly slow.\r\nSo I did some benchmarks that point out the problem:\r\n[graph_benchmarks_contains_20220504.xlsx](https://github.com/apache/jena/files/8618986/graph_benchmarks_contains_20220504.xlsx)\r\n\r\nI followed the tip to perform \"the contains() scan on the smallest list (or if any list is empty bypassing it entirely)\" - maybe it was too late in the night - but unfortunately, the overall perfomance was even worse.\r\nSo I tried a different approach by having sorted lists of triples in the node maps. After testing with different combinations of wich maps to sort by which criteria I ended with a new implementation GraphMemUsingHashMapSorted in a separate [branch](https://github.com/arne-bdt/jena/tree/GraphMemUsingHashMapSorted).\r\nGraphMemUsingHashMapSorted sorts all lists in the subject map by object (indexingValue.hashCode) when they reach 40 entries. New entries are then inserted at the correct position (using binary search) to keep the lists sorted.\r\nIn my test cases I could not find ways to take further advantage of the sorted lists in Graph#stream or Graph#find. It is only used in Graph#add and in Graph#contains in the case where subject, predicate and object are concrete. \r\nComparing GraphMemUsingHashMap and GraphMemUsingHashMapSorted the benchmarks show:\r\n- in most cases the performance of Graph#.add in GraphMemUsingHashMapSorted is almost equal to GraphMemUsingHashMap.\r\n          - in the pathological cases GraphMemUsingHashMapSorted is much faster than GraphMemUsingHashMap\r\n- in most cases Graph#.contains in GraphMemUsingHashMapSorted is a tiny bit slower than GraphMemUsingHashMap. (the smaller the graph the bigger the differnce)\r\n           - in the pathological cases GraphMemUsingHashMapSorted is much faster than GraphMemUsingHashMap\r\nIf anywone has ideas on how to  improve GraphMemUsingHashMapSorted or has ideas for different apporaches, please send them to me!\r\n","created_at":"2022-04-25T18:24:32Z","updated_at":"2023-03-02T21:22:07Z","closed_at":"2023-01-08T17:34:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"02607151fd545edb377d3abdbb80520ac49b49e0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/pulls/1273/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/pulls/1273/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/1273/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/statuses/e305c97b86662ec0ec16fc38b83237c1e3222108","head":{"label":"arne-bdt:main","ref":"main","sha":"e305c97b86662ec0ec16fc38b83237c1e3222108","user":{"login":"arne-bdt","id":53625519,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjI1NTE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53625519?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arne-bdt","html_url":"https://github.com/arne-bdt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arne-bdt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arne-bdt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arne-bdt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arne-bdt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arne-bdt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arne-bdt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arne-bdt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arne-bdt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arne-bdt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":484398532,"node_id":"R_kgDOHN9VxA","name":"jena","full_name":"arne-bdt/jena","private":false,"owner":{"login":"arne-bdt","id":53625519,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjI1NTE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53625519?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arne-bdt","html_url":"https://github.com/arne-bdt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arne-bdt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arne-bdt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arne-bdt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arne-bdt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arne-bdt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arne-bdt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arne-bdt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arne-bdt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arne-bdt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/arne-bdt/jena","description":"Apache

BuiltinRegistry)` does not pass the `BuiltinRegistry` argument to `Rule.rulesParserFromReader()`. This means that a user-specified builtin registry cannot be used with rules that are loaded using `rulesFromURL()`. This seems like a bug, so I can create a corresponding GitHub or JIRA issue, but wanted to first present this pull request. This is a simple one-line fix to pass `registry` into `rulesParserFromReader()`, along with some additional unit tests and a minor reorganization for some of the `.rules` files.\r\n\r\nIf you checkout just the `TestRuleLoader.java` unit test file from this PR, you can see that the `load_from_file_with_custom_builtins()` test fails. After adding the change to `Rule.java`, the test passes.","created_at":"2022-04-21T22:36:38Z","updated_at":"2022-04-28T15:14:53Z","closed_at":"2022-04-28T11:29:52Z","merged_at":"2022-04-28T11:29:52Z","merge_commit_sha":"f456247c4023aa5c317937141e2771682cd0fcba","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/pulls/1268/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/pulls/1268/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/1268/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/statuses/b6651e65674c1ac7480085499ae293c460f8f716","head":{"label":"loticlabs:bugfix/rule-parse-builtins","ref":"bugfix/rule-parse-builtins","sha":"b6651e65674c1ac7480085499ae293c460f8f716","user":{"login":"loticlabs","id":16004038,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjE2MDA0MDM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16004038?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/loticlabs","html_url":"https://github.com/loticlabs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loticlabs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loticlabs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loticlabs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loticlabs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loticlabs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loticlabs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loticlabs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loticlabs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loticlabs/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":484070752,"node_id":"R_kgDOHNpVYA","name":"jena","full_name":"loticlabs/jena","private":false,"owner":{"login":"loticlabs","id":16004038,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjE2MDA0MDM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16004038?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/loticlabs","html_url":"https://github.com/loticlabs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loticlabs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loticlabs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loticlabs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loticlabs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loticlabs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loticlabs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loticlabs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loticlabs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loticlabs/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/loticlabs/jena","description":"Apache

href=\"https://github.com/oracle/graaljs/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md\">js's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h1>GraalVM JavaScript (Graal.js) Changelog</h1>\n<p>This changelog summarizes major changes between GraalVM versions of the GraalVM JavaScript (ECMAScript) language runtime.\nThe main focus is on user-observable behavior of the engine.\nChangelog may include unreleased versions.\nSee <a href=\"https://www.graalvm.org/release-notes/version-roadmap/\">version roadmap</a> for release dates.</p>\n<h2>Version 22.1.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Updated Node.js to version 16.14.2.</li>\n<li>Graal.js now requires Java 11+ and no longer supports Java 8.</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-numberformat-v3\">Intl.NumberFormat v3</a> proposal.</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-array-grouping\">Array Grouping v3</a> proposal. It is available in ECMAScript staging mode (<code>--js.ecmascript-version=staging</code>).</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal\">Temporal</a> proposal. It is available behind the experimental option <code>--js.temporal</code>.</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-array-find-from-last\">Array Find from Last</a> proposal. It is available in ECMAScript staging mode (<code>--js.ecmascript-version=staging</code>).</li>\n<li>Optimized closures to only keep references on variables in the lexical environment that are needed by (one or more) closures. This optimization can be disabled with the experimental option <code>--js.scope-optimization=false</code>.</li>\n<li>Moved the internal string representation to the new TruffleString type.</li>\n<li>Added option <code>--js.string-lazy-substrings</code> (default: true) to allow toggling the copying behavior of string slices. When enabled, string slices internally create string views instead of copying the given string region, which increases performance but may also increase memory utilization.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Version 22.0.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>ECMAScript 2022 mode/features enabled by default.</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/intl-displaynames-v2\">Intl.DisplayNames v2</a> proposal.</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-locale-info\">Intl Locale Info</a> proposal. It is available in ECMAScript staging mode (<code>--js.ecmascript-version=staging</code>).</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-DateTimeFormat-formatRange\">Intl.DateTimeFormat.prototype.formatRange</a> proposal.</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-extend-timezonename\">Extend TimeZoneName Option</a> proposal. It is available in ECMAScript staging mode (<code>--js.ecmascript-version=staging</code>).</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-enumeration\">Intl Enumeration API</a> proposal. It is available in ECMAScript staging mode (<code>--js.ecmascript-version=staging</code>).</li>\n<li>Updated Node.js to version 14.18.1.</li>\n<li>Added option <code>js.esm-bare-specifier-relative-lookup</code> (default: false) to customize how bare specifiers for ES Modules are resolved. When disabled, bare specifiers are resolved with an absolute path lookup. When enabled, bare specifiers are resolved relative to the importing module's path.</li>\n<li>ICU4J library moved to <code>truffle</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Version 21.3.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://tc39.es/proposal-private-fields-in-in\">Private Fields in <code>in</code></a> proposal. It is available behind the experimental option <code>--js.private-fields-in</code>.</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/JS-BigInt-integration\">JavaScript BigInt to WebAssembly i64 integration</a> proposal. It can be disabled using the <code>--js.wasm-bigint=false</code> option.</li>\n<li>Updated Node.js to version 14.17.6.</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-error-cause\">Error Cause</a> proposal.

It is available in ECMAScript 2022 (<code>--js.ecmascript-version=2022</code>).</li>\n<li>Implemented <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-class-static-block\">class static initialization blocks</a> proposal. It is available in ECMAScript 2022 (<code>--js.ecmascript-version=2022</code>).</li>\n<li>Added experimental Polyglot <code>Context</code> option <code>--js.esm-eval-returns-exports</code>. When enabled, <code>eval()</code> of an ES module will return a Polyglot <code>Value</code> containing the ES module exported namespace object. The option is disabled by default.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Version 21.2.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Graal.js now prints a warning when runtime compilation is not supported. This warning can be disabled using the '--engine.WarnInterpreterOnly=false' option or the '-Dpolyglot.engine.WarnInterpreterOnly=false' system property.</li>\n<li>Added the <code>js.unhandled-rejections</code> option to track unhandled promise rejections in a polyglot <code>Context</code>. By default, the option is set to <code>none</code>, and unhandled promise rejections are not tracked.</li>\n<li>Implemented the <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-set-methods\">New Set Methods</a> proposal. It is available behind an experimental flag (<code>--js.new-set-methods</code>).</li>\n<li>Implemented experimental operator overloading support. Use the experimental option <code>--js.operator-overloading</code> to enable it and consult <a href=\"https://github.com/oracle/graaljs/blob/master/docs/user/OperatorOverloading.md\">the documentation</a>.</li>\n<li>Updated RegExp Match Indices proposal with opt-in using the <code>d</code> flag.

`RowSetReaderJSON.process` method has been modified to delegate to the new streaming approach.\r\nA cleaner approach would be to use a separate RowSetReaderFactory and is subject to change as this PR progresses.\r\n\r\nAll existing tests in ARQ are green but there may yet be some uncaught corner cases.\r\nIn particular, a test case where 'head' comes after the 'results' key needs yet to be provided.\r\n","created_at":"2022-03-08T18:31:31Z","updated_at":"2022-04-09T13:53:52Z","closed_at":"2022-04-09T13:52:32Z","merged_at":"2022-04-09T13:52:32Z","merge_commit_sha":"4bcdf8fcb628bd7a413ecfee0155a2e08719cdf0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/pulls/1218/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/pulls/1218/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/issues/1218/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/jena/statuses/4bcdf8fcb628bd7a413ecfee0155a2e08719cdf0","head":{"label":"Aklakan:JENA-2302","ref":"JENA-2302","sha":"4bcdf8fcb628bd7a413ecfee0155a2e08719cdf0","user":{"login":"Aklakan","id":839608,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzOTYwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/839608?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan","html_url":"https://github.com/Aklakan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":246914975,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNDY5MTQ5NzU=","name":"jena","full_name":"Aklakan/jena","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Aklakan","id":839608,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzOTYwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/839608?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan","html_url":"https://github.com/Aklakan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Aklakan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Aklakan/jena","description":"Mirror

PR puts the version numbers of into the \"resolutions\" section of package.json.
