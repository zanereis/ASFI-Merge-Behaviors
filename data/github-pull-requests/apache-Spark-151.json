Since every time we need to allocate 4M+16byte memory, so two regions are used with one region only occupies 16byte. Then there are about **50%** memory waste.\r\nIt can happenes under different combinations of G1HeapRegionSize (varies from 1M to 32M) and pageSizeBytes (varies from 1M to 64M).\r\n\r\n We can demo it using following piece of code.\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic static void bufferSizeTest(boolean optimize) {\r\n    long totalAllocatedSize = 0L;\r\n    int blockSize = 1024 * 1024 * 4; // 4m\r\n    if (optimize) {\r\n      blockSize -= 16;\r\n    }\r\n    List<long[]> buffers = new ArrayList<>();\r\n    while (true) {\r\n      long[] arr = new long[blockSize/8];\r\n      buffers.add(arr);\r\n      totalAllocatedSize += blockSize;\r\n      System.out.println(\"Total allocated size: \" + totalAllocatedSize);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nRun it using following jvm params\r\n```\r\njava -Xmx100m -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:G1HeapRegionSize=4m -XX:-UseGCOverheadLimit -verbose:gc -XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions -XX:+G1SummarizeConcMark -Xss4m -XX:+ExitOnOutOfMemoryError -XX:ParallelGCThreads=4 -XX:ConcGCThreads=4\r\n```\r\n\r\nwith optimized = false\r\n```\r\nTotal allocated size: 46137344\r\n[GC pause (G1 Humongous Allocation) (young) 44M->44M(100M), 0.0007091 secs]\r\n[GC pause (G1 Evacuation Pause) (young) (initial-mark)-- 48M->48M(100M), 0.0021528 secs]\r\n[GC concurrent-root-region-scan-start]\r\n[GC concurrent-root-region-scan-end, 0.0000021 secs]\r\n[GC concurrent-mark-start]\r\n[GC pause (G1 Evacuation Pause) (young) 48M->48M(100M), 0.0011289 secs]\r\n[Full GC (Allocation Failure)  48M->48M(100M), 0.0017284 secs]\r\n[Full GC (Allocation Failure)  48M->48M(100M), 0.0013437 secs]\r\nTerminating due to java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space\r\n```\r\n\r\nwith optimzied = true\r\n```\r\nTotal allocated size: 96468624\r\n[GC pause (G1 Humongous Allocation) (young)-- 92M->92M(100M), 0.0024416 secs]\r\n[Full GC (Allocation Failure)  92M->92M(100M), 0.0019883 secs]\r\n[GC pause (G1 Evacuation Pause) (young) (initial-mark) 96M->96M(100M), 0.0004282 secs]\r\n[GC concurrent-root-region-scan-start]\r\n[GC concurrent-root-region-scan-end, 0.0000040 secs]\r\n[GC concurrent-mark-start]\r\n[GC pause (G1 Evacuation Pause) (young) 96M->96M(100M), 0.0003269 secs]\r\n[Full GC (Allocation Failure)  96M->96M(100M), 0.0012409 secs]\r\n[Full GC (Allocation Failure)  96M->96M(100M), 0.0012607 secs]\r\nTerminating due to java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR try to optimize the pageSize to avoid memory waste.\r\n\r\nThis case exists not only in `MemoryManagement`, but also in other places such as `TorrentBroadcast.blockSize`.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8.

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes a bug in nested column pruning for Generate. The bug happens after we replace extractor's reference attribute with generator's input, then when we try to replace a top extractor (e.g. `GetStructField`), if the replaced child expression is array type, `extractFieldName` will fail by throwing `ClassCastException`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n In particular, when we transform the extractor and replace with generator's input, we cannot simply do a transform up because because if we replace the attribute, `extractFieldName` could cause `ClassCastException` error. We need to get the field name before replacing down the attribute/other extractor.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n1. Move `ALTER NAMESPACE ... SET PROPERTIES` parsing tests to `AlterNamespaceSetPropertiesParserSuite`.\r\n2. Put common `ALTER NAMESPACE ... SET PROPERTIES` tests into one trait `org.apache.spark.sql.execution.command.AlterNamespaceSetPropertiesSuiteBase`, and put datasource specific tests to the `v1.AlterNamespaceSetPropertiesSuite` and `v2.AlterNamespaceSetPropertiesSuite`.\r\n\r\nThe changes follow the approach of #30287.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n1. The unification will allow to run common `ALTER NAMESPACE ... SET PROPERTIES` tests for both DSv1/Hive DSv1 and DSv2\r\n2. We can detect missing features and differences between DSv1 and DSv2 implementations.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nExisting unit tests and new tests.","created_at":"2021-12-09T04:14:47Z","updated_at":"2021-12-16T17:25:42Z","closed_at":"2021-12-13T04:45:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d8431596fc6a18638b739fa3828ad33a8865a066","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34842/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34842/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34842/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/aaf0e5c22f9e159d19c484d07029a7b06745ee28","head":{"label":"imback82:alter_namespace_set_properties_tests","ref":"alter_namespace_set_properties_tests","sha":"aaf0e5c22f9e159d19c484d07029a7b06745ee28","user":{"login":"imback82","id":12103644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTAzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12103644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82","html_url":"https://github.com/imback82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":190453549,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTA0NTM1NDk=","name":"spark-4","full_name":"imback82/spark-4","private":false,"owner":{"login":"imback82","id":12103644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTAzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12103644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82","html_url":"https://github.com/imback82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/imback82/spark-4","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen analyzing a view, we should not unnecessarily mark nested fields as nullable. If the columns projected by the view define themselves as non-nullable, their nullability should be preserved.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nConsider a view as follows with all fields non-nullable (required)\r\n```\r\nspark.sql(\"\"\"\r\n    CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW v AS \r\n    SELECT id, named_struct('a', id) AS nested\r\n    FROM RANGE(10)\r\n\"\"\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen trying to read this view, it incorrectly marks nested column a as nullable\r\n```\r\nscala> spark.table(\"v2\").printSchema\r\nroot\r\n |-- id: long (nullable = false)\r\n |-- nested: struct (nullable = false)\r\n |    |-- a: long (nullable = true)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, we can see that the view schema has been correctly stored as non-nullable\r\n```\r\nscala> System.out.println(spark.sessionState.catalog.externalCatalog.getTable(\"default\", \"v2\"))\r\nCatalogTable(\r\nDatabase: default\r\nTable: v2\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\nSchema: root\r\n |-- id: long (nullable = false)\r\n |-- nested: struct (nullable = false)\r\n |    |-- a: long (nullable = false)\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is caused by [this line](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/fb40c0e19f84f2de9a3d69d809e9e4031f76ef90/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/analysis/Analyzer.scala#L3546) in Analyzer.scala. Going through the history of changes for this block of code, it seems like `asNullable` is a remnant of a time before we added [checks](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/fb40c0e19f84f2de9a3d69d809e9e4031f76ef90/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/analysis/Analyzer.scala#L3543) to ensure that the from and to types of the cast were compatible. As nullability is already checked, it should be safe to add a cast without converting the target datatype to nullable.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. View analysis will preserve nullability of nested fields instead of marking all nested fields as nullable.\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded unit test\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n","created_at":"2021-12-08T19:30:01Z","updated_at":"2021-12-13T04:52:33Z","closed_at":"2021-12-13T04:52:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"319d3770441101b28bbc4cd6137802e365dd4b2a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34839/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34839/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34839/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/16b44a39278e2f20bbfc0987d1cb7859263d7039","head":{"label":"shardulm94:view-nullability","ref":"view-nullability","sha":"16b44a39278e2f20bbfc0987d1cb7859263d7039","user":{"login":"shardulm94","id":6961317,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NjEzMTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6961317?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94","html_url":"https://github.com/shardulm94","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":304161240,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMDQxNjEyNDA=","name":"spark","full_name":"shardulm94/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"shardulm94","id":6961317,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NjEzMTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6961317?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94","html_url":"https://github.com/shardulm94","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/shardulm94/spark","description":"Apache

Instead they will remain ShortWritables. ShortWritables are not Serializable, so spark will fail with a serialization error.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nUsers will be able to use InputFormats that use ShortWritables, which was previously not possible.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nI have adde unit tests in org.apache.spark.api.python.PythonHadoopUtilSuite. Without the code change these tests fail. I have also manually tested this in the situation where this originally came up -- if an Elasticsearch mapping has a short field and you read the data out using es-hadoop's pyspark integration's newAPIHadoopRDD method then it was previously failing but succeeds now.","created_at":"2021-12-08T16:20:50Z","updated_at":"2021-12-14T04:32:35Z","closed_at":"2021-12-13T00:06:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4a61211e8fcd85b04b82e9619b402786385d2cd7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34838/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34838/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34838/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/63f3bfec9b7a48b4e2296a17c2b0b36ecb7537a7","head":{"label":"masseyke:feature/add-shortwritable-support-to-pyspark","ref":"feature/add-shortwritable-support-to-pyspark","sha":"63f3bfec9b7a48b4e2296a17c2b0b36ecb7537a7","user":{"login":"masseyke","id":453603,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzYwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/453603?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masseyke","html_url":"https://github.com/masseyke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masseyke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masseyke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masseyke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masseyke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masseyke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masseyke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masseyke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masseyke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masseyke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":436299459,"node_id":"R_kgDOGgFmww","name":"spark","full_name":"masseyke/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"masseyke","id":453603,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzYwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/453603?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masseyke","html_url":"https://github.com/masseyke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masseyke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masseyke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masseyke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masseyke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masseyke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masseyke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masseyke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masseyke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masseyke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/masseyke/spark","description":"Apache

Currently, only `PKCS` is supported.\r\n\r\nIn this way, when an user doesn't pass `mode`/`padding` to the functions, the functions apply AES encryption/decryption in the `ECB` mode with the `PKCS5Padding` padding.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. For now, `aes_encrypt()` and `aes_decrypt()` rely on the jvm's configuration regarding which cipher mode to support, this is problematic as it is not fixed across versions and systems. By using default constants for new arguments, we can guarantee the same behaviour across all supported platforms.\r\n2. We can consider new arguments as new point of extension in the current implementation of AES algorithm in Spark SQL. In the future in OSS or in a private Spark fork, devs can implement other modes (and paddings) like GCM. Other systems have already supported different AES modes, see:\r\n   1.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nReset `numFailures` whenever a task attempt succeeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn extreme situation, if  one task has failed 3 times(max failed threshold is 4 in default), and there is a retry task and speculative task both in running state, then one of these 2 task attempts succeed and to cancel another. But executor which task need to be cancelled lost(oom in our situcation), this task marked as failed, and TaskSetManager handle this failed task attempt, it has failed 4 times so abort this stage and cause job failed.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, the meaning of `spark.task.maxFailures` has changed, from total count to continuous count of one particular task \r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to add a built-in plugin for K8s executor rolling decommission via the following.\r\n\r\n```\r\nspark-3.3.0-SNAPSHOT-bin-3.3.1/bin/spark-submit \\\r\n--master k8s://https://kubernetes.docker.internal:6443 \\\r\n--deploy-mode cluster \\\r\n-c

user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo. This is a new feature.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the K8s IT test.\r\n\r\nI verified that newly added test case `Rolling decommissioning (1 minute, 11 seconds)` passed.\r\n```\r\n[info] KubernetesSuite:\r\n[info] - Run SparkPi with no resources (16 seconds, 49 milliseconds)\r\n[info] - Run SparkPi with no resources & statefulset

### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n This PR seeks to improve the performance of serving the application list in History Server by storing the required information of the application as part of HDFS extended attributes instead of parsing the log file each time.\r\n\r\n ### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n Improves the performance of the History Server listing page\r\n\r\nBelow is the comparison of the  time taken to complete `mergeApplicationListing` call [in FsHistoryProvider](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/history/FsHistoryProvider.scala#L584) that is called for every log file that is updated in the event log directory : \r\n\r\n| Event log size  | Extended Attributes disabled (in ms) | Extended Attributes enabled (in ms) |\r\n| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |\r\n| 122MB  | 1340 | 137  |\r\n| 10.2MB  | 866 | 135  |\r\n| 5.5MB  | 645  | 136 |\r\n|  0.6MB | 505 | 134 |\r\n| 0.8MB  | 525 | 137  |\r\n\r\nAs we can see in the comparison above, irrespective of the event log size, the time to build the application listing for the app remains the same. This is hugely beneficial in clusters that have very large event log sizes.\r\n\r\n ### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\n No.\r\n\r\n ### How was this patch tested?\r\n Will add unit tests","created_at":"2021-12-07T18:52:05Z","updated_at":"2022-09-30T00:36:18Z","closed_at":"2022-09-30T00:36:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"62d6ba9361f52881bea1c3997b8b698c19920cfa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34829/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34829/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34829/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2d08106703233872b939b4a28a47729fa2a72a1e","head":{"label":"thejdeep:SPARK-23607","ref":"SPARK-23607","sha":"2d08106703233872b939b4a28a47729fa2a72a1e","user":{"login":"thejdeep","id":1708757,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDg3NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1708757?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejdeep","html_url":"https://github.com/thejdeep","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejdeep/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejdeep/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejdeep/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejdeep/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejdeep/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejdeep/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejdeep/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejdeep/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejdeep/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":302781737,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMDI3ODE3Mzc=","name":"spark","full_name":"thejdeep/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"thejdeep","id":1708757,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDg3NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1708757?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejdeep","html_url":"https://github.com/thejdeep","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejdeep/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejdeep/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejdeep/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejdeep/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejdeep/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejdeep/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejdeep/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejdeep/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejdeep/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/thejdeep/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nWe can support `SortAggregateExec` code-gen without grouping keys. When there's no grouping key, sort aggregate should share same execution logic with hash aggregate.\r\n\r\nAt a high level, this PR does\r\n\r\n* `spark.sql.codegen.aggregate.sortAggregate.enabled`: a new config (user-facing) is introduced to allow users to disable sort aggregate in case anything going wrong, and it's enabled by default.\r\n*  `spark.sql.aggregate.forceApplySortAggregate`: an internal config (non-user-facing) is introduced to allow developers test sort aggregate, to improve unit test coverage of it. We already had a similar config for shuffled hash join.\r\n* `AggregateCodegenSupport.scala`: The base class to have implementation of code-gen without grouping keys and other code-gen related boilerplate code. The subclass is required to implement `doProduceWithKeys()` and `doConsumeWithKeys()` to handle aggregate with grouping keys. The implementation in this class is copied literarily from `HashAggregateExec`.\r\n* `HashAggregateExec.scala`: only keeps its original `doProduceWithKeys()` and `doConsumeWithKeys()`.\r\n* `SortAggregateExec.scala`: extends `AggregateCodegenSupport.scala` to support code-gen without grouping keys.\r\n\r\nThe implementation of `SortAggregateExec` code-gen with grouping keys will be added in follow-up PR.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo enable code-gen for sort aggregate, so we can have better query performance when sort aggregate is used.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nThe config of `spark.sql.codegen.aggregate.sortAggregate.enabled` to enable/disable sort aggregate code-gen.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nAdded unit test in `WholeStageCodegenSuite.scala`.","created_at":"2021-12-07T05:23:01Z","updated_at":"2021-12-17T19:13:12Z","closed_at":"2021-12-17T12:18:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d4c06ccaf691ee2dfde0680d0a042565a4d4c5d4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34826/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34826/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34826/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b1fc0a978012a6ef86bea7b98240ac4da0266ea1","head":{"label":"c21:sort-agg-codegen","ref":"sort-agg-codegen","sha":"b1fc0a978012a6ef86bea7b98240ac4da0266ea1","user":{"login":"c21","id":4629931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2Mjk5MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4629931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21","html_url":"https://github.com/c21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":159474643,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTk0NzQ2NDM=","name":"spark","full_name":"c21/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"c21","id":4629931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2Mjk5MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4629931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21","html_url":"https://github.com/c21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/c21/spark","description":"Mirror

The reason is that:\r\n1. We infer additional predicates with `Generate`. In this case, it's `size(array(cast(_1#21 as string), _2#22, _3#23, ...) > 0`\r\n2. Because of the cast, the `ConstantFolding` rule can't optimize this `size(array(...))`.\r\n3. We end up with a plan containing this part\r\n```\r\n   +- Project [_1#21 AS a#106, _2#22 AS b#107, _3#23 AS c#108, _4#24 AS d#109, _5#25 AS e#110, _6#26 AS f#111, _7#27 AS g#112, _8#28 AS h#113, _9#29 AS i#114, _10#30 AS j#115, _11#31 AS k#116, _12#32 AS l#117, _13#33 AS m#118, _14#34 AS n#119, _15#35 AS o#120, _16#36 AS p#121, _17#37 AS q#122, _18#38 AS r#123, _19#39 AS s#124, _20#40 AS t#125, _21#41 AS u#126]\r\n      +- Filter (size(array(cast(_1#21 as string), _2#22, _3#23, _4#24, _5#25, _6#26, _7#27, _8#28, _9#29, _10#30, _11#31, _12#32, _13#33, _14#34, _15#35, _16#36, _17#37, _18#38, _19#39, _20#40, _21#41), true) > 0)\r\n         +- LogicalRDD [_1#21, _2#22, _3#23, _4#24, _5#25, _6#26, _7#27, _8#28, _9#29, _10#30, _11#31, _12#32, _13#33, _14#34, _15#35, _16#36, _17#37, _18#38, _19#39, _20#40, _21#41] \r\n```\r\nWhen calculating the constraints of the `Project`, we generate around 2^20 expressions, due to this code\r\n```\r\nvar allConstraints = child.constraints\r\nprojectList.foreach {\r\n  case a @ Alias(l: Literal, _) =>\r\n    allConstraints += EqualNullSafe(a.toAttribute, l)\r\n  case a @ Alias(e, _) =>\r\n    // For every alias in `projectList`, replace the reference in constraints by its attribute.\r\n    allConstraints ++= allConstraints.map(_ transform {\r\n      case expr: Expression if expr.semanticEquals(e) =>\r\n        a.toAttribute\r\n    })\r\n    allConstraints += EqualNullSafe(e, a.toAttribute)\r\n  case _ => // Don't change.\r\n} \r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are 3 issues here:\r\n1. We may infer complicated predicates from `Generate`\r\n2. `ConstanFolding` rule is too conservative. At least `Cast` has no side effect with ANSI-off.\r\n3. When calculating constraints, we should have a upper bound to avoid generating too many expressions.\r\n\r\nThis fixes the first 2 issues, and leaves the third one for the future.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nfix a performance issue\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nnew tests, and run the query in JIRA ticket

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nPass `MapOutputStatistics` to `ShuffledRowRDD` in AQE code path so we can do sort according to the origin reduce partition size.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe coalesced partition can contain several reduce partitions. The preferred locations of the RDD partition should be the biggest reduce partition before coalesced. \r\n\r\nSo it can get a better data locality and reduce the network traffic.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1. Move the `DROP NAMESPACE` parsing tests from `DDLParserSuite` to `DropNamespaceParserSuite`\r\n2. Define the class `command.DropNamespaceSuiteBase` that is parent of `v1.DropNamespaceSuiteBase` and `v2.DropNamespaceSuite`.\r\n3. Define the class `v1.DropNamespaceSuiteBase` that is parent of `v1.DropNamespaceSuite` and `hive.execution.command.DropNamespaceSuite`.\r\n4. Place the v1 tests for `DROP NAMESPACE` from `DDLSuite` and v2 tests from `DataSourceV2SQLSuite` to the common trait `DropNamespaceSuiteBase`.\r\n5. Move TODO test from `DescribeNamespaceSuiteBase` to `v1.DropNamespaceSuiteBase` and `v2.DropNamespaceSuite`\r\n\r\nThe changes follow the approach of [#30287](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/30287)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. The unification will allow to run common `DROP NAMESPACE` tests for both DSv1/Hive DSv1 and DSv2\r\n2. We can detect missing features and differences between DSv1 and DSv2 implementations.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR changes `dev-run-integration-tests.sh` to allow it to take a custom Dockerfile like #34790 did.\r\nWith this change, this script accepts `--docker-file` option, which takes a path to a custom Dockerfile.\r\n```\r\n$ ./dev/run-integration-tests.sh --docker-file /path/to/dockerfile\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAs of #34790, we can specify a custom Dockerfile by `spark.kubernetes.test.dockerFile` property  when we run the K8s integration tests using Maven.\r\nWe can run the integration test via `dev-run-integration-tests.sh` but there is no way to specify a custom Dockerfile.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nConfirmed that the K8s integration tests run with the following command using `Dockerfile.java17`.\r\n```\r\ncd resource-managers/kubernetes/integration-tests\r\n./dev/dev-run-integration-tests.sh --docker-file

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to add new function `convert_timestamp()` which converts a `timestamp_ntz` from one time zone to another. The function accepts three parameters:\r\n1. `<sourceTz>`- the time zone for the input timestamp.\r\n2. `<targetTz>` - the time zone to which the input timestamp should be converted.\r\n3. `<sourceTs>` - the timestamp to convert.\r\n\r\nThe function returns a timestamp that represents the same moment in time as the input `timestamp_ntz` in the input time zone `sourceTz`, but in the destination time zone `targetTz`.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"737\" alt=\"Screenshot 2021-12-06 at 12 57 18\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1580697/144808714-aa8cff56-6476-4c85-96e4-ffe3c3623792.png\">\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> SELECT convert_timezone('Europe/Amsterdam', 'America/Los_Angeles', timestamp_ntz'2021-12-06 08:57:00');\r\n2021-12-05 23:57:00\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n`convert_timezone()` is a common SQL function provided by many other database systems, e.g.\r\n1. Redshift: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/CONVERT_TIMEZONE.html\r\n2. Snowflake: https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/convert_timezone.html\r\n\r\nThe new function will make the migration process from other systems to Spark SQL easier for users.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running new tests:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *DateTimeUtilsSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *DateExpressionsSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/testOnly *SQLQueryTestSuite -- -z timestamp-ntz.sql\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/test:testOnly

changes were proposed in this pull request?**\r\nChange the deserialization mapping for primitive type void.\r\n\r\n**Why are the changes needed?**\r\nThe void primitive type in Scala should be classOf[Unit] not classOf[Void]. Spark erroneously [map it](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/v3.2.0/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/serializer/JavaSerializer.scala#L80) differently than all other primitive types. Here is the code:\r\n```\r\nprivate object JavaDeserializationStream {\r\n  val primitiveMappings = Map[String, Class[_]](\r\n    \"boolean\" -> classOf[Boolean],\r\n    \"byte\" -> classOf[Byte],\r\n    \"char\" -> classOf[Char],\r\n    \"short\" -> classOf[Short],\r\n    \"int\" -> classOf[Int],\r\n    \"long\" -> classOf[Long],\r\n    \"float\" -> classOf[Float],\r\n    \"double\" -> classOf[Double],\r\n    \"void\" -> classOf[Void]\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n```\r\nSpark code is Here is the demonstration:\r\n```\r\nscala> classOf[Long]\r\nval res0: Class[Long] = long\r\n\r\nscala> classOf[Double]\r\nval res1: Class[Double] = double\r\n\r\nscala> classOf[Byte]\r\nval res2: Class[Byte] = byte\r\n\r\nscala> classOf[Void]\r\nval res3: Class[Void] = class java.lang.Void  <--- this is wrong\r\n\r\nscala> classOf[Unit]\r\nval res4: Class[Unit] = void <---- this is right\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt will result in Spark deserialization error if the Spark code contains void primitive type:\r\n`java.io.InvalidClassException: java.lang.Void; local class name incompatible with stream class name \"void\"`\r\n\r\n**Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?**\r\nno\r\n\r\n**How was this patch tested?**\r\nChanged test, also tested e2e with the code results deserialization error and it pass

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn current spark-sql cli interface, if the end SQL is  not a close comment, the SQL won't be passed to backend engine and just ignored. This caused a problem that if user write a SQL with wrong comment. It's just ignored and won't throw exception.\r\nFor example:\r\n```\r\nspark-sql> /* This is a comment without end symbol SELECT 1;\r\nspark-sql>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter this pr:\r\n```\r\nspark-sql> /* This is a comment without end symbol SELECT 1;\r\nError in query:\r\nUnclosed bracketed comment(line 1, pos 0)\r\n\r\n == SQL ==\r\n /* This is a comment without end symbol SELECT 1;\r\n ^^^\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn SPARK-33100 add this change https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29982\r\n\r\nHive related code\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/hive/blob/1090c93b1a02d480bdee2af2cecf503f8a54efc6/cli/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/cli/CliDriver.java#L488-L490\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nExact exceptions are thrown for wrong statements, which is convenient for users to troubleshoot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, if user write a wrong comment in sql/sql file or query in the end. \r\nBefore it's just ignored since it's not a statement. Now it will be passed to backend engine and if the statement is not correct, it will throw SQL exception.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nadded UT and  test by handle.\r\n\r\n```\r\nspark-sql> /* SELECT /*+ HINT() 4; */;\r\nError in query:\r\nmismatched input ';' expecting {'(', 'ADD', 'ALTER', 'ANALYZE', 'CACHE', 'CLEAR', 'COMMENT', 'COMMIT', 'CREATE',

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR upgrades Py4J from 0.10.9.2 to 0.10.9.3 which contains the bug fix (https://github.com/bartdag/py4j/pull/440) that directly affected us.\r\n\r\nFor example, once you cancel a cell in Jupyter, all following cells simply fail. This PR fixes the bug by upgrading Py4J.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo fix a regression in Spark 3.2.0 in notebooks like Jupyter.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nFixes a regression described in SPARK-37004\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested the fix when I land https://github.com/bartdag/py4j/pull/440 to

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to add plotly, pyarrow and pandas dependencies for generating the API documentation for pandas API on Spark.\r\n\r\nThe versions of `pandas==1.1.5 pyarrow==3.0.0 plotly==5.4.0` are matched with the current versions being used in branch-3.2 at Python 3.6.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently, the function references for pandas API on Spark are all missing: https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/pyspark.pandas/series.html due to missing dependencies when building the docs.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, the broken links of documentation at https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/pyspark.pandas/series.html will all be recovered.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTo be honest, it has not been tested. I don't have the nerve to run Docker releasing script for the sake of testing so I defer to the next release manager.\r\n\r\nThe combinations of the dependency versions are being tested in GitHub Actions at

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis pr add support set parallel through data source properties when reading data. For example:\r\n```scala\r\nspark.read.option(\"Parallel\", 1000).parquet(\"path/to/parquet\")\r\n```\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE very_large_partitioned_bucketed_table (\r\n  id STRING,\r\n  foo STRING,\r\n  bar STRING,\r\n  other STRING,\r\n  dt STRING,\r\n  type STRING)\r\nUSING parquet\r\nOPTIONS (\r\n  compression 'gzip',\r\n  PARALLEL '12000'\r\n)\r\nPARTITIONED BY (dt, type)\r\nCLUSTERED BY (id)\r\nINTO 6000 BUCKETS\r\n```\r\n\r\nOracle has similar feature:\r\nhttps://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14200/clauses006.htm\r\nhttps://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/server.112/e25523/parallel002.htm#BEIDFDEH\r\n\r\nHow to alter table parallelism:\r\n```sql\r\nALTER TABLE table_name SET TBLPROPERTIES ('parallel' = 'parallel number');\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n1. To decrease the degree of parallelism if it is very large partitioned and bucketed table as it is not always use bucket scan since [SPARK-32859](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-32859).\r\n2. To increase the degree of parallelism on the stream side if it is `BroadcastNestedLoopJoinExec`.\r\n3. To support setting parallel through hint in the future(Oracle has similar feature: https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/server.112/e41573/hintsref.htm#CHDJIGDG).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit test.\r\n","created_at":"2021-12-05T13:05:58Z","updated_at":"2022-02-24T06:18:29Z","closed_at":"2022-02-24T06:18:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d01c22d5f81657f1fb4c92cf42a0580212dd2a49","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1496047285,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDk2MDQ3Mjg1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/EXAMPLES","name":"EXAMPLES","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1984361638,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTg0MzYxNjM4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/R","name":"R","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34810/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34810/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34810/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/14ff3a0e36fa11a3a412da6a7b771bcc6f113a74","head":{"label":"wangyum:SPARK-37549","ref":"SPARK-37549","sha":"14ff3a0e36fa11a3a412da6a7b771bcc6f113a74","user":{"login":"wangyum","id":5399861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzOTk4NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5399861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum","html_url":"https://github.com/wangyum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"feba5ac32f2598f6ca8a274850934106be0db64d","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdding an additional example to demonstrate how to parse jsonStr with nested types including ArrayType and StructType.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe documentation for from_json currently contains only examples of getting struct value from jsonStr with simple schema. It can take a lot of time to figure out how to parse jsonStr with complex types, especially for beginners. This change can make the documentation more intuitive.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nIt will enrich the documentation of Spark SQL, Built-in Functions.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nThe added example shows the real query result.","created_at":"2021-12-05T12:49:26Z","updated_at":"2021-12-07T05:08:30Z","closed_at":"2021-12-06T05:48:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6ad39e489b137b55cfc592e45d67499b40b267e7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34809/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34809/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34809/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/27a355e3de5436af427d7510f1cd1f2be736cf97","head":{"label":"byyue:dev-37550","ref":"dev-37550","sha":"27a355e3de5436af427d7510f1cd1f2be736cf97","user":{"login":"byyue","id":46839413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2ODM5NDEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46839413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/byyue","html_url":"https://github.com/byyue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byyue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byyue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byyue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byyue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byyue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byyue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byyue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byyue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byyue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":404322527,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MDQzMjI1Mjc=","name":"spark","full_name":"byyue/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"byyue","id":46839413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2ODM5NDEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46839413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/byyue","html_url":"https://github.com/byyue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byyue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byyue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byyue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byyue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byyue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byyue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byyue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byyue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byyue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/byyue/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently, v2 CTAS command doesn't qualify the location:\r\n``` \r\nspark.sql(\"CREATE TABLE testcat.t USING foo LOCATION '/tmp/foo' AS SELECT id FROM source\")\r\nspark.sql(\"DESCRIBE EXTENDED testcat.t\").filter(\"col_name = 'Location'\").show\r\n\r\n+--------+-------------+-------+\r\n|col_name|    data_type|comment|\r\n+--------+-------------+-------+\r\n|Location|/tmp/foo     |       |\r\n+--------+-------------+-------+\r\n```\r\n, whereas v1 command qualifies the location as `file:/tmp/foo` which is the correct behavior since the default filesystem can change for different sessions.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR proposes to store the qualified location in order to prevent the issue where default filesystem changes for different sessions.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, now, v2 CTAS command will store qualified location:\r\n```\r\n+--------+-------------+-------+\r\n|col_name|    data_type|comment|\r\n+--------+-------------+-------+\r\n|Location|file:/tmp/foo|       |\r\n+--------+-------------+-------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nAdded new

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nOptimize the dynamic partitioning pruning rule to avoid inserting unnecessary predicates to improve performance.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, the dynamic partition pruning rule will insert a predicate on the filterable table using the filter from the other side of the join , and the predicate will be re-optimized by the AQE or non-AQE.\r\n\r\nBut, the predicate may be unnecessary if the join can NOT reuse broadcastExchange or it is not benefit, and it will be removed by the rules of the AQE or non-AQE, so we should  optimize the dynamic partition pruning rule to avoid inserting unnecessary predicate to improve performance.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNO\r\n\r\n### How

However, when building with Hadoop/YARN 2.2 Maven doesn't correctly bump\r\n  the protobuf version up from the one Mesos gives. For now we include this variable\r\n  to explicitly bump the version when building with YARN. It would be nice to figure\r\n  out why Maven can't resolve this correctly (like SBT does). -->\r\n<dependency>\r\n  <groupId>com.google.protobuf</groupId>\r\n  <artifactId>protobuf-java</artifactId>\r\n  <version>${protobuf.version}</version>\r\n  <scope>${hadoop.deps.scope}</scope>\r\n</dependency>\r\n```\r\n\r\nRecently (2021-08-11), in security patch,\r\n- `com.google.crypto.tink` added this dependency to `network-common` module, but seems unused in the runtime.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIn the `Optimizer` replace all instances of `Expand` with only 1 projection with a `Project`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nBoth grouping sets and distinct aggregations can create `Expand` with only 1 projection. Removing those can improve the performance in two ways:\r\n* Enable optimization rules, that can not work with `Expand`\r\n* Avoid unnecessary copying - `ExpandExec` has `needCopyResult: Boolean = true`\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nNew

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdd New SQL functions `try_element_at`, which is identical to the `element_at` except that it returns null if error occurs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAfter some data science on real world SQL queries, we found that some users are using the following queries\r\n```\r\nselect ... where mapCol.key is not null\r\nselect ... where arrayCol[index] is not null\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, an alternative function `try_element_at` which will return null on array index out of bound or map key doesn't exist under ANSI mode.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUnit

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIn general, the larger input data size means longer running time. So ideally, we can let DAGScheduler submit bigger input size task first. It can reduce the whole stage running time.\r\n\r\n[design doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vPcuEADUokO4XpqBV1rFH90Zi4rKdsgZtZMYX80c2gw/edit?usp=sharing)\r\n\r\nthis pr add two cases as initialization implementation:\r\n- datasourcev1 file scan for leaf node\r\n- coalesce partition spec for AQE\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFor example, we have one stage with 4 tasks and the defaultParallelism is 2 and the 4 tasks have different running time [1s, 3s, 2s, 4s].\r\n- in normal, the running time of the stage is: 7s\r\n  - 1, 2\r\n  - 3, 4\r\n- if big task first, the running time of the stage is: 5s\r\n  - 4, 1\r\n  - 3, 2\r\n\r\nIn worse, if we have a skewed task set [1s, 3s, 3s, 7s, 7s, 20s] with the 2 defaultParallelism:\r\n-  in normal, the running time of the stage is: 31s\r\n   - 1, 3, 7, 20\r\n   - 3, 3, 7\r\n- if big task first, the running time of the stage is: 21s\r\n  - 20, 1\r\n  - 7, 7, 3, 3\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nyes, a new config `spark.scheduler.sortTasksByInputSize.enabled` at core module to decide if we allow to sort tasks.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdd test in:\r\n\r\n- org.apache.spark.scheduler.DAGSchedulerSuite\r\n-

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR aims to support K8s integration tests for Java 17 using Maven and SBT.\r\nThe new system property `spark.kubernetes.test.dockerFile` is introduced to specify a Dockerfile.\r\nBy setting `Dockerfile.java17` to the property, the integration tests run with Java 17.\r\n\r\nThis PR also revised the change brought by SPARK-37354 (#34628) by changing `SparkBuild.scala` so that it can recognize the system property `spark.kubernetes.test.javaImageTag`, like the integration tests with Maven do.\r\n\r\nIf both `spark.kubernetes.test.dockerFile` and `spark.kubernetes.test.javaImageTag` are set, `spark.kubernetes.test.dockerFile` is preferred.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo ensure Spark works on K8s with Java 17.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nConfirmed that the intended version of Java is used for each pattern.\r\n* Neither

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSupport optimize skewed partitions in Distribution and Ordering if numPartitions is not specified\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhen doing repartition in distribution and sort, we will use Rebalance operator instead of RepartitionByExpression to optimize skewed partitions when\r\n1. numPartitions is not specified by the data source, and\r\n2. sortOrder is specified. This is because the requested distribution needs to be guaranteed, which can only be achieved by using RangePartitioning, not HashPartitioning.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, Spark supports push down filters, aggregates and limit. All the job is completed by `V2ScanRelationPushDown`.\r\nBut `V2ScanRelationPushDown` have a lot limit.\r\nUsers want apply custom rule for push down after `V2ScanRelationPushDown` failed.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nEasy for users to apply custom pushdown rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n'Yes'.\r\nUsers can inject custom early scan pushdown rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis is a follow-up PR to https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/34596. There were a few comments and suggestions raised after the PR was merged, so I addressed them in this follow-up:\r\n- Instead of using `failOnError`, which was confusing as no error was thrown in the method, we use `allowTimeZone` which has an opposite meaning of `failOnError` and far more descriptive.\r\n- I updated a few test names to resolve ambiguity.\r\n- I changed the tests to use `withTempPath` as was suggested in the original PR.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCode cleanup and clarifications.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nExisting unit and integration

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to use [Python's standard string formatter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#custom-string-formatting) in `SparkSession.sql`, see also https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/34677.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo improve usability in PySpark. It works together with Python standard string formatter.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nBy default, there is no user-facing change. If `kwargs` is specified, yes.\r\n\r\n1. Attribute supports from frame (standard Python support):\r\n\r\n    ```python\r\n    mydf = spark.range(10)\r\n    spark.sql(\"SELECT {tbl.id}, {tbl[id]} FROM {tbl}\", tbl=mydf)\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n2. Understanding `DataFrame`:\r\n\r\n    ```python\r\n    mydf = spark.range(10)\r\n    spark.sql(\"SELECT * FROM {tbl}\", tbl=mydf)\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n3. Understanding `Column`. (explicit column reference only):\r\n\r\n    ```python\r\n    mydf = spark.range(10)\r\n    spark.sql(\"SELECT {c} FROM {tbl}\", c=col(\"id\"), tbl=mydf)\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n4. Leveraging other Python string format:\r\n\r\n    ```python\r\n    mydf = spark.range(10)\r\n    spark.sql(\r\n        \"SELECT {col} FROM {mydf} WHERE id IN {x}\",\r\n        col=mydf.id, mydf=mydf, x=tuple(range(4)))\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nDoctests were

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR used to fix the issue\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/33588#issuecomment-978719988\r\n\r\nThe root cause is Orc write/read timestamp with local timezone in default. The local timezone will be changed.\r\nIf the Orc writer write timestamp with local timezone(e.g. America/Los_Angeles), when the Orc reader reading the timestamp with local timezone(e.g. Europe/Amsterdam), the value of timestamp will be different.\r\n\r\nIf we let the Orc writer write timestamp with UTC timezone, when the Orc reader reading the timestamp with  UTC timezone too, the value of timestamp will be correct.\r\n\r\nThis PR let Orc write/read Timestamp with UTC timezone by call `useUTCTimestamp(true)` for readers or writers.\r\n\r\nThe related Orc source:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/orc/blob/3f1e57cf1cebe58027c1bd48c09eef4e9717a9e3/java/core/src/java/org/apache/orc/impl/WriterImpl.java#L525\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/orc/blob/1f68ac0c7f2ae804b374500dcf1b4d7abe30ffeb/java/core/src/java/org/apache/orc/impl/TreeReaderFactory.java#L1184\r\n\r\nAnother problem is Spark 3.3 or newer read the Orc file written by Spark 3.2 or prior. Because the older Spark write timestamp with local timezone, no need to read them with UTC timezone. Otherwise, an incorrect value of timestamp occurs.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFix the bug for Orc timestamp.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nOrc timestamp ntz is a new feature not release yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew tests.\r\n","created_at":"2021-12-01T12:16:54Z","updated_at":"2022-03-12T01:54:27Z","closed_at":"2022-03-12T01:54:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0a47631b80f014f10476543b1320bbcbe49dd539","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34769/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/34769/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/34769/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5347110de30022524ca5249988ee996ecf5467b1","head":{"label":"beliefer:SPARK-37463-utc","ref":"SPARK-37463-utc","sha":"5347110de30022524ca5249988ee996ecf5467b1","user":{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":237617513,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzc2MTc1MTM=","name":"spark","full_name":"beliefer/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer/spark","description":"Apache

We add a method `getApplicationId` to get `appId` from `Client`, and avoid it can be changed outside of `Client`.\r\n2. `submitApplication()` don't return `appId` now. we need to call `getApplicationId` instead.\r\n3. Remove `appId` argument from `monitorApplication()` and `getApplicationReport()`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nRefactor code.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR fixes an issue that `CollectMetrics` performs twice if it's followed by global sort like as follows.\r\n```\r\nval df = spark.range(100)\r\n  .observe(\r\n    name = \"my_event\",\r\n    min($\"id\").as(\"min_val\"),\r\n    max($\"id\").as(\"max_val\"),\r\n    sum($\"id\"),\r\n    count(when($\"id\" % 2 === 0, 1)).as(\"num_even\"))\r\n  .sort($\"id\".desc)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe expected statistics calculated by `CollectMetrics` is `[0,99,4950,50]` but the actual result is `[0,99,9900,100]`.\r\nThe reason is that jobs for sampling can run before the global sort, which performs extra `CollectMetrics`.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/e7fa28930dce468df02b5915e1792ada758a96e3/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/Partitioner.scala#L171\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/e7fa28930dce468df02b5915e1792ada758a96e3/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/Partitioner.scala#L195\r\n\r\nThe solution this PR proposes to introduce a property `spark.job.isSamplingJob` which is intended to be get/set internally.\r\nBefore the sampling jobs run, Spark sets the property, and reset it after the jobs finish.\r\nThen, `CollectMetrics` can judge a task is whether of a sampling job or not.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nBug fix.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nNew

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to improve `Fallback Storage` upload speed by randomizing the path in order to avoid S3 rate limiter.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently, `Fallback Storage` is using `a single prefix per shuffle`. This PR aims to randomize the upload prefixes even in a single shuffle to avoid S3 rate limiter.\r\n- https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/s3-request-limit-avoid-throttling/\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo. This is used internally during the runtime.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs to verify read and write operations. To check the layout, check the uploaded path manually with the following configs.\r\n\r\n```\r\nspark.decommission.enabled                          true\r\nspark.storage.decommission.enabled                  true\r\nspark.storage.decommission.shuffleBlocks.enabled    true\r\nspark.storage.decommission.fallbackStorage.path     file:///tmp/fallback/\r\n```\r\n\r\nStart one master and worker. Connect with `spark-shell` and generate shuffle data.\r\n```\r\nscala> sc.parallelize(1 to 11, 10).map(x => (x % 3, 1)).reduceByKey(_ + _).count()\r\nres0: Long = 3\r\n```\r\n\r\nInvoke decommission and check. Since we have only one worker, the shuffle data go to the fallback storage directly.\r\n```\r\n$ kill -PWR <CoarseGrainedExecutorBackend JVM PID>\r\n$ tree /tmp/fallback\r\n/tmp/fallback\r\n└──

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd `CONTAINS` string function.\r\n\r\n| function| arguments | Returns |\r\n|-------|-------|-------|\r\n| CONTAINS( left , right) | left: String, right: String | Returns a BOOLEAN. The value is True if right is found inside left. Returns NULL if either input expression is NULL. Otherwise, returns False.|\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\ncontains() is a common convenient function supported by a number of database systems:\r\n\r\n- https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/functions-and-operators#contains_substr\r\n- https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/contains.html\r\n\r\nSupport of the function can make the migration from other systems to Spark SQL easier.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nUser can use `contains(left, right)`:\r\n\r\n| Left   |      Right      |  Return |\r\n|----------|:-------------:|------:|\r\n| null |  \"Spark SQL\" | null |\r\n| \"Spark SQL\" |  null | null |\r\n| null |  null | null |\r\n| \"Spark SQL\" |  \"Spark\" | true

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSimilar to SPARK-33346, there are still some `var` that can be replaced by `val` in the current code base, so this pr turn these  from `var` to  `val`.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nUse `val` instead of `var` when possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- Pass the Jenkins or GitHub Action\r\n\r\n- Manual test: compile a client and manually execute `bin/run-example MiniReadWriteTest README.md`,  the behavior is consistent before and after this PR\r\n","created_at":"2021-11-30T11:51:40Z","updated_at":"2023-10-22T07:43:23Z","closed_at":"2021-12-07T04:18:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c07c9d7f14c92de22fc466d443b03777c46b9647","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1405801475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/ML","name":"ML","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1405803268,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAzMjY4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/MLLIB","name":"MLLIB","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nEnhance semantic equals at `Partitioning` to support cast aware output partitioning and required if it can up cast.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIf a `Cast` is up cast then it should be without any truncating or precision lose or possible runtime failures. So the output partitioning should be same with/without `Cast` if the `Cast` is up cast.\r\n\r\nLet's say we have a query:\r\n```sql\r\n-- v1: c1 int\r\n-- v2: c2 long\r\n\r\nSELECT * FROM v2 JOIN (SELECT c1, count(*) FROM v1 GROUP BY c1) v1 ON v1.c1 = v2.c2\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe executed plan contains three shuffle nodes which looks like:\r\n```sql\r\nSortMergeJoin\r\n  Exchange(cast(c1 as bigint))\r\n    HashAggregate\r\n      Exchange(c1)\r\n        Scan v1\r\n  Exchange(c2)\r\n    Scan v2\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can simplify the plan using two shuffle nodes:\r\n```sql\r\nSortMergeJoin\r\n  HashAggregate\r\n    Exchange(c1)\r\n      Scan v1\r\n  Exchange(c2)\r\n    Scan v2\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nyes, the plan may be changed\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord
