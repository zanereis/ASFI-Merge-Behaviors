changes as #2019, but for 3.6-dev instead, as there was an added null check in hasId() for 3.6, which led to changes to the Gherkin test suites. \r\n\r\nIt appears that the previous implementation of hasId() omitted adding `null` to the Bytecode step if `otherIds` were `null`, which unintentionally removed tailing nulls from traversals and in the test files.\r\n\r\nI'll squash all commits into one

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TINKERPOP-2899\r\n\r\nIn some instances, a graph may contain elements whose Ids are sequentially increasing integers. Because the hashCode for Path implementations are calculated based on these same Ids, you run into a situation where both parts of the hashCode calculation are related by some constant. H(A)-H(B)=C where C is a constant. In this case, XOR is a bad candidate for creating the final hashCode because XOR will reduce to some small pool of potential output. This occurs because the most significant bits will be the same for H(A) and H(B) which will cause them to become 0 when XOR'd.

of the optimizations done by TinkerGraphStepStrategy is push down `has()` steps into HasContainer's within TinkerGraphStep. When this occurs, the normal binary reduction of ternary boolean states gets skipped. This PR addresses this by replicating the binary reduction logic within TinkerGraphStep when the filtering is performed.\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses cases where `GremlinTypeErrorException` is able to leak to the user.\r\n\r\nFixes 2 cases:\r\n1: If has step gets merged into a TinkerGraphStep by TinkerGraphStepStrategy, the evaluation\r\nof the has containers will still be guarded by the same ternary boolean binary reduction logic\r\nas in FilterStep class.\r\n\r\n2: If the parent step is not a FilterStep and thus is not equipped to handle a GremlinTypeErrorException,\r\nthe error will be reduced to false instead of

spotify plugin with io.fabric8 docker-maven-plugin. The new plugin has the benefit of supporting multi-arch images through buildx for deployments and it is an actively maintained plugin as opposed to the spotify plugin.\r\n\r\nThe new plugin continues to fetch auth credentials from the same location so no changes to the release environment will be necessary.\r\n\r\nI have tested the full set of .Net gherkin and integration tests against the new server image with no issues. I have also used [container-diff](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/container-diff) to compare the new image to the one that we currently build using the mvn exec plugin and docker compose.

I can investigate this further if anyone views it as a potential concern.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the ARM64 console image has been unstable in my tests and I've opted to exclude it for now. The configuration for multi-arch console images is still included in this PR so an ARM console image can be added to the deployment in the future with a one liner update.\r\n\r\nAdditional architectures such as `ppc64le` could be added to the deployment simply by listing them in the `docker.platforms` property in the console and server poms. I would expect all architectures supported by the [alpine](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine) base image should work although I lack the resources to test this.","created_at":"2023-03-29T21:42:25Z","updated_at":"2023-05-19T16:58:28Z","closed_at":"2023-04-26T01:29:30Z","merged_at":"2023-04-26T01:29:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"6045c11deb37b2876bde5186975a8546d6a83c87","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/2007/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/2007/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/2007/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/statuses/b2a69c42b36cf7b04262bf6eda53e754104efee5","head":{"label":"Bit-Quill:cole/updateDockerPlugin","ref":"cole/updateDockerPlugin","sha":"b2a69c42b36cf7b04262bf6eda53e754104efee5","user":{"login":"Bit-Quill","id":63763473,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYzNzYzNDcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63763473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill","html_url":"https://github.com/Bit-Quill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":506343924,"node_id":"R_kgDOHi4x9A","name":"tinkerpop","full_name":"Bit-Quill/tinkerpop","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Bit-Quill","id":63763473,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYzNzYzNDcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63763473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill","html_url":"https://github.com/Bit-Quill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Bit-Quill/tinkerpop","description":"Apache

creates an `AuthInfoProvider` interface with the methods necessary to read credential/header information, changes the `AuthInfo` signature slightly to satisfy that interface, and updates call sites so that each call site calls the necessary interface method to re-read the credentials.\r\n\r\nThe interface looks like:\r\n```go\r\ntype AuthInfoProvider interface {\r\n\tGetHeader() http.Header\r\n\tGetBasicAuth() (ok bool, username, password string)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt also adds a new `NewDynamicAuth(f func() AuthInfoProvider)` helper function that creates a generator based `AuthInfoProvider`, so that each time `GetHeader()` or `GetBasicAuth()` methods are called the given function is called to get a brand new `AuthInfoProvider` (which itself can be `AuthInfo` or something else) and the results are relayed to the caller.\r\n\r\nWith this, `AuthInfo`-related constructors (`BasicAuthInfo()` and `HeaderAuthInfo()`) are unchanged, but there's now the ability to have any object provide the values (implementing `AuthInfoProvider`) and they are called on-demand for each connection attempt, as opposed to having them as static values.\r\n\r\nNote: This is my first contribution, and I couldn't get the local gremlin-server to play nicely to get the tests to run, but I've tried it elsewhere with AWS Neptune auth, like so:\r\n\r\n```go\r\n// ... code to set up aws-sdk-v2 credential chain ...\r\n\t\tsigner := v4.NewSigner()\r\n\r\n\t\tgen := func() gremlingo.AuthInfoProvider {\r\n\t\t\tif err := signer.SignHTTP(ctx, cr, req, emptyStringSHA256, \"neptune-db\", \"us-east-1\", time.Now()); err != nil {\r\n\t\t\t\tpanic(err) // not ideal, but it's always nil\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\treturn gremlingo.HeaderAuthInfo(req.Header)\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\treturn gremlingo.NewDynamicAuth(gen), nil\r\n```","created_at":"2023-03-13T21:32:01Z","updated_at":"2023-03-15T07:47:18Z","closed_at":"2023-03-14T23:55:14Z","merged_at":"2023-03-14T23:55:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"4eca81bee0d0fa7c9f83f64fae6528a5c1f7e8f9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/1989/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/1989/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1989/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/statuses/f792d7595e22f8671bea34d151ff91576d6dcc2a","head":{"label":"disq:TINKERPOP-2747","ref":"TINKERPOP-2747","sha":"f792d7595e22f8671bea34d151ff91576d6dcc2a","user":{"login":"disq","id":223029,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzAyOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/223029?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/disq","html_url":"https://github.com/disq","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/disq/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/disq/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/disq/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/disq/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/disq/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/disq/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/disq/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/disq/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/disq/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":613562871,"node_id":"R_kgDOJJI59w","name":"tinkerpop","full_name":"disq/tinkerpop","private":false,"owner":{"login":"disq","id":223029,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzAyOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/223029?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/disq","html_url":"https://github.com/disq","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/disq/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/disq/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/disq/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/disq/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/disq/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/disq/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/disq/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/disq/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/disq/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/disq/tinkerpop","description":"Apache

picking previously approved changed to 3.6-dev to resolve conflicts.\r\n\r\nFixes TINKERPOP-2767.\r\n\r\nThe existing error handling in TraversalOpProcessor and SessionOpProcessor during bytecode iteration was catching all exceptions sending an appropriate error response to the client. The OpProcessor however was not catching a StackOverflowError which could be induced by running a query which contains a large repeat step. This Error was being caught by FutureTask.run() but GremlinServer never wait's on this task or checks the results which caused this Error to be lost. A similar issue was found to exist in AbstractSession.process().\r\n\r\nThis commit adjusts the existing error handling code to catch any Throwable during bytecode iteration so clients will receive error messages and codes for server errors as well as exceptions. Any errors are re-thrown such that the evalFuture FutureTask will continue to have an exception set correctly (although GremlinServer currently does not use this for anything).\r\n","created_at":"2023-02-23T22:13:55Z","updated_at":"2023-05-19T16:58:54Z","closed_at":"2023-02-24T17:56:40Z","merged_at":"2023-02-24T17:56:40Z","merge_commit_sha":"d1479f4706ec243e14e780429876639db67edc5e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/1979/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/1979/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1979/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/statuses/21399e5b275495e16c51082feb792da92c6d50de","head":{"label":"Bit-Quill:cole/stackOverflowError-3.6","ref":"cole/stackOverflowError-3.6","sha":"21399e5b275495e16c51082feb792da92c6d50de","user":{"login":"Bit-Quill","id":63763473,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYzNzYzNDcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63763473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill","html_url":"https://github.com/Bit-Quill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":506343924,"node_id":"R_kgDOHi4x9A","name":"tinkerpop","full_name":"Bit-Quill/tinkerpop","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Bit-Quill","id":63763473,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYzNzYzNDcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63763473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill","html_url":"https://github.com/Bit-Quill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Bit-Quill/tinkerpop","description":"Apache

picking previously approved changed to 3.6-dev to resolve conflicts.\r\n\r\nFixes TINKERPOP-2767.\r\n\r\nThe existing error handling in TraversalOpProcessor and SessionOpProcessor during bytecode iteration was catching all exceptions sending an appropriate error response to the client. The OpProcessor however was not catching a StackOverflowError which could be induced by running a query which contains a large repeat step. This Error was being caught by FutureTask.run() but GremlinServer never wait's on this task or checks the results which caused this Error to be lost. A similar issue was found to exist in AbstractSession.process().\r\n\r\nThis commit adjusts the existing error handling code to catch any Throwable during bytecode iteration so clients will receive error messages and codes for server errors as well as exceptions. Any errors are re-thrown such that the evalFuture FutureTask will continue to have an exception set correctly (although GremlinServer currently does not use this for anything).","created_at":"2023-02-22T01:20:37Z","updated_at":"2023-02-22T01:32:22Z","closed_at":"2023-02-22T01:32:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"52b50aa91cf745c69ee2b2508cd70825148a4558","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/1976/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/1976/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1976/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/statuses/69c5f35ce4ebadac44aa026523a43e9440546b38","head":{"label":"Bit-Quill:cole/stackOverflowError-3.6","ref":"cole/stackOverflowError-3.6","sha":"69c5f35ce4ebadac44aa026523a43e9440546b38","user":{"login":"Bit-Quill","id":63763473,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYzNzYzNDcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63763473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill","html_url":"https://github.com/Bit-Quill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":506343924,"node_id":"R_kgDOHi4x9A","name":"tinkerpop","full_name":"Bit-Quill/tinkerpop","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Bit-Quill","id":63763473,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYzNzYzNDcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63763473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill","html_url":"https://github.com/Bit-Quill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Bit-Quill/tinkerpop","description":"Apache

establish wrapping consistency between opening block statements and else blocks by\ngrouping params in opening blocks. This causes params to break to a new line together and not be split across lines\nunless the length of params exceeds the print width. This also updates the else block wrapping to behave exactly the\nsame as opening blocks.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<pre lang=\"hbs\"><code>{{!

href=\"https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j/releases\">neo4j-kernel's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Neo4j 1.9.0 stable release</h2>\n<p>The 1.9 release of Neo4j builds upon the previous 1.8 releases and brings extensive improvements in stability and performance. In addition, <em>Neo4j 1.9 Enterprise</em> introduces auto-clustering support, with dramatically simplified configuration and deployment for high demand production use.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Support for <a href=\"http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/1.9/ha.html\">auto-clustering in <em>Neo4j Enterprise</em></a>, which replaces the previous Zookeeper based HA clustering, provides a streamlined deployment process and is much safer and more resilient in failure scenarios.</li>\n<li>New <a href=\"http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/1.9/arbiter-instances.html\">neo4j-arbiter</a> tool, which acts as a voting instance in a Neo4j cluster but does not keep a data store or handle transactions.</li>\n<li>Addition of <a href=\"http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/1.9/query-function.html\">string manipulation, timestamp and other functions</a> to the Cypher query language.</li>\n<li>Improvements to memory utilization, which reduces working memory requirements and improves overall performance.</li>\n<li>New <a href=\"http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/1.9/ha-rest-info.html\">REST endpoints for inspecting cluster status information</a> (master, slave, etc).</li>\n<li>Correction of several concurrency and performance issues.</li>\n<li>Improvements to <a href=\"http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/1.9/operations-backup.html\">Online Backup</a> in <em>Neo4j Enterprise</em>, including auto-detection of full vs incremental backup based on existing content at the backup location.</li>\n<li>Updates to Neo4j server webadmin, including welcome pages for new users.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>It is recommended to upgrade all previous Neo4j installations to this release.</strong> Neo4j 1.9 does not require any explicit upgrade to persistent stores created using Neo4j 1.7 and 1.8 installations, however <em>current users of Neo4j Enterprise must consult the documentation and update the cluster configuration</em>. Please see the <a href=\"http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/1.9/deployment.html\">deployment</a> and <a href=\"http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/1.9/upgrade-guide.html\">cluster upgrade</a> sections of the Neo4j manual for more detail.

new workflow which runs CodeQL vulnerability scanning on any pushes or pull requests to master, 3.5-dev, or 3.6-dev.\r\n\r\nAlso includes a small fix in go to prevent a possible lossy type conversion.\r\n\r\nCodeQL will result in a failing check if a push or PR introduces a new vulnerability. It will not fail the checks for vulnerabilities which were pre-existing in the branch. Existing vulnerabilities are tracked and listed in Github under Security -> Vulnerability and Alerts -> Code scanning (Only visible to committers)\r\n\r\nThere are 3 vulnerabilities which have been found in the initial scan. I would ask that a committer dismiss the go warning as a \"false positive\". The warning is due to a potentially unsafe type conversion from a uint64 to a uint. During it's initialization, the size of the uint64 is being bounded to the size of uint making a lossy conversion impossible.\r\n\r\nThe remaining 2 vulnerabilities are due to inefficient regex in prism.js which is is included in our sources as part of the website. This seems like a low priority to me and I would suggest we either dismiss these warnings as \"won't do\" or leave them open for added visibility with no immediate plan for a patch.","created_at":"2023-01-17T20:29:11Z","updated_at":"2023-05-19T17:01:06Z","closed_at":"2023-02-03T19:58:44Z","merged_at":"2023-02-03T19:58:44Z","merge_commit_sha":"5f2ff7715f0c3d65769baea619151cdff2561b62","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/1947/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/1947/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1947/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/statuses/45d6b8db017dcff4737ddc90fe1041ae398c1cf9","head":{"label":"Bit-Quill:cole/codeQl","ref":"cole/codeQl","sha":"45d6b8db017dcff4737ddc90fe1041ae398c1cf9","user":{"login":"Bit-Quill","id":63763473,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYzNzYzNDcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63763473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill","html_url":"https://github.com/Bit-Quill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":506343924,"node_id":"R_kgDOHi4x9A","name":"tinkerpop","full_name":"Bit-Quill/tinkerpop","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Bit-Quill","id":63763473,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYzNzYzNDcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63763473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill","html_url":"https://github.com/Bit-Quill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Bit-Quill/tinkerpop","description":"Apache

existing error handling in TraversalOpProcessor and SessionOpProcessor during bytecode iteration was catching all exceptions sending an appropriate error response to the client. The OpProcessor however was not catching a StackOverflowError which could be induced by running a query which contains a large repeat step. This Error was being caught by FutureTask.run() but GremlinServer never wait's on this task or checks the results which caused this Error to be lost. A similar issue was found to exist in AbstractSession.process().\r\n\r\nThis PR adjusts the existing error handling code to catch any Throwable during bytecode iteration so clients will receive error messages and codes for server errors as well as exceptions. Any errors are re-thrown such that the evalFuture FutureTask will continue to have an exception set correctly (although GremlinServer currently does not use this for anything).\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-16T22:10:37Z","updated_at":"2023-05-19T16:58:56Z","closed_at":"2023-02-22T01:03:04Z","merged_at":"2023-02-22T01:03:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"3c9731f3745520fbcca536b83ca404095546fa15","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/1946/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/1946/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1946/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/statuses/c12e08cb558ae820bf6fd05bb77518a9eed61de2","head":{"label":"Bit-Quill:cole/stackOverflow","ref":"cole/stackOverflow","sha":"c12e08cb558ae820bf6fd05bb77518a9eed61de2","user":{"login":"Bit-Quill","id":63763473,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYzNzYzNDcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63763473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill","html_url":"https://github.com/Bit-Quill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":506343924,"node_id":"R_kgDOHi4x9A","name":"tinkerpop","full_name":"Bit-Quill/tinkerpop","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Bit-Quill","id":63763473,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYzNzYzNDcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63763473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill","html_url":"https://github.com/Bit-Quill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Bit-Quill/tinkerpop","description":"Apache

my testing, the go glv was not sending per-request options correctly to the server. Go was passing request options inside the gremlin script bindings map instead of within the args portion of the request message.\r\n\r\nThis PR re-implements the per-request settings by adding new Client.SubmitWithOptions() and DriverRemoteConnection.SubmitWithOptions() methods. Both original Submit() methods are unchanged in their behavior so this will not break any users.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new `RequestOptions` struct and builder which is used to configure per-request settings and passed into the new SubmitWithOptions() methods.","created_at":"2023-01-11T23:49:37Z","updated_at":"2023-02-09T19:30:21Z","closed_at":"2023-02-09T19:30:20Z","merged_at":"2023-02-09T19:30:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"81fc43686356f8709c34617d930f8eb01446351e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/1939/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/1939/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/issues/1939/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tinkerpop/statuses/c16da29f190d071e9005917497c36e77da24918d","head":{"label":"Bit-Quill:cole/go-per-request-settings","ref":"cole/go-per-request-settings","sha":"c16da29f190d071e9005917497c36e77da24918d","user":{"login":"Bit-Quill","id":63763473,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYzNzYzNDcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63763473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill","html_url":"https://github.com/Bit-Quill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":506343924,"node_id":"R_kgDOHi4x9A","name":"tinkerpop","full_name":"Bit-Quill/tinkerpop","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Bit-Quill","id":63763473,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYzNzYzNDcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63763473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill","html_url":"https://github.com/Bit-Quill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bit-Quill/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Bit-Quill/tinkerpop","description":"Apache

was observed in the java driver that the UserAgent class could fail to load if the manifest file was excluded from the jar. This is because the user agent relies on the manifest to extract the current version of gremlin. This PR adds a bit of extra error handling and will insert a value of \"NotAvailable\" in case of any failures. A similar issue was also present in JS which is also fixed here.\r\n\r\nThis PR also updates Gremlin.version() to return \"VersionNotFound\" if the manifest read fails as this is preferable to the current behavior of throwing a ExceptionInInitializerError.\r\n\r\nThanks @kenhuuu for discovering this
