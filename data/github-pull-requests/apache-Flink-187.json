To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](http://flink.apache.org/contribute-code.html#best-practices).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFor deprecated snapshots that are no longer in use (but till kept around for read backwards compatibility), we delegate the compatibility check to its newer replacements.\r\nFor example, the now deprecated `CollectionTypeSerializerConfigSnapshot` delegates compatibility check to the new `ListSerializerSnapshot` if the new serializer to be checked is a `ListSerializer`.\r\n\r\nConcretely, the delegation occurs by instantiating an instance of the new snapshot, let it wrap information that was read by the deprecated snapshot class, and let compatibility checks go through the new snapshot's `resolveSchemaCompatibility` method.\r\n\r\nThere are a few places where the delegation is actually incorrect, because the instantiated new snapshot wrapped information from the new serializer, instead of wrapping information in the legacy snapshot.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- 54ab497: A preliminary fix to the test files of `CompositeTypeSerializerMigrationTest`. Specifically, the test files generated for the `EitherSerializer` were using incorrect left / right serializers. This problem only surfaced after applying the fix in this PR.\r\n- 9b32f0c: Main gist is that a utility method `CompositeTypeSerializerUtil.delegateCompatibilityCheckToNewSnapshot ` is introduced, which handles the delegation. The caller (in legacy snapshots) provides the new serializer to check compatibility for, an instance of the new snapshot to delegate the check to and which already contains outer snapshot information read by the legacy snapshot, as well as an array of nested snapshots read by the legacy snapshot. The utility method builds a valid `CompositeTypeSerializerSnapshot` which is capable of being delegated the compatibility check for the new serializer.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAll subclasses of `TypeSerializerSnapshotMigrationTestBase` should still be passing.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: yes\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: yes\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n##

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this PR is to harden kafka ITCases. It targets probable kafka AdminClient connection issues.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nLogs from failures show that even though the request never finishes,\r\nkafka topics are actually deleted. Therefore this PR adds timeout on\r\ndelete request. If the request times out we check if the topic actually\r\nexists. If not then we continue as if the delete request succeeded.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nCurrent kafka ITCases still pass.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no /** don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

HadoopRecoverableWriter to write to Hadoop compatible Filesystems.\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\nAt a client we're using Flink jobs to read data from Kafka and writing it to GCS. In earlier versions, we've used `BucketingFileSink` for this, but we want to switch to the newer `StreamingFileSink`.\r\n\r\nSince we're running Flink on Google's DataProc, we're using the Hadoop compatible GCS [connector](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/bigdata-interop/tree/master/gcs) made by Google. This currently doesn't work on Flink, because Flink checks for a HDFS scheme at `HadoopRecoverableWriter`.\r\n\r\nWe've successfully ran our jobs by creating a custom Flink Distro which has the hdfs scheme check removed.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Altered the HadoopRecoverableWriter contructor body to not include the scheme check for HDFS.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCheck tests in LocalFlinkMiniClusterITCase whether they also apply to the MiniCluster and port if necessary. Afterwards remove LocalFlinkMiniClusterITCase.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n`LocalFlinkMiniClusterITCase` contains only `testLocalFlinkMiniClusterWithMultipleTaskManagers`. We don't cover multi TMs case in `MiniClusterITCase`. Thus add it. For implementation, simply test positive cases that a job with `numOfTMs * slotPerTM` can run with corresponding TMs and slots. negative cases test manually.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n`MiniClusterITCase#runJobWithSingleRpcService` and `MiniClusterITCase#runJobWithMultipleRpcServices` are now covered multi TMs case.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nLZ4 is a popular lightweight compression, which has better performance than Snappy in many cases, and also [recommended by RocksDB](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/Compression#configuration).\r\n\r\nBased on this, I introduce LZ4 except for now existing snappy compression for keyed state in full checkpoint and savepoints.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Introduce new `CompressionType` interface and move `StreamCompressionDecorator` related classes to `flink-core` module.\r\n  - Introduce new enum `CompressionTypes` class and new `LZ4StreamCompressionDecorator` class in `flink-runtime` module.\r\n  - Bump `KeyedBackendSerializationProxy` to a newer version for newer compression type.\r\n  - Migrated existing tests to use LZ4 compression.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n  - Extended unit tests `SerializationProxiesTest` and `StateSnapshotCompressionTest` for newely added compression type.\r\n  - Migrate `EventTimeWindowCheckpointingITCase` and `RescalingITCase` IT cases to use LZ4 compression.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): yes, add lz4-java dependency.\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: yes\r\n  - The serializers: no, but changed the `KeyedBackendSerializationProxy`\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no, should not affect topology task performance.\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? yes\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](http://flink.apache.org/contribute-code.html#best-practices).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](http://flink.apache.org/contribute-code.html#best-practices).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-16T14:39:00Z","updated_at":"2025-01-17T03:37:31Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":8006043121,"node_id":"LA_kwDOATokT88AAAAB3TKF8Q","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"D93F0B","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/7508/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/7508/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/7508/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/3ed3da1606d2ad42248020b00c2078984e9290e2","head":{"label":"Fokko:fd-add-example","ref":"fd-add-example","sha":"3ed3da1606d2ad42248020b00c2078984e9290e2","user":{"login":"Fokko","id":1134248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko","html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":77462009,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NzQ2MjAwOQ==","name":"flink","full_name":"Fokko/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Fokko","id":1134248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko","html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko/flink","description":"Mirror

To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](http://flink.apache.org/contribute-code.html#best-practices).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-16T14:11:54Z","updated_at":"2019-03-18T19:53:50Z","closed_at":"2019-01-17T12:44:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"26284181280431aac400f33714c02ff93fefbc97","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"aljoscha","id":68551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha","html_url":"https://github.com/aljoscha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aljoscha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1274303759,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjc0MzAzNzU5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Formats","name":"component=Formats","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/7506/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/7506/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/7506/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/8a18c4d4f5b2f7baf6e67ef97b109208d9c3bb48","head":{"label":"Fokko:FLINK-11347","ref":"FLINK-11347","sha":"8a18c4d4f5b2f7baf6e67ef97b109208d9c3bb48","user":{"login":"Fokko","id":1134248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko","html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":77462009,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NzQ2MjAwOQ==","name":"flink","full_name":"Fokko/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Fokko","id":1134248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko","html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko/flink","description":"Mirror

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nPrior to this PR, the `TypeSerializerSnapshotMigrationTestBase` was hardcoded to only test restoring from serializer snapshots generated in Flink 1.6.x.\r\n\r\nThe main goal of this PR is to:\r\n- Make the test base version-aware so that multiple serializer snapshots can be tested\r\n- Extend all existing subclasses to test migrating from a 1.7.x snapshot (test snapshots are generated and added to this PR)\r\n- There are some other minor changes to the test base, to better match the actual usage / API contracts of the `TypeSerializerSnapshot` abstraction.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- 8303eec: Move `MigrationVersion` class to flink-core, since it'll be used by `TypeSerializerSnapshotMigrationTestBase`.\r\n- f5b587a: Makes `TypeSerializerSnapshotMigrationTestBase` version-aware. Test specifications can now define the version that the target test snapshot was taken in.\r\n- a13ae99 to 2196635: Some minor changes to the test base to better match usage & API contracts of the `TypeSerializerSnapshot` abstraction.\r\n- 3ba6a5e: Adds a utility `TestSpecifications` class that would help with de-duplicating code when specifying test specifications for multiple versions.\r\n- c5d20b7 to 200edc7: Adding `MigrationVersion.1.7` to the parameters of all existing `TypeSerializerSnapshotMigrationTestBase` subclasses, as well as generating the required test snapshot / data files for them.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis is a refactoring of tests.\r\nAll subclasses of `TypeSerializerSnapshotMigrationTestBase` should be passing still.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? not

I95c3cc9707d405aa0c20cc466d477ca68f494800\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](http://flink.apache.org/contribute-code.html#best-practices).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\ndisplay all execution attempts on web\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - display all execution attempts on web\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers:  no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive):  no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?  no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

Task#run set task state as FINISHED\r\n2. Test case get the FINISHED future, call taskExecutor#shutdown, so the MemoryManager shutdown.\r\n3. In `finally` block of Task#run, call MemoryManager#releaseAll(owner)\r\n4. cause `IllegalStateException`\r\n\r\nHere, I find that after MemoryManager#shutdown, `allocatedSegments` and `memoryPool` are released properly. Thus a following #releaseAll can be safely omitted and an `IllegalStateException` is no-need.\r\n\r\n**UPDATE** basically it is an issue about execute order, I add a follow-up commit to ensure that the TaskExecutor shutdown after Task exit. We can revert the first commit but as pointed out above, maybe it is a better choice to omit a `#releaseAll` following `#shutdown` instead of causing a fatal error.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nOmit actions in memory manager after shutdown instead of throwing IllegalStateException\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *TaskExecutorTest*.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](http://flink.apache.org/contribute-code.html#best-practices).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](http://flink.apache.org/contribute-code.html#best-practices).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-15T23:02:11Z","updated_at":"2019-10-04T14:59:18Z","closed_at":"2019-10-04T14:59:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"059c74f24810eea23860a68c1562d4f530e45ceb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272994679,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0Njc5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=BuildSystem","name":"component=BuildSystem","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/7499/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/7499/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/7499/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/f364fe93859c0b3583d2dbb7582a01d05030e057","head":{"label":"Fokko:fd-bump-commons-configuration","ref":"fd-bump-commons-configuration","sha":"f364fe93859c0b3583d2dbb7582a01d05030e057","user":{"login":"Fokko","id":1134248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko","html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":77462009,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NzQ2MjAwOQ==","name":"flink","full_name":"Fokko/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Fokko","id":1134248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko","html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko/flink","description":"Mirror

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](http://flink.apache.org/contribute-code.html#best-practices).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-15T22:58:03Z","updated_at":"2019-10-04T14:49:04Z","closed_at":"2019-10-04T14:49:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"229e2b344e6ea2384715d76cc62b965178dbbd4a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272994679,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0Njc5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=BuildSystem","name":"component=BuildSystem","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/7498/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/7498/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/7498/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/fad565c0c57ce0ef4049cea5d6909d9952b4cb77","head":{"label":"Fokko:fd-bump-exec-maven-plugin","ref":"fd-bump-exec-maven-plugin","sha":"fad565c0c57ce0ef4049cea5d6909d9952b4cb77","user":{"login":"Fokko","id":1134248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko","html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":77462009,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NzQ2MjAwOQ==","name":"flink","full_name":"Fokko/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Fokko","id":1134248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko","html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko/flink","description":"Mirror

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](http://flink.apache.org/contribute-code.html#best-practices).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-15T22:54:01Z","updated_at":"2019-10-04T14:54:14Z","closed_at":"2019-10-04T14:54:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5e19b3ec20bd0dcc4b668778b92b2bc9eec80c27","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272994679,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0Njc5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=BuildSystem","name":"component=BuildSystem","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/7497/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/7497/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/7497/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/6cde30c1a510dd165f0ae185df024ae15bc78daa","head":{"label":"Fokko:fd-bump-maven-enforcer-plugin","ref":"fd-bump-maven-enforcer-plugin","sha":"6cde30c1a510dd165f0ae185df024ae15bc78daa","user":{"login":"Fokko","id":1134248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko","html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":77462009,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NzQ2MjAwOQ==","name":"flink","full_name":"Fokko/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Fokko","id":1134248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko","html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko/flink","description":"Mirror

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR migrates the `KryoSerializerConfigSnapshot` to use the new `TypeSerializerSnapshot` API. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - d69528004b - Adds an `OptionalMap`, a data structure, that support `null` values and `null` keys (but named uniquely).  This is needed to remove the previously used `DummyUnloadableClass` and `DummyUnloadableSerializer` that were used to flag that a class/serializer were not successfully loaded. With this map we can simply check for their existence.\r\n  - e476640c41 - Kryo is the first serializer that actually supports reconfiguration with the new API, so some tests needed to be adjusted. \r\n - cb058653c2 -  Completes the migration of the KryoSerializer to the new abstraction, by adding and using the new `KryoSerializerSnapshot`.\r\n\r\nThe following commits are migrating the serializers that are using `KryoSerializer` either directly, or using `Kryo` directly:\r\n- 1f7d4c9996 - Migrate the TrySerializer\r\n- a75160b3dc - Migrate the ValueSerializer\r\n- de7f64241d - Migrate the WritableSerializer\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- Added `XSnapshotMigrationTest` along with some test cases, for each migrated serializer.\r\n  \r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (**yes** / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (**yes** / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / **docs** / JavaDocs / not documented)","created_at":"2019-01-15T15:32:23Z","updated_at":"2019-03-18T19:53:31Z","closed_at":"2019-02-22T07:46:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9fe3d0bcc3702275eae4f2d145c3e37f10463ea8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273183016,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMTgzMDE2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=API/TypeSerializationSystem","name":"component=API/TypeSerializationSystem","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/7496/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/7496/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/7496/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/33df28dd24a10a6a9c073748de4a4385e7dfc326","head":{"label":"igalshilman:kryo-snapshot","ref":"kryo-snapshot","sha":"33df28dd24a10a6a9c073748de4a4385e7dfc326","user":{"login":"igalshilman","id":546103,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NjEwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/546103?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/igalshilman","html_url":"https://github.com/igalshilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igalshilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igalshilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igalshilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igalshilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igalshilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igalshilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igalshilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igalshilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igalshilman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":134559899,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzQ1NTk4OTk=","name":"flink","full_name":"igalshilman/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"igalshilman","id":546103,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NjEwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/546103?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/igalshilman","html_url":"https://github.com/igalshilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igalshilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igalshilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igalshilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igalshilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igalshilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igalshilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igalshilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igalshilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igalshilman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/igalshilman/flink","description":"Mirror

To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](http://flink.apache.org/contribute-code.html#best-practices).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*StreamingFunctionUtils.restoreFunctionState(context, getOperatorStateBackend(),userFunction)，so that the code formats of restoreFunctionState() and snapshotFunctionState() are consistent.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *restoreFunctionState() add parameter getOperatorStateBackend()*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(org.apache.flink.test.checkpointing.StateCheckpointedITCase)*.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-15T03:19:41Z","updated_at":"2019-01-16T07:00:46Z","closed_at":"2019-01-16T07:00:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ef662608339595bedb178dd83acecf17b63eb25d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/7490/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/7490/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/7490/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/84247989908cd90c9c7cd46e58f40bcc604f80f4","head":{"label":"intsmaze:master","ref":"master","sha":"84247989908cd90c9c7cd46e58f40bcc604f80f4","user":{"login":"intsmaze","id":29833082,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODMzMDgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29833082?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/intsmaze","html_url":"https://github.com/intsmaze","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/intsmaze/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/intsmaze/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/intsmaze/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/intsmaze/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/intsmaze/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/intsmaze/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/intsmaze/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/intsmaze/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/intsmaze/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"1325599153b162fc85679589cab0c2691bf398f1","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":20587599,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDU4NzU5OQ==","name":"flink","full_name":"apache/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink","description":"Apache

To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-11321] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](http://flink.apache.org/contribute-code.html#best-practices).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not

clock is missing in the docstring.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](http://flink.apache.org/contribute-code.html#best-practices).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-14T13:54:41Z","updated_at":"2019-01-15T10:20:10Z","closed_at":"2019-01-15T09:19:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fa3f8f528bcf2ccb8e8d60300975624895f2cca8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/7484/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/7484/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/7484/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/32144d46fcb7580156e544114ee56925adef331f","head":{"label":"Fokko:patch-1","ref":"patch-1","sha":"32144d46fcb7580156e544114ee56925adef331f","user":{"login":"Fokko","id":1134248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko","html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":77462009,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NzQ2MjAwOQ==","name":"flink","full_name":"Fokko/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Fokko","id":1134248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko","html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko/flink","description":"Mirror

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis pull request convert predicates to IN or NOT_IN for `Project`. In [FLINK-10474](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-10474), we force translate IN into a predicate to avoid translating to a JOIN. In addition, we add a Rule to convert the predicates back to IN so that we can generate code using a HashSet for the IN.\r\n\r\nHowever, [FLINK-10474](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-10474) only takes Filter into consideration. It would be great to also convert predicates in Project to IN. It not only will improve the performance for the Project, but also will avoid the problem raised in [FLINK-11308](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-11308), as all predicates will be converted into one IN expression.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Support convert predicates to IN or NOT IN for `Project` in `ConvertToNotInOrInRule`. Note: We don't need to convert predicates for `Calc` since there is no Calc during  `optimizeNormalizeLogicalPlan`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - Added tests in `CalcTest`\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes.

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](http://flink.apache.org/contribute-code.html#best-practices).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR fix typo in classloading doc\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nRemove redundant line.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts(all no):\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive):

Idb561da3982de07e77a05ffef9ad227094f527b0\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](http://flink.apache.org/contribute-code.html#best-practices).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - rename configuration options of queryable-state in QueryableStateOptions from `query.x` to `queryable-state.x`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency):  no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no \r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper:no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-13T02:26:34Z","updated_at":"2019-03-18T19:52:58Z","closed_at":"2019-01-16T14:06:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b824637709f3b821af08d14f0460e6b17c315c78","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273025819,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMDI1ODE5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Configuration","name":"component=Runtime/Configuration","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273392122,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMzkyMTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/QueryableState","name":"component=Runtime/QueryableState","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/7474/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/7474/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/7474/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/22b67b2effd626775fe91480a3bb40bb076d2ff4","head":{"label":"eaglewatcherwb:flink-11295","ref":"flink-11295","sha":"22b67b2effd626775fe91480a3bb40bb076d2ff4","user":{"login":"eaglewatcherwb","id":42056379,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMDU2Mzc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42056379?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb","html_url":"https://github.com/eaglewatcherwb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":163267123,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjMyNjcxMjM=","name":"flink","full_name":"eaglewatcherwb/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"eaglewatcherwb","id":42056379,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMDU2Mzc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42056379?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb","html_url":"https://github.com/eaglewatcherwb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/eaglewatcherwb/flink","description":"Apache

I052158e3b3f23f288c1270c43f19bb7441e250d1\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](http://flink.apache.org/contribute-code.html#best-practices).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-13T02:12:58Z","updated_at":"2019-03-18T19:52:55Z","closed_at":"2019-01-13T02:13:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1dd522747b6216cf2184d0a71eb07982a4c54bc7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273025819,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMDI1ODE5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Configuration","name":"component=Runtime/Configuration","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273392122,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMzkyMTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/QueryableState","name":"component=Runtime/QueryableState","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/7473/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/7473/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/7473/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/8684c6fc8892697c866714b5f2010fefa874cf5c","head":{"label":"eaglewatcherwb:upstream","ref":"upstream","sha":"8684c6fc8892697c866714b5f2010fefa874cf5c","user":{"login":"eaglewatcherwb","id":42056379,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMDU2Mzc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42056379?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb","html_url":"https://github.com/eaglewatcherwb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":163267123,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjMyNjcxMjM=","name":"flink","full_name":"eaglewatcherwb/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"eaglewatcherwb","id":42056379,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMDU2Mzc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42056379?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb","html_url":"https://github.com/eaglewatcherwb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/eaglewatcherwb/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](http://flink.apache.org/contribute-code.html#best-practices).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-11T15:48:53Z","updated_at":"2019-01-12T18:19:04Z","closed_at":"2019-01-12T18:19:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fddfe8fb808e8051afd17c2103a35cc0eda0cb4a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/7472/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/7472/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/7472/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/0803b4b4cdb46ef3174592e5743fac5189af1442","head":{"label":"caosuwenwu:master","ref":"master","sha":"0803b4b4cdb46ef3174592e5743fac5189af1442","user":{"login":"caosuwenwu","id":31889672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODg5Njcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31889672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caosuwenwu","html_url":"https://github.com/caosuwenwu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caosuwenwu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caosuwenwu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caosuwenwu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caosuwenwu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caosuwenwu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caosuwenwu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caosuwenwu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caosuwenwu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caosuwenwu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":163079635,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjMwNzk2MzU=","name":"flink","full_name":"caosuwenwu/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"caosuwenwu","id":31889672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODg5Njcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31889672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caosuwenwu","html_url":"https://github.com/caosuwenwu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caosuwenwu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caosuwenwu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caosuwenwu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caosuwenwu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caosuwenwu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caosuwenwu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caosuwenwu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caosuwenwu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caosuwenwu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/caosuwenwu/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](http://flink.apache.org/contribute-code.html#best-practices).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*invoke(Object)  is deprecated, Use  invoke(Object, Context) instead of it in the document *\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *invoke(Object)  is deprecated,Use invoke(Object, Context)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](http://flink.apache.org/contribute-code.html#best-practices).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR correct the usage of LOG.error\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Correct the usage of LOG.error\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts(all no):\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-11T14:17:12Z","updated_at":"2020-06-11T08:40:38Z","closed_at":"2019-01-12T10:48:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a243c3646d123ba6c8ecdb68353ad027ff87de4c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/7469/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/7469/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/7469/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/d34f9ecfbbaceec7f0c41ef4df39e3225a17c3bc","head":{"label":"KarmaGYZ:typo-logging","ref":"typo-logging","sha":"d34f9ecfbbaceec7f0c41ef4df39e3225a17c3bc","user":{"login":"KarmaGYZ","id":8684799,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2ODQ3OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8684799?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ","html_url":"https://github.com/KarmaGYZ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":159165742,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTkxNjU3NDI=","name":"flink","full_name":"KarmaGYZ/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"KarmaGYZ","id":8684799,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2ODQ3OTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8684799?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ","html_url":"https://github.com/KarmaGYZ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KarmaGYZ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/KarmaGYZ/flink","description":"Apache

all,\r\n\r\nDerby has two CVE's:\r\nhttps://ossindex.sonatype.org/vuln/b01781a6-31db-4dbc-b091-d683aaeb98e6\r\nhttps://ossindex.sonatype.org/vuln/bbe6594a-c255-41a7-a397-d762d1aa8b00\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-11306\r\n\r\nAlthough it is only a test dependency, updating would be nice.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](http://flink.apache.org/contribute-code.html#best-practices).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-11T09:12:21Z","updated_at":"2019-03-18T19:52:51Z","closed_at":"2019-01-11T12:11:47Z","merged_at":"2019-01-11T12:11:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"205f9064897bfcf5f8988d38deb5a407f9a7cae2","assignee":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272994679,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0Njc5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=BuildSystem","name":"component=BuildSystem","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273024685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMDI0Njg1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=API/DataSet","name":"component=API/DataSet","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/7468/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/7468/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/7468/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/0fb41b0c7d8e98857c2a5cab402a9c0574fdad76","head":{"label":"Fokko:FLINK-11306","ref":"FLINK-11306","sha":"0fb41b0c7d8e98857c2a5cab402a9c0574fdad76","user":{"login":"Fokko","id":1134248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko","html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":77462009,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NzQ2MjAwOQ==","name":"flink","full_name":"Fokko/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Fokko","id":1134248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko","html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/received_events"

You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](http://flink.apache.org/contribute-code.html#best-practices).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Offset is Long type, the default value is null, and executing offset+=1 in Java 1.8.x will throw a NullPointerException*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *In the CounterSource example, add a default value of 0L for offset.*\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes.

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](http://flink.apache.org/contribute-code.html#best-practices).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nRename configuration options of  queryable-state from query.x to queryable-state.x\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  -  rename configuration options of  queryable-state in QueryableStateOptions from query.x to queryable-state.x\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`:  no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no \r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector:no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?  no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

documented)\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-11T03:08:51Z","updated_at":"2019-03-18T19:52:46Z","closed_at":"2019-01-13T02:20:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3ff7f143bf07b0106cf99bdf6a37b0e2cda5f774","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273025819,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMDI1ODE5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Configuration","name":"component=Runtime/Configuration","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273392122,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMzkyMTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/QueryableState","name":"component=Runtime/QueryableState","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/7461/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/7461/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/7461/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/e786b31fac18d5dc79fcfc08ce2f6aea6021e96b","head":{"label":"eaglewatcherwb:flink-11295","ref":"flink-11295","sha":"e786b31fac18d5dc79fcfc08ce2f6aea6021e96b","user":{"login":"eaglewatcherwb","id":42056379,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMDU2Mzc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42056379?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb","html_url":"https://github.com/eaglewatcherwb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":163267123,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjMyNjcxMjM=","name":"flink","full_name":"eaglewatcherwb/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"eaglewatcherwb","id":42056379,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMDU2Mzc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42056379?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb","html_url":"https://github.com/eaglewatcherwb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/eaglewatcherwb/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\nThis changes the S3AccessHelper API to take a file instead of an input\r\nstream.\r\n\r\nThis allows s3 client to properly reset a file instead of an iUse file\r\nover stream for writes.\r\n\r\nThis fixes an issue where the underlying s3 implementation has an\r\nintermittent failure, tries to reset the stream, fails to do so, and\r\nresults in hung requests with delayed errors.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Improves the ability to handle intermittent errors when using the StreamingFileSink against s3 filesystem\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nCurrently, because this only happens with intermittent s3 issues, it is very difficult to reproduce, however, it does seem to fix the problem for multiple people, see the JIRA issue for details\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR adds separate fat-jar modules for the twitter and state-machine examples so that we can properly handle licenses for them. These jars have been bundling dependencies without any license files, requiring us to handle these dependencies in the flink-dist NOTICE-binary manually.\r\n\r\nThese modules work similar to the `flink-sql-connector` modules in that they do not contain any code themselves; they are purely used for assembling a jar with proper licensing. These jars are not deployed to maven, and only included in flink-dist.\r\n\r\nAdditionally this PR fixes an issue where transformers defined child-modules would disabled the NOTICE file transformer.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* add new `flink-examples-build-helper` module\r\n* add sub modules for each example\r\n* add licensing to new modules\r\n* move shade-plugin configuration for jar assembly from flink-examples-streaming to respective module\r\n* update flink-dist assembly to account for new modules\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nManually verified. Ran both examples on a local cluster and inspected jar contents.\r\n\r\nThe state-machine jar no longer includes classes from flink-core that were accidentally pulled in.\r\nThe Twitter jar no longer bundles chill that was accidentally pulled

by default.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* update `create_binary_release.sh` to reflect profile activation changes\r\n* remove hadoop-free WordCount E2E test, since this is now the default\r\n* update YARN IT cases to use `--yarnship` option for hadoop jar\r\n  * These tests directly use flink-dist, similar to e2e tests. They currently rely on hadoop being bundled by before, so I had to change them to explicitly ship hadoop. This required an additional dependency on `flink-shaded-hadoop2-uber` for `flink-yarn-tests`.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThe release scripts have to be verified manually.\r\n\r\nThe Yarn tests check that copying the `shaded-hadoop2-uber` jar is sufficient for running hadoop-dependent jobs.\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-10T12:02:50Z","updated_at":"2019-03-18T19:52:27Z","closed_at":"2019-01-29T14:44:57Z","merged_at":"2019-01-29T14:44:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"81acd0a490f3ac40cbb2736189796138ac109dd0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272994679,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0Njc5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=BuildSystem","name":"component=BuildSystem","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/7451/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/7451/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/7451/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/8a60f0c334ff6846f024be66787fbc3fc1f42438","head":{"label":"zentol:11270","ref":"11270","sha":"8a60f0c334ff6846f024be66787fbc3fc1f42438","user":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":20647396,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0NzM5Ng==","name":"flink","full_name":"zentol/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zentol/flink","description":"Mirror

want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](http://flink.apache.org/contribute-code.html#best-practices).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis pull request bumps Netty to a newer version (4.1.32) for the following improvements/changes done since 4.1.24:\r\n- big improvements (performance, feature set) for using openSSL based SSL engine (useful for FLINK-9816)\r\n- allow multiple shaded versions of the same netty artifact (as long as the shaded prefix is different)\r\n- Ensure ByteToMessageDecoder.Cumulator implementations always release\r\n- Don't re-arm timerfd each epoll_wait\r\n- Use a non-volatile read for ensureAccessible() whenever possible to reduce overhead and allow better inlining.\r\n- Do not fail on runtime when an older version of Log4J2 is on the classpath\r\n- Fix leak and corruption bugs in CompositeByteBuf\r\n- Add support for TLSv1.3\r\n- Harden ref-counting concurrency semantics\r\n- bug fixes\r\n- Java 9-12 related fixes\r\n\r\nPlease note that this PR is based on https://github.com/apache/flink-shaded/pull/55 and temporarily fetches from that repository to run the tests with the upgraded netty version.\r\nBeware NOT to merge the according commit marked as `[DO-NOT-MERGE]` - and then only merge it once a new version of `flink-shaded` has been released that contains the new Netty version.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- bump netty dependency\r\n- update `AbstractByteBufTest` to the updated code\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR adds separate fat-jar modules for the twitter and state-machine examples so that we can properly handle licenses for them. These jars have been bundling dependencies without any license files, requiring us to handle these dependencies in the flink-dist NOTICE-binary manually.\r\n\r\nThese modules work similar to the `flink-sql-connector` modules in that they do not contain any code themselves; they are purely used for assembling a jar with proper licensing. These jars are not deployed to maven, and only included in flink-dist.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* add new `flink-examples-build-helper` module\r\n* add sub modules for each example\r\n* add licensing to new modules\r\n* move shade-plugin configuration for jar assembly from flink-examples-streaming to respective module\r\n* update flink-dist assembly to account for new modules\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nManually verified. Ran both examples on a local cluster and inspected jar contents.\r\n\r\nThe state-machine jar no longer includes classes from flink-core that were accidentally pulled in.\r\nThe Twitter jar no longer bundles chill that was accidentally pulled in.","created_at":"2019-01-09T15:28:13Z","updated_at":"2019-03-18T19:52:15Z","closed_at":"2019-01-10T13:47:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"71f1e4f8ee89e4a388ba5049c83808c49e1ad352","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272994679,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0Njc5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=BuildSystem","name":"component=BuildSystem","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1272995158,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk1MTU4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Examples","name":"component=Examples","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/7444/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/7444/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/7444/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/f79f29174b86f335d02c910b36f5e3e6eaaeeb46","head":{"label":"zentol:11288","ref":"11288","sha":"f79f29174b86f335d02c910b36f5e3e6eaaeeb46","user":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":20647396,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0NzM5Ng==","name":"flink","full_name":"zentol/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zentol/flink","description":"Mirror

In some cases it is seemingly incorrect as it cites a binary dependency on `jersey`, which I believe to not apply to the client.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces sql functions that allow extracting time attributes from `MATCH_RECOGNIZE` clause. It introduces `MATCH_ROWTIME` and `MATCH_PROCTIME` functions. It also switches to newly introduced in cep library `PatternProcessFunction`. This function provides more fine grained access to contextual information and provides rich interface as well.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n- 3483ef0 - static methods `generateIterativeCondition` and `generateOneRowPerMatchExpression` shared a lot parameters and always worked on top of `MatchCodeGenerator` therefore I converted them into instance methods\r\n- 9155542 - switches from `PatternSelectFunction` to `PatternProcessFunction`\r\n- c5cef52e - adds support for `MATCH_ROWTIME` and `MATCH_PROCTIME`\r\n- b64cea1 - describes the functions in documentation\r\n- 83e5f77 - formats match_recognize.md to keep line length under 100 characters. There are just a few places where this limit is not restricted as that would break the markdown rendering (long markdown links or html tags)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nIt adds tests in `MatchRecognizeITCase`\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): **no**\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: **no**\r\n  - The serializers: **no**\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): **no**\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: **no**\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: **no**\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? **yes**\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

the format to make it the same as the example above。\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*It is reasonable for merging `StreamRecordWriter` into `RecordWriter`, because the `flushAlways` semantic special for streaming job is already reflected in `RecordWriter`.*\r\n\r\n*To do so we can unify the implementation for both streaming and bath job, and it makes easy for introducing `BroadcastRecordWriter` for handling broadcast mode specially in another PR.*\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Delete `StreamRecordWriter` class*\r\n  - *Migrate flusher related processes into `RecordWriter*\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n

To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](http://flink.apache.org/contribute-code.html#best-practices).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nadd support for dynamic proxy classes resolution in job defination\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Add custom implementation of `resolveProxyClass` in `InstantiationUtil`, which could use the costumed class loader\r\n  - Add new unit test to verify the fix\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - Without this fix, a java.lang.ClassNotFoundException will be thrown when running the added unit test.\r\n  - With this fix, the added unit test could run properly\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency):  no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers:  no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-09T03:25:44Z","updated_at":"2019-03-18T19:51:58Z","closed_at":"2019-01-29T13:04:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4fff998d1ee0f80e98bc7d14d3f4f3ec6a44562e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272993074,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTkzMDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=%3Cnone%3E","name":"component=<none>","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/7436/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/7436/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/7436/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/487b387105bcd68cbb2fd46c96ee1c5297441408","head":{"label":"eaglewatcherwb:flink-11071","ref":"flink-11071","sha":"487b387105bcd68cbb2fd46c96ee1c5297441408","user":{"login":"eaglewatcherwb","id":42056379,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMDU2Mzc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42056379?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb","html_url":"https://github.com/eaglewatcherwb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":163267123,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjMyNjcxMjM=","name":"flink","full_name":"eaglewatcherwb/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"eaglewatcherwb","id":42056379,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMDU2Mzc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42056379?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb","html_url":"https://github.com/eaglewatcherwb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/eaglewatcherwb/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n`RocksDBListState` was using the serializer provided by the state descriptor, which is incorrect because that serializer have not been checked for compatibility or reconfigured if required.\r\n\r\nInstead, it should be using the actual resulting registered serializer in the backend's state meta infos, which is guaranteed to have been checked for compatibility.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- 9317611: the main change as described in description\r\n- 6b7401c: Validates the fix by activating a previously ignored test in `StateBackendMigrationTestBase`. That test wasn't passing due to FLINK-11073 and FLINK-11287 (which this PR fixes).\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThe previously ignored test `StateBackendMigrationTestBase.testKeyedListStateSerializerReconfiguration` should now pass, as FLINK-11287 is partially the reason of why it wasn't passing before.\r\n\r\nThat test verifies that `RocksDBListState` is indeed using the correct, compatibility-checked / reconfigured serializer.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis commit removes container requests after containers have been allocated. This prevents that\r\nwe will request more and more containers from Yarn in case of a recovery.\r\n\r\nSince we cannot rely on the reported container `Resource`, we remove the container request by\r\nusing the requested `Resource`. This is due Yarn's `DefaultResourceCalculator` which neglects the\r\nnumber of vCores when allocating containers. At the moment, the requested `Resource` is always the same (`ResourceProfiles` are not yet supported).\r\n\r\ncc @suez1224.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Remove container requests after containers have been allocated\r\n- Use a fixed `Resource` and `Priority` for container requests --> this allows to retrieve requests from the `AMRMClient`\r\n- Keep internal state and `AMRMClientImpl's` state in sync\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- Adopted `YarnResourceManagerTest#testOnContainerCompleted` and `YarnFlinkResourceManagerTest#testYarnFlinkResourceManagerJobManagerLostLeadership`\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the failing test in master:\r\n`StateBackendMigrationTestBase.testStateBackendRestoreSucceedsIfNewKeySerializerRequiresReconfiguration`.\r\n\r\nThe test reconfigures the key serializer and verifies that the reconfigured version is used instead of the original one. The test fails because when writing keys in the `RocksDBKeyedStateBackend`, the `RocksDBSerializedCompositeKeyBuilder` was using the invalid, non-reconfigured key serializer.\r\n\r\nThe culprit is that the composite key builder is created in the constructor of the `RocksDBKeyedStateBackend`. The creation of the builder requires providing a key serializer.\r\n\r\nThis is problematic, because the key serializer may be reconfigured during the restore phase, therefore invalidating the key serializer used by the composite key builder.\r\n\r\nThis commit resolves this by lazily creating the composite key builder only after the restore phase, which would be the point-in-time when we are certain the key serializer will no longer be changed and is final.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThe previously failing test

serialized key.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThe previously failing test `StateBackendMigrationTestBase.testStateBackendRestoreSucceedsIfNewKeySerializerRequiresReconfiguration` should now pass.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): **yes**\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? not applicable\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-08T08:00:37Z","updated_at":"2019-03-18T19:51:42Z","closed_at":"2019-01-08T10:36:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9828f7dd9cbd6122dd06d0b1fe18888b2dbac618","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273319732,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMzE5NzMy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/StateBackends","name":"component=Runtime/StateBackends","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/7428/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/7428/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/7428/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/49bfdd81562c85322420b67b916bbde55d12d282","head":{"label":"tzulitai:FLINK-11280","ref":"FLINK-11280","sha":"49bfdd81562c85322420b67b916bbde55d12d282","user":{"login":"tzulitai","id":5284370,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyODQzNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5284370?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai","html_url":"https://github.com/tzulitai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":55886834,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NTg4NjgzNA==","name":"flink","full_name":"tzulitai/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tzulitai","id":5284370,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyODQzNzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5284370?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai","html_url":"https://github.com/tzulitai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzulitai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tzulitai/flink","description":"Mirror

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR cancels container requests when cancelling pending slot allocations for `YarnResourceManager`. `MesosResourceManager` could be updated by a separate PR.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n  - Add `cancelResourceRequest` to `SlotManager`. When cancelling a pending slot request which no container had been assigned to and has a pending slot, cancel the container request via `cancelResourceRequest`.\r\n  - Add `cancelResourceRequest` to `ResourceAction`.\r\n  - Add `cancelWorkerRequest` to `ResourceManager`.\r\n  - Implement `cancelWorkerRequest` for `YarnResourceManager` to remove container requests. Using a lock to ensure that the retrieval and removal of pending requests are an atomic operation.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests:\r\n  - Add `testCancelResourceRequest` to `SlotManagerTest`.\r\n  - Add `testCancelWorkerRequest` to `YarnResourceManagerTest`\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (***yes***)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR is a follow-up of #7329.\r\n\r\n#7329 introduced the new `COMPATIBLE_WITH_RECONFIGURED_SERIALIZER` option.\r\nOnce that was added, there are 2 places in Flink that needs to respect this new case:\r\n\r\n1. In state backends: when checking compatibility of the new serializer, if the compatibility check signals that a new reconfigured serializer instance is returned, then that said instance should be used instead of the original new serializer.\r\n2. In composite serializers that contain nested serializers: likewise, compatibility checks on nested serializers that returns new reconfigured instances of the nested serializer should be propagated further up in the final compatibility result of the parent composite serializer.\r\n\r\nThe first case is already handled in #7329. This PR deals with the second case.\r\n\r\nSince Flink has many composite serializers (e.g. `GenericArraySerializer`, `ListSerializer`, `MapSerializer`, etc.), we introduce a new base abstract class `CompositeTypeSerializerSnapshot` to encapsulate the logic of deriving the final compatibility result across multiple nested serializers.\r\n\r\nThe snapshot classes of all composite serializers that were already migrated to the new `TypeSerializerSnapshot` abstractions in 1.7 are also re-visited to deduplicate code by extending the new `CompositeTypeSerializerSnapshot` class.\r\n\r\nThe class-level Javadoc of `CompositeTypeSerializerSnapshot` contains more details on its serialization format and how it handles versioning for subclasses.\r\n\r\nWith this PR merged, Flink will then properly support implementing state serializers with immutable configuration / state.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- 9329a94: Introduces the new base class `CompositeTypeSerializerSnapshot` for all composite serializers' snapshot class.\r\n- 004103d to 8f2bb8b: Straightforward of deduplicating code in serializer snapshot classes of all composite serializers that were already migrated to the new `TypeSerializerSnapshot` abstractions in 1.7. They now extend `CompositeTypeSerializerSnapshot`.\r\n- 5f8cb30 to 9d33d3a: Replaces the original snapshot classes of `GenericArraySerializer` and `EitherSerializer` with new subclasses of `CompositeTypeSerializerSnapshot`. These two snapshot classes are handled a bit differently (i.e. introducing new classes) comparing to other snapshot classes, because the original `GenericArraySerializerConfigSnapshot` and `EitherSerializerSnapshot` implementations have more complicated versioning branches on the read path that does not allow us to change them to directly extend `CompositeTypeSerializerSnapshot`.\r\n- 4a2a77f: Rename the old `CompositeSerializerSnapshot` to `NestedSerializersSnapshotDelegate`, and mark it as intended for internal usage only. We now encourage users to use `CompositeTypeSerializerSnapshot` instead if they are implementing a composite serializer.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nNew tests: `CompositeTypeSerializerSnapshotTest`.\r\n\r\nExisting relevant tests: All subclasses of `TypeSerializerSnapshotMigrationTestBase`.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (**yes** / no) -
