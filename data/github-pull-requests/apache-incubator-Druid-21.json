missing task failure error message on Overlord. \r\n\r\nThe error message was missing since `TaskManagementResource#assignTask` API wasn't annotated with `@Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)`

The exception is not logged on the middle manager itself since it happens even before entering the `assignTask` function -- while mapping arg `Task` -> `MSQControllerTask`. \r\n\r\nResolution is to add `@Produces` annotation to `TaskManagementResource#assignTask`\r\n\r\nUpdated error message on Overlord:\r\n\r\n> org.apache.druid.java.util.common.RE: Failed to assign task[query-50594440-9720-451b-b5c1-76a3d3ff6ffe] to worker[localhost:8091].

https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/15380\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nCurrently when we submit a task to druid and number of currently active tasks has already reached

proper error message) instead of 500 ISE, when we submit a task and queueSize has reached. \r\n\r\nTested and attached the screenshot\r\n<img width=\"600\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-11-21 at 12 37 34 PM\"

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be!

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\nUpgrade MySql connector to 8.2.0 to fix security vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * Upgrade version\r\n * Replace deprecated classes with the new ones - https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connectors/en/connector-j-upgrading-to-8.0.html\r\n * The upgraded version of MySQL connector does not have the `parseURL` method in `com.mysql.jdbc.NonRegisteringDriver` previously used. Instead, we use the `com.mysql.cj.conf.ConnectionUrlParser` which only checks if the schema of the string matches the prescribed format. The test cases related to string parsing are hence removed.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things. Not all of these items apply to every PR.

worked.\r\n\r\nThe script then does a `split(':')` which for me produces `['hw.memsize', ' 68719476736\\nhw.memsize_usable', ' 68719476736\\n']`\r\n\r\nand the `[1]` index can not be parsed as a

Major changes\r\n\r\nCurrently, while reading results from realtime tasks, requests are sent on a segment level. This is slightly wasteful, as when contacting a data servers, it is possible to transfer results for all segments which it is hosting, instead of only one segment at a time. \r\n\r\nOne change this PR makes is to group the segments on the basis of servers. This reduces the number of queries to data servers made. Since we don't have access to the number of rows for realtime segments, the grouping is done with a fixed estimated number of rows for each realtime segment.\r\n\r\n If the segments have already been handed off, the earlier approach made was to fetch the segments from deep storage. \r\n\r\nAfter the above changes, a single worker processor thread might have to fetch all segments from deepstorage, missing an oppurtunity for parellelism, since each segment fetch from deepstorage, is a separate operation. This PR also edits the ChainedProcessorManager. The initial BaseLeafFrameProcessors return the list of segments which were handed off. The ProcessorManager then uses this information to create new list of frame processors, handle the newer handed off segments.\r\n\r\n- Optimize MSQ queries to realtime tasks, by grouping segments served by the same server together.\r\n- Modify BaseLeafFrameProcessors and ChainedProcessorManager to take handle handed of segments\r\n- Update DataServerResponseHandler to support backpressure and query timeout.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

sequence name of a streaming task is determined by hashing the following:\r\n- min message time\r\n- max message time\r\n- data schema\r\n- tuning config\r\n- start partition offsets\r\n\r\nThus even if a task fails and another task is created to ingest that data, it gets assigned the same offset and would thus use the same `sequence_name` for segment allocation.\r\n\r\nThis PR only adds a simple test to verify that the sequence name does not depend on the task ID.\r\nMore tests can be later added around the sequence name to verify the other fields that affect the sequence name.","created_at":"2023-11-20T03:16:46Z","updated_at":"2024-01-29T07:44:41Z","closed_at":"2023-11-21T04:47:32Z","merged_at":"2023-11-21T04:47:32Z","merge_commit_sha":"4ba3cf52215443e30b7033252321d0ee98118333","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":690563043,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTA1NjMwNDM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Streaming%20Ingestion","name":"Area

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code?

For example: -->\r\n\r\n Fixed the flaky test `testWiki` inside WikiParquetReaderTest class\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n#### Root Cause\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe test `testWiki` has been reported as flaky when run with the [NonDex](https://github.com/TestingResearchIllinois/NonDex) tool. The test failed because it is trying to compare two Json strings, but since the JSON library used here is internally using HashMap. The HashMap in Java is implemented in such a way that it does not store the order in which the keys and values are inserted. As a result, when the expected Json string(which is hard-coded) is compared with the actual one, it caused the failure.\r\n\r\n#### Fix\r\nThis test is fixed using the Jackson library which contains classes JsonNode and ObjectMapper. These are used to parse two JSON strings to tree models and then compare these trees node by node. So when we use this, the order of the elements in the JSON strings is ignored and only the content is checked.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How this has been tested?\r\nJava: openjdk version \"11.0.20.1\"\r\nMaven: Apache Maven 3.6.3\r\n\r\n1.

is a problem with Quantiles sketches and KLL Quantiles sketches. Queries using the histogram post-aggregator fail if:\r\n\r\n- the sketch contains at least one value, and\r\n- the values in the sketch are all equal, and\r\n- the splitPoints argument is not passed to the post-aggregator, and\r\n- the numBins argument is greater than 2 (or not specified, which leads to the default of 10 being used)\r\n\r\nIn that case, the query fails and returns this error:\r\n\r\n    {\r\n      \"error\": \"Unknown exception\",\r\n      \"errorClass\": \"org.apache.datasketches.common.SketchesArgumentException\",\r\n      \"host\": null,\r\n      \"errorCode\": \"legacyQueryException\",\r\n      \"persona\": \"OPERATOR\",\r\n      \"category\": \"RUNTIME_FAILURE\",\r\n      \"errorMessage\": \"Values must be unique, monotonically increasing and not NaN.\",\r\n      \"context\": {\r\n        \"host\": null,\r\n        \"errorClass\": \"org.apache.datasketches.common.SketchesArgumentException\",\r\n        \"legacyErrorCode\": \"Unknown exception\"\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis behaviour is undesirable, since the caller doesn't necessarily know in advance whether the sketch has values that are diverse enough. With this change, the post-aggregators return [N, 0, 0...] instead of crashing, where N is the number of values in the sketch, and the length of the list is equal to numBins. That is what they already returned for numBins = 2.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of a query that would fail:\r\n\r\n    {\"queryType\":\"timeseries\",\r\n     \"dataSource\": {\r\n       \"type\": \"inline\",\r\n       \"columnNames\": [\"foo\", \"bar\"],\r\n       \"rows\": [\r\n          [\"abc\", 42.0],\r\n          [\"def\", 42.0]\r\n       ]\r\n     },\r\n     \"intervals\":[\"0000/3000\"],\r\n     \"granularity\":\"all\",\r\n     \"aggregations\":[\r\n       {\"name\":\"the_sketch\", \"fieldName\":\"bar\", \"type\":\"quantilesDoublesSketch\"}],\r\n     \"postAggregations\":[\r\n       {\"name\":\"the_histogram\",\r\n        \"type\":\"quantilesDoublesSketchToHistogram\",\r\n        \"field\":{\"type\":\"fieldAccess\",\"fieldName\":\"the_sketch\"},\r\n        \"numBins\": 3}]}\r\n\r\nI believe this also fixes issue #10585.\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be!

If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\nI noticed this error when trying to get histograms from quantiles sketches. At first it seemed intermittent and random, as it would go away when I changed the query a bit, but eventually I realised that it depends on the underlying data. topN queries are particularly susceptible, as it's enough for one of the dimension values to have a sketch with a single value for the entire query to fail.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\nI'm checking for the case where `splitPoints` isn't explicitly specified, but the minimum and maximum values of the sketch are equal. In that case, I don't bother calling the `getPMF` method of the sketch, since the result is given. Instead, I just return an array where the first element is the number of values in the sketch.\r\n\r\nI considered changing the list of split points to something that `getPMF` would accept, e.g. setting `delta` to 1.0, or setting `max` to `Double.MAX_VALUE` and calculating `delta` from that. In the end, I thought that there is no obvious choice, and any way of coming up with artificial split points could cause problems depending on which values are in the sketch. (For example, if the minimum value is greater than 2^53, adding 1.0 becomes a no-op.)\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nFixed: Histogram post-aggregators for Quantiles and KLL sketches no longer fail if all values in the sketch are equal.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `DoublesSketchToHistogramPostAggregator`\r\n * `KllDoublesSketchToHistogramPostAggregator`\r\n * `KllFloatsSketchToHistogramPostAggregator`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews.

This is particularly important in the following scenarios:\r\n1. Concurrent replace and append to a datasource containing tombstones and data segments in the same time chunk (also, related coordinator duty: https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/15281)\r\n2. If a user drops a tombstone segment and there are other data segments appended to it, the data segments should still be available\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

This means they can be dropped or removed independently without affecting availability of other appended segments in the same co-partition space. Note that removing tombstones with 1 core partition (prior to this change) that contain appended segments in the partition space can make the appended segments unavailable.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `TombstoneShardSpec.java`\r\n * `IndexerSQLMetadataStorageCoordinatorTest.java`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n### Goal of the PR:\r\nThe findings apply to both identified tests:\r\n- The dimensions of `row` are converted to set from list internally.\r\n- The order of dimensions in `row` is being changed by internal executions.\r\n- When comparing the dimensions of `row` with an immutable list of dimensions, a flaky error can arise if the order of dimensions in `row` is changed unintentionally during transit.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n### Patch Description:\r\n- The fix involves comparing the dimensions of row with an `ImmutableSet`.\r\n- The dimensions of row are converted to a HashSet().\r\n- This change enables to perform the assertion on the presence of elements rather than the actual order.\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable?

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR. Remove this section if there is no corresponding issue.

If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n### Patch Description:\r\n- In order to eliminate the non-determinism introduced by `entrySet()`, we can sort `expectedSubTaskStateResponses` using the id.\r\n- In `response`, there is no guarantee that the order of elements will be maintained.\r\n- Thus, we introduce a sorting using `Id` and save it in an `actual` list.\r\n- In the assertion, we compare the two sorted entities to ensure that the expected elements are present and remove the emphasis on receiving elements in the correct order.\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\nI used a tool called [NonDex](https://github.com/TestingResearchIllinois/NonDex) to confirm the presence of flakiness.\r\n\r\n### Steps to verify using NonDex:\r\n1. Run `mvn -pl indexing-service edu.illinois:nondex-maven-plugin:2.1.1:nondex -Dtest=org.apache.druid.indexing.common.task.batch.parallel.ParallelIndexSupervisorTaskResourceTest#testAPIs`.\r\n2.

If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\n- The mentioned tests compare if the retrieved schema is similar to the default schema that is individually stored in the test files. \r\n- When the schema is being retrieved, the schema elements are not retrieved in order.\r\n- This is because the `jsonMapper` used to read the value from `inputFormat2` is instantiated on the `ObjectMapper` class. \r\n- The `ObjectMapper` class internally uses the `getDeclaredFields()` method to retrieve data and this does not guarantee the order in which data will be received.\r\n- This introduces a bit of non-determinism when we are comparing the values stored in `inputRow` with static data.\r\n- The flakiness was captured by the [NonDex](https://github.com/TestingResearchIllinois/NonDex) tool as well.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/krishnanand5/druid/blob/ad32f8458670339808a3136a9578a10a52b8394f/extensions-core/avro-extensions/src/test/java/org/apache/druid/data/input/AvroStreamInputRowParserTest.java#L304\r\n\r\n```\r\n[ERROR] Failures: \r\n[ERROR] org.apache.druid.data.input.AvroStreamInputFormatTest.testParseSchemaless\r\n[ERROR]   Run 1: AvroStreamInputFormatTest.testParseSchemaless:434 expected:<[nestedArrayVal, someOtherId, someIntArray, someFloat, someUnion, eventType, id, someFixed, someBytes, someEnum, someLong, someInt, timestamp]> but was:<[nestedArrayVal, someLong, someEnum, someFixed, someBytes, someInt, someIntArray, eventType, someUnion, someFloat, someOtherId, id, timestamp]>\r\n[ERROR]   Run 2: AvroStreamInputFormatTest.testParseSchemaless:434 expected:<[nestedArrayVal, someOtherId, someIntArray, someFloat, someUnion, eventType, id, someFixed, someBytes, someEnum, someLong, someInt, timestamp]> but was:<[nestedArrayVal, someUnion, someLong, eventType, someFloat, someInt, someBytes, someEnum, id, someIntArray, timestamp, someFixed, someOtherId]>\r\n[ERROR]   Run 3: AvroStreamInputFormatTest.testParseSchemaless:434 expected:<[nestedArrayVal, someOtherId, someIntArray, someFloat, someUnion, eventType, id, someFixed, someBytes, someEnum, someLong, someInt, timestamp]> but was:<[nestedArrayVal, someFixed, someFloat, someIntArray, id, someBytes, someInt, eventType, timestamp, someLong, someEnum, someOtherId, someUnion]>\r\n[ERROR]   Run 4: AvroStreamInputFormatTest.testParseSchemaless:434 expected:<[nestedArrayVal, someOtherId, someIntArray, someFloat, someUnion, eventType, id, someFixed, someBytes, someEnum, someLong, someInt, timestamp]> but was:<[nestedArrayVal, someUnion, someFixed, someInt, timestamp, someEnum, eventType, someLong, someIntArray, someFloat, id, someBytes, someOtherId]>\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] \r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code?

For example: -->\r\n\r\nCurrently in the realtime ingestion (Kafka/Kinesis) case, after publishing the segments, upon acknowledgement from the coordinator that the segments are already placed in some historicals, the peon would unannounce the segments (basically saying the segments are not in this peon anymore to the whole cluster) and drop the segments from cache and sink timeline in one shot. \r\n\r\nThe in transit queries from the brokers that still thinks the segments are in the peon can get a NullPointer exception when the peon is unsetting the hydrants in the sinks. \r\n\r\nThe fix would let the peon to wait for a configurable delay period before dropping segments, remove segments from cache etc after the peon unannounce the segments. \r\n\r\nThis delayed approach is similar to how the historicals handle segments moving out.\r\n\r\nSee the details of discussion in Apache slack channel [here](https://apachedruidworkspace.slack.com/archives/C0309C9L90D/p1699584076521929?thread_ts=1698263651.554789&cid=C0309C9L90D)\r\n\r\n#### Fixed the bug ...\r\n#### Renamed the class ...\r\n#### Added a forbidden-apis entry ...\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects.

Description\r\nCurrently, AbstractTask.cleanup is run twice when running a small index_parallel task with mmless ingestion because the ParallelIndexSupervisorTask statically creates a IndexTask and call .run() on it in its own .run() implementation.\r\n\r\nSince both ParallelIndexSupervisorTask and IndexTask both subclass AbstractTask, they both get .cleanup called in their .run implementation. Because of this, task reports get uploaded twice (once by the IndexTask and once by the ParallelIndexSupervisorTask). This is not technically a issue if using S3 deep storage since ParallelIndexSupervisorTask gets its task status from IndexTask and S3 just does a no-op overwrite of the report, but this seems weird and practice and causes issues in Azure deep storage since it doesn't support overwriting by default.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Fixed the bug ...\r\n#### Renamed the class ...\r\n#### Added a forbidden-apis entry ...\r\nWhen creating the IndexTask, set shouldCleanup to false. Cleanup is handled by the parent task.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nFix cleanup bug with index tasks and mmless ingestion.\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `IndexTask`\r\n * `ParallelIndexSupervisorTask`\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

bug where MSQ controller task would continue to hold the task slot even after cancel was issued. \r\nThis was due to a deadlock created on work launch. The main thread was waiting for tasks to spawn and the cancel thread was waiting for tasks to finish. \r\nThe fix was to instruct the `MSQWorkerTaskLauncher` thread to stop creating new tasks which would enable the main thread to unblock and release the slot. \r\n\r\nAlso short circuited the taskRetriable condition. Now the check is run in the `MSQWorkerTaskLauncher` thread as opposed to the main event thread loop. This will result in faster task failure in case the task is deemed to be non retriable. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2023-11-14T07:32:14Z","updated_at":"2024-01-29T07:45:19Z","closed_at":"2023-11-15T12:52:51Z","merged_at":"2023-11-15T12:52:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"a70a3d5d4896b803ef8bad1af77c194a2ab45abe","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"LakshSingla","id":30999375,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTk5Mzc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30999375?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LakshSingla","html_url":"https://github.com/LakshSingla","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LakshSingla/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LakshSingla/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LakshSingla/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LakshSingla/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LakshSingla/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LakshSingla/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LakshSingla/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LakshSingla/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LakshSingla/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":219582906,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODI5MDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Batch%20Ingestion","name":"Area

Description\r\n\r\nAlternative mentioned in #15350, which is simplified and only matches a single array element rather than being a full implementation of 'ARRAY_CONTAINS'. Decided to do this one when I realized that multi-value dimensions would be handled incorrectly with the other filter when using array type element matches.\r\n\r\nArray element indexes are already hiding inside of array type columns, this PR adds a native `arrayContainsElement` filter so we can actually use them to implement things like `ARRAY_CONTAINS` (in this PR) and `ARRAY_OVERLAP` (not in this PR).\r\n\r\nNo documentation currently added, will do that in a follow-up PR.\r\n\r\nAs expected, this is a giant perf improvement when using `ARRAY_CONTAINS` on array columns. For the query added in the benchmarks:\r\n```\r\nSELECT string1, long1 FROM foo WHERE ARRAY_CONTAINS(\"multi-string3\", 100) GROUP BY 1,2\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```\r\nBenchmark                        (query)  (rowsPerSegment)  (schema)  (vectorize)  Mode  Cnt     Score    Error  Units\r\nSqlExpressionBenchmark.querySql       38           5000000      auto        false  avgt    5  4839.508 ± 89.496  ms/op\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n```\r\nBenchmark                        (query)  (rowsPerSegment)  (schema)  (vectorize)  Mode  Cnt    Score   Error  Units\r\nSqlExpressionBenchmark.querySql       38           5000000      auto        false  avgt    5  133.610 ± 3.750  ms/op\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests

Description\r\n\r\n* support `groups`  windowing mode; which is a close relative of `ranges` (but not in the standard)\r\n* all windows with range expressions will be executed wit it `groups`\r\n* it will be 100% correct in case for both bounds its true that: `isCurrentRow() || isUnBounded()` \r\n   * this covers `OVER ( ORDER BY COL )`\r\n* for other cases it will have some chances of getting

`UNBOUNDED`.\r\nThis includes windows like:\r\n```\r\n(ORDER BY c)\r\n(ORDER BY c RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)\r\n(ORDER BY c RANGE BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND UNBOUNDED

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR. Remove this section if there is no corresponding issue. Don't reference the issue in the title of this pull-request. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are a committer, follow the PR action item checklist for committers:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/committer-instructions.md#pr-and-issue-action-item-checklist-for-committers. -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing. If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\nThrough this PR, I am proposing fix for one of the flaky tests I identified in \r\n`org.apache.druid.query.aggregation.histogram.ApproximateHistogramAggregatorTest.testFinalize`.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n- The flakiness observed in the test is because of the non-deterministic nature of order of elements in the `finalStringHumanReadable` during the assertion.\r\n- In order to address the issue, we can compare both the expected and actual values as JSON elements directly.\r\n- This helps in asserting that the intended key-value pairs are present.\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n**STEPS TO REPRODUCE THE ISSUE:**\r\n\r\n1. I used a tool called [NonDex](https://github.com/TestingResearchIllinois/NonDex) to identify the flaky behaviour of the mentioned test.\r\n2. The test can be run with nondex in default mode.\r\n`mvn -pl extensions-core/histogram edu.illinois:nondex-maven-plugin:2.1.1:nondex  -Dtest=org.apache.druid.query.aggregation.histogram.ApproximateHistogramAggregatorTest#testFinalize`.\r\n3.

Description\r\n\r\nOur Kinesis consumer works by using the [GetRecords API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/APIReference/API_GetRecords.html) in some number of `fetchThreads`, each fetching some number of records (`recordsPerFetch`) and each inserting into a shared buffer that can hold a `recordBufferSize` number of records. The logic is described in our documentation at: https://druid.apache.org/docs/27.0.0/development/extensions-core/kinesis-ingestion/#determine-fetch-settings \r\n\r\nThere is a problem with the logic that this pr fixes: the memory limits rely on a hard-coded “estimated record size” that is `10 KB` if `deaggregate: false` and `1 MB` if `deaggregate: true`. There have been cases where a supervisor had `deaggregate: true` set even though it wasn’t needed, leading to under-utilization of memory and poor ingestion performance.\r\n\r\nUsers don’t always know if their records are aggregated or not. Also, even if they could figure it out, it’s better to not have to. So we’d like to eliminate the `deaggregate` parameter, which means we need to do memory management more adaptively based on the actual record sizes.\r\n\r\nWe take advantage of the fact that GetRecords doesn’t return more than 10MB (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/service-sizes-and-limits.html ):\r\n\r\nThis pr: \r\n\r\neliminates `recordsPerFetch`, always use the max limit of 10000 records (the default limit if not set)\r\n\r\neliminate `deaggregate`, always have it true\r\n\r\ncap `fetchThreads` to ensure that if each fetch returns the max (`10MB`) then we don't exceed our budget (`100MB` or `5% of heap`). In practice this means `fetchThreads` will never be more than `10`. Tasks usually don't have that many processors available to them anyway, so in practice I don't think this will change the number of threads for too many deployments\r\n\r\nadd `recordBufferSizeBytes` as a bytes-based limit rather than records-based limit for the shared queue. We do know the byte size of kinesis records by at this point. Default should be `100MB` or `10% of heap`, whichever is smaller.\r\n\r\nadd `maxBytesPerPoll` as a bytes-based limit for how much data we poll from shared buffer at a time. Default is `1000000` bytes.\r\n\r\ndeprecate `recordBufferSize`, use `recordBufferSizeBytes` instead. Warning is logged if `recordBufferSize` is specified\r\n\r\ndeprecate `maxRecordsPerPoll`, use `maxBytesPerPoll` instead. Warning is logged if maxRecordsPerPoll` is specified\r\n\r\nFixed issue that when the record buffer is full, the fetchRecords logic throws away the rest of the GetRecords result after `recordBufferOfferTimeout` and starts a new shard iterator. This seems excessively churny. Instead,  wait an unbounded amount of time for queue to stop being full. If the queue remains full, we’ll end up right back waiting for it after the restarted fetch.\r\n\r\nThere was also a call to `newQ::offer` without check in `filterBufferAndResetBackgroundFetch`, which seemed like it could cause data loss. Now checking return value here, and failing if false.\r\n\r\n### Release Note\r\n\r\nKinesis ingestion memory tuning config has been greatly simplified, and a more adaptive approach is now taken for the configuration. Here is a summary of the changes made:\r\n\r\neliminates `recordsPerFetch`, always use the max limit of 10000 records (the default limit if not set)\r\n\r\neliminate `deaggregate`, always have it true\r\n\r\ncap `fetchThreads` to ensure that if each fetch returns the max (`10MB`) then we don't exceed our budget (`100MB` or `5% of heap`). In practice this means `fetchThreads` will never be more than `10`. Tasks usually don't have that many processors available to them anyway, so in practice I don't think this will change the number of threads for too many deployments\r\n\r\nadd `recordBufferSizeBytes` as a bytes-based limit rather than records-based limit for the shared queue.

issue: https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/14989\r\n\r\nIn pull request #14985, a bug was introduced where periodic refresh would skip rebuilding a datasource's schema after encountering a non-existent datasource. This resulted in remaining datasources having stale schema information.\r\n\r\nThis change addresses the bug and adds a unit test to validate the refresh mechanism's behaviour when a datasource is removed, and other datasources have schema changes.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths,

Description\r\n\r\nArray element indexes are already hiding inside of array type columns, this PR adds a native `array_contains` filter so we can actually use them. Will update PR with performance measurements once I have the chance to actually do them.\r\n\r\nI did consider just making a native \"array element\" filter that would only match if the array contains the match value, instead of the way `array_contains` handles arrays, where it matches if all elements in the array to match against are contained in the array being matched, and having the SQL planner use an external AND filter to implement something like `ARRAY_CONTAINS(arrayColumn, ARRAY[1,2,3])`. We could consider taking that approach instead, but on the other hand, we can still implement `ARRAY_OVERLAP` using this filter as is by breaking up array elements into separate native array contains filters and using an or filter to combine them.\r\n\r\nNo documentation currently added, will do that in a follow-up PR.\r\n\r\nAs expected, this is a giant perf improvement when using `ARRAY_CONTAINS` on array columns. For the query added in the benchmarks:\r\n```\r\nSELECT string1, long1 FROM foo WHERE ARRAY_CONTAINS(\"multi-string3\", 100) GROUP BY 1,2\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```\r\nBenchmark                        (query)  (rowsPerSegment)  (schema)  (vectorize)  Mode  Cnt     Score    Error  Units\r\nSqlExpressionBenchmark.querySql       38           5000000      auto        false  avgt    5  4839.508 ± 89.496  ms/op\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n```\r\nBenchmark                        (query)  (rowsPerSegment)  (schema)  (vectorize)  Mode  Cnt    Score   Error  Units\r\nSqlExpressionBenchmark.querySql       38           5000000      auto        false  avgt    5  137.734 ± 8.147  ms/op\r\n```\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR. Remove this section if there is no corresponding issue. Don't reference the issue in the title of this pull-request. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are a committer, follow the PR action item checklist for committers:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/committer-instructions.md#pr-and-issue-action-item-checklist-for-committers. -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing. If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\nThis patch introduces a param `snapshotTime` in the iceberg inputsource spec that allows the user to ingest data files associated with the most recent snapshot as of the given time. This helps the user ingest data based on older snapshots by specifying the associated snapshot time.\r\nThis patch also upgrades the iceberg core version to `1.4.1`\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code?

For example: -->\r\n\r\nThis pull request resolves a bug where the `segment/count` metric was not being emitted as expected when using the Statsd-emitter. The issue was traced to a discrepancy in the `serviceName` used within the metric name. While the Statsd-emitter was correctly appending the serviceName to the metric name, the configured metric name within the Statsd-emitter did not include the correct serviceName. This mismatch led to a failure during the metric name comparison check, resulting in the segment/count metric not being reported. The configuration has been corrected to include the appropriate serviceName, ensuring that the segment/count metric is now emitted correctly for each service.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #XXXX.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, the redis-cache extension uses Jedis 2.9.0, which was released over seven years ago and [is no longer listed in the official support matrix](https://github.com/redis/jedis#supported-redis-versions). This patch upgrades it to ensure the compatibility with the recent version of Redis and make future upgrades easier, including:\r\n\r\n* Upgrade Jedis to v5.0.2, the latest version at this writing, and address the API changes and dependency version mismatch.\r\n\r\n* Replace mock-jedis with jedis-mock, since the former has not been actively maintained any longer and not compatible with recent versions of Jedis.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid

Clone the repo\r\n   ```\r\n   git clone git clone https://github.com/apache/druid.git\r\n   ```\r\n2.  Install the package\r\n    ```\r\n    mvn install -pl extensions-core/parquet-extensions -am -DskipTests\r\n    ```\r\n3. Run the test in regular runs\r\n     ```\r\n    mvn -pl extensions-core/parquet-extensions test -Dtest=org.apache.druid.data.input.parquet.FlattenSpecParquetReaderTest#testname\r\n    ```\r\n4.

The data reading methods used `createReader()` in those tests do not retrieve data in a consistent order, which can possibly lead to different JSON representations of the same data during test runs.\r\n\r\n**Changes:**\r\n- Imported `fasterxml.jackson` package, and changed from using standard assertion method `Assert` to using `JSONNode` and `ObjectMapper`, which parse two JSON strings and convert them to a tree structure and each node in the trees are compared. Thus, the order of the elements in JSON strings is deterministic and the test passes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects.

Clone the repo\r\n   ```\r\n   git clone git clone https://github.com/apache/druid.git\r\n   ```\r\n2.  Install the package\r\n    ```\r\n    mvn install -pl extensions-core/parquet-extensions -am -DskipTests\r\n    ```\r\n3.

The data reading methods used `createReader()` in those tests do not retrieve data in a consistent order, which can possibly lead to different JSON representations of the same data during test runs.\r\n\r\n**Changes:**\r\n- Imported `fasterxml.jackson` package, and changed from using standard assertion method `Assert` to using `JSONNode` and `ObjectMapper`, which parse two JSON strings and convert them to a tree structure and each node in the trees are compared. Thus, the order of the elements in JSON strings is deterministic and the test passes.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #XXXX.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #XXXX.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

Description\r\nThis PR fixes auto-compaction to properly preserve spatial dimensions. Prior to this fix, spatial dimensions would be rewritten into regular string dimensions, losing their spatial indexes.\r\n\r\nI went back and tested stuff in versions over the last few years, and all of them had this flaw, at least for as far back as I went. It seems plausible that auto compaction has never supported spatial dimensions - which isn't particularly surprising since they are not commonly used afaik, at least I haven't seen them much, and are not supported in SQL.\r\n\r\nI personally think spatial dimensions would be a lot better suited to be modernized as a complex dimension instead of piggy-backing off of strings, but that said, using compaction on them shouldn't destroy them if you went to the trouble of creating them in the first place. \r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\nThis PR adds support for using expressions to compute the json path argument for `JSON_VALUE` and `JSON_QUERY` functions. Note that when using a path expression that isn't a constant, Druid cannot take advantage of the specialized virtual column typically used, and so must fall back to a pure expression virtual column to compute the values from the 'raw' json blob, which will be much less performant than if the path is constant and known up front.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x] been

However, HashSet does not guarantee the ordering of elements and thus resulting in these flaky tests that assume deterministic implementation of HashSet. Thus, when the NonDex tool shuffles the HashSet elements, it results in the test failures:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n[ERROR] org.apache.druid.math.expr.ParserTest.testApplyFunctions\r\n[ERROR]   Run 1: ParserTest.testApplyFunctions:521->validateParser:823 x + map((x) -> x + 1, y) expected:<[x, y]> but was:<[y, x]>\r\n\r\n[ERROR] org.apache.druid.math.expr.ParserTest.testFunctions\r\n[ERROR]   Run 1: ParserTest.testFunctions:453->validateParser:799->validateParser:831 if(cond,then,else) expected:<[then, cond, else]> but was:<[then, else, cond]>\r\n\r\n[ERROR] org.apache.druid.math.expr.ParserTest.testSimpleAdditivityOp1\r\n[ERROR]   Run 1: ParserTest.testSimpleAdditivityOp1:180->validateParser:799->validateParser:831 x-y expected:<[x, y]> but was:<[y, x]>\r\n\r\n[ERROR] org.apache.druid.math.expr.ParserTest.testSimpleAdditivityOp2\r\n[ERROR]   Run 1: ParserTest.testSimpleAdditivityOp2:186->validateParser:799->validateParser:823 x+y+z expected:<[x, y, z]> but was:<[z, x, y]>\r\n\r\n[ERROR] org.apache.druid.math.expr.ParserTest.testSimpleLogicalOps1\r\n[ERROR]   Run 1: ParserTest.testSimpleLogicalOps1:165->validateParser:799->validateParser:831 x>y expected:<[x, y]> but was:<[y, x]>\r\n\r\n[ERROR] org.apache.druid.math.expr.ParserTest.testSimpleMultiplicativeOp1\r\n[ERROR]   Run 1: ParserTest.testSimpleMultiplicativeOp1:197->validateParser:799->validateParser:823 x*y expected:<[x, y]> but was:<[y, x]>\r\n\r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 35, Failures: 6, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo reproduce run:\r\n```\r\nmvn -pl processing edu.illinois:nondex-maven-plugin:2.1.1:nondex -Dtest=org.apache.druid.math.expr.ParserTestx\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects.

(The code change can be found in this [draft PR](https://github.com/yashdeep97/druid/pull/1/files))\r\nHowever, I noticed for some tests, the order of elements in the expected outputs was different from the order of insertion in the LinkedHashSet being created. Which makes me think that the developers created the expected values based on the most probable order rather than the order of insertion. Hence, I believe it would be safe to use getRequiredBindings and compare the sets without making tests weaker.\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `org.apache.druid.math.expr.ParserTest`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are a committer, follow the PR action item checklist for committers:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/committer-instructions.md#pr-and-issue-action-item-checklist-for-committers. -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I am proposing a fix for a flaky test identified in `org.apache.druid.storage.s3.S3DataSegmentPusherConfigTest.testSerializationWithDefaults`.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, and what problem are you fixing. If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\nThe mentioned test compares two strings. An `ObjectMapper` variable is being leveraged to carry out the serialization and deserialization process. The serialization process internally leverages a `getDeclaredFields()` function. As per [Javadoc](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Class.html#getDeclaredFields--),\r\n> The elements in the returned array are not sorted and are not in any particular order.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\nIn order to overcome this problem,  I am proposing to use a Map to serialize the strings before they are compared. The usage of Map before the comparison occurs shifts the focus of validation to evaluating the key-value pairs rather than the order in which they are serialized.\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\nPatch that I have developed:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/krishnanand5/druid/pull/2/commits/2a6cf8be285911990ff257de075a9ecb59a864f7\r\n\r\nSteps to verify the patch:\r\n\r\n1. `https://github.com/apache/druid.git`.\r\n2. `mvn install -pl extensions-core/s3-extensions -am -DskipTests`.\r\n3. `mvn -pl extensions-core/s3-extensions test -Dtest=S3DataSegmentPusherConfigTest#testSerializationWithDefaults`.\r\n4. `mvn -pl extensions-core/s3-extensions edu.illinois:nondex-maven-plugin:2.1.1:nondex -Dtest=S3DataSegmentPusherConfigTest#testSerializationWithDefaults`.\r\n5.

Description\r\nThis is a follow-up to https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/15282. I missed a few instances of type checkers being used which internally used the `OperandTypes.LITERAL`, causing the same issue as described in the mentioned PR.

a couple bugs with some of the AbstractTask.run implementation that was added to support mmless ingestion..\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nIf a task in mmless ingestion fails during setup(), then cleanup is called with taskStatus=TaskStatus.running(getId()) because of a error in the logic. This can cause issues because then the overlord will think the task is running when in reality it has exited.\r\n\r\nSeparately, as a part of https://github.com/apache/druid/commit/dc0b163e192545c802b7fe2b3271e035cc1e70ff, mmless ingestion will normally report the status to the overlord in the UpdateStatusAction api call, with the deep storage status.json being just a backup option. When this status is reported, the error message is dropped because UpdateStateAction only takes in a string instead of a TaskStatus object. To fix this, I added a TaskStatus field to the UpdateStatusAction (i left the string value in for backwards compatibility).\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nFix some error reporting with mmless ingestion\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `AbstractTask`\r\n * `UpdateStatusAction`\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes a bug introduced because of https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/15107. \r\nIf the batch size is large and there are more than 120 intervals in the used segment fetch query, it may fail with the following error:\r\n` java.sql.SQLSyntaxErrorException: Statement too complex.`\r\n\r\nSince a KillTask operates with an EXCLUSIVE lock, the set of used segments cannot change in between the task unless there is a revokal.\r\n\r\nChanges in this PR:\r\n1. Fetch the used segment set exactly once before processing any of the batches because of the above assumption.\r\n2. Fetch all `non-revoked` locks of the task before each batch to ensure that none of them were revoked in between batch processing. This ensures that we kill only those segments which are currently locked by the kill task.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test Druid

segments retrieval fails when there are too many intervals (about 120 with Derby).  Same thing can happen with multiple intervals as with unused segments.\r\n\r\nPreviously, the intervals weren't capped in the SQL query and is bloated by the fact that we add grouped `OR` clause per interval to handle the eternity interval [here](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/server/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/metadata/SqlSegmentsMetadataQuery.java#L295). This PR splits up the `SELECT` query into multiple batches, with 100 intervals/batch. This is similar to the batching strategy with a cap on max number of segments announced at [once](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/server/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/metadata/IndexerSQLMetadataStorageCoordinator.java#L106).\r\n\r\n```\r\norg.skife.jdbi.v2.exceptions.CallbackFailedException: org.skife.jdbi.v2.exceptions.UnableToCreateStatementException: \r\n\r\njava.sql.SQLSyntaxErrorException: Statement too complex. Try rewriting the query to remove complexity. Eliminating many duplicate expressions or breaking up the query and storing interim results in a temporary table can often help resolve this error. \r\n[statement:\"SELECT payload FROM foo WHERE used = :used AND dataSource = :dataSource AND ((start < :end0 AND \\\"end\\\" > :start0) OR (start = '-146136543-09-08T08:23:32.096Z' AND \"end\" != '146140482-04-24T15:36:27.903Z' AND \"end\" > :start0) OR (start != '-146136543-09-08T08:23:32.096Z' AND \"end\" = '146140482-04-24T15:36:27.903Z' AND start < :end0) OR (start < :end1 AND \\\"end\\\" > :start1) OR (start = '-146136543-09-08T08:23:32.096Z' AND \"end\" != '146140482-04-24T15:36:27.903Z' AND \"end\" > :start1) OR (start != '-146136543-09-08T08:23:32.096Z' AND \"end\" = '146140482-04-24T15:36:27.903Z' AND start < :end1) OR (start < :end2 AND \\\"end\\\"\r\n```\r\nCore changes:\r\n- Segment retrieval is batched at the storage layer by intervals. It's capped at 100 intervals per batch.\r\n- With multiple batches, the iterators are concatenated together and returned to the caller.\r\n- Add a combination of unit tests that test the different scenarios with limit in, at and out of range scenarios with used and unused segments retrieval.\r\n\r\nA fix localized to kill tasks that originally exposed this bug is available here - [#15306](https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/15306). We'd still separately want this change in the server as the issue can happen more broadly.\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be!

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses the need for better monitoring of compaction task failures by introducing two new metrics:\r\n\r\n`task/failed/acquireLock/count`: Tracks the number of times a compaction task fails to acquire a lock. This metric is useful for identifying transient issues, such as conflicts with other ingestion jobs. To filter compaction tasks, look for group id starting with `coordinator-issued_compact`\r\n\r\n`compact/failed/schemaError/count`: Monitors the number of compaction failures due to schema mismatches within the same interval. This metric requires user intervention for resolution.\r\n\r\nBy adding these metrics, we aim to provide more granular insights into the different types of compaction failures, enabling quicker diagnosis and resolution.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\nAdded two new metrics `task/failed/acquireLock/count` and `compact/failed/schemaError/count` for monitoring compaction failures.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `LockAcquisitionFailedException` indicate that a lock acquisition has failed\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

PR revives https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/14978 with a few more bells and whistles. Instead of an unconditional cross-join, we will now split the join condition such that some conditions are now evaluated post-join. To decide what sub-condition goes where, I have refactored `DruidJoinRule` class to extract unsupported sub-conditions. We build a postJoinFilter out of these unsupported sub-conditions and push to the join. \r\n\r\nRelease notes \r\nDruid can support arbitrary join conditions for INNER join. For INNER joins, druid will look at the join condition, and any sub-conditions that cannot be evaluated efficiently as part of the join, will be converted to a post-join filter. With this feature, you can do in-equality joins that were not possible before. \r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

running queries on real time tasks using MSQ, there is an issue with queries with certain order by columns.\r\n\r\n If the query specifies a non time column, the query is planned as it is supported by

Description\r\nDruid does not support various forms of auth that Azure Storage Accounts has added support for, like Service Client auth, Workload Identity Auth (e.g. for AKS) or managed identity Auth. Adding the AzureDefaultCredential chain to the azure clients druid uses allows support for configuring these things. See: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/java/api/overview/azure/identity-readme?view=azure-java-stable\r\n\r\nIn order to support this new identity library, I had to upgrade the druid azure client libraries for blob storage (they were very old and deprecated anyways).\r\n\r\n#### Fixed the bug ...\r\n#### Renamed the class ...\r\n#### Added a forbidden-apis entry ...\r\n- Many of the changes from the client upgrade were pretty straightforward (I used this .NET docs a lot: https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/main/sdk/storage/Azure.Storage.Blobs/AzureStorageNetMigrationV12.md#class-conversion-reference)\r\n- Most of these changes are in AzureStorage\r\nLess straightforward changes\r\n- The client supports retrying requests by default, so I removed instances of RetryUtils in favor of using the client directly. There are several places where druid uses a different retry configuration for different azure operations, so I had to add AzureClientFactory to support creating additional clients on the fly (because the library doesn't let you override the retry policy on existing clients). I also updated AzureStorage to reuse these per-container overrided clients, the new client is stateless so it is technically fine to just recreate a client each time but i figured it would be better to reuse them as a performance optimization. A couple of the tests were removed because they were testing this retry functionality\r\n- I had to change the AzureCloudBlobIterator because the new client supports pagination by default (it only fetches additional pages if you request additional items)\r\n#### Release note\r\n- Upgrade druid azure client libraries\r\n- Support AzureDefaultCredential for druid auth to azure services\r\n- I removed some of the mocks from the tests and added a test implementation (TestPagedResponse). This let me remove the ListBlobItemHolder class that was mostly there for testing.\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n* AzureClientFactory\r\n* AzureAccountConfig\r\n* AzureCloudBlobIterator\r\n* AzureStorage\r\n* AzureStorageDruidModule\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

cluster.\r\n\r\nI have tested the following scenarios for auth\r\nSAS token auth\r\nKey auth\r\nWorkload identity auth (using a k8s serviceAccount and managed identity to mount credentials for druid running on a pod in AKS)\r\nEnvironment variable auth (using a App registration client id/secret)\r\nManaged identity auth (I technically have not tested this directly on a VM, but I am pretty sure this will work on a VM with a managed identity by setting the managedIdentityClientId property https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/wiki/Azure-Identity-Examples#authenticating-in-azure-with-managed-identity)\r\nTechnically the AzureDefaultCredential supports more types of auth but I did not test any of them.\r\n\r\nI also tested the following migration scenarios\r\nCluster running old azure extension using a sas token -> new azure extension using a sas token\r\nSas token (new client)
