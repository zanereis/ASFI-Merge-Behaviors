go\r\n\r\nWe separated timeout in go's TSocket into connect timeout and socket\r\ntimeout in 81334cd, this change does the same for TSSLSocket to keep\r\nthem consistent.\r\n\r\nAlso rename the arg in NewTSocketFromConnTimeout from connTimeout to\r\nsocketTimeout, because in that function we already have a connection,\r\nso connect timeout is never used again. The timeout passed into that\r\nfunction is really for socket timeout, not connect timeout.

netstd\r\n\r\n<!-- Explain the changes in the pull request below: -->\r\n- Added a new constructor `THttpTransport.cs` allowing the consumer to pass in their own `HttpClient`\r\n- Refactored the configuration of the `_httpClient` field so that both constructors will add standard headers to the client\r\n- Added a public static method to get a `HttpMessageHandler` with the same compression-decompression algorithms used by the previous constructor, this will allow users to create the client with the same behaviour as before\r\n\r\n<!-- We recommend you review the checklist/tips before submitting a pull request. -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Did you create an [Apache Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/THRIFT/issues/) ticket?  (not required for trivial changes)\r\n- [x] If a ticket exists: Does your pull request title follow the pattern \"THRIFT-NNNN: describe my issue\"?\r\n- [x] Did you squash your changes to a single commit?  (not required, but preferred)\r\n- [x] Did you do your best to avoid breaking changes?  If one was needed, did you label the Jira ticket with \"Breaking-Change\"?\r\n- [ ] If your change does not involve any code, include `[skip ci]` anywhere in the commit message to free up build resources.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  The Contributing Guide at:\r\n  https://github.com/apache/thrift/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n  has more details and tips for committing

go\r\n\r\nAs discussed in the JIRA ticket, this commit changes how we handle I/O\r\ntimeouts in the go library.\r\n\r\nThis is a breaking change that adds context to all Read*, Write*, and\r\nSkip functions to TProtocol, along with the compiler change to support\r\nthat, and also adds context to TStandardClient.Recv, TDeserializer,\r\nTStruct, and a few others.\r\n\r\nAlong with the function signature changes, this commit also implements\r\ncontext cancellation check in the following TProtocol's ReadMessageBegin\r\nimplementations:\r\n\r\n- TBinaryProtocol\r\n- TCompactProtocol\r\n- THeaderProtocol\r\n\r\nIn those ReadMessageBegin implementations, if the passed in context\r\nobject has a deadline attached, it will keep retrying the I/O timeout\r\nerrors, until the deadline on the context object passed. They won't\r\nretry I/O timeout errors if the passed in context does not have a\r\ndeadline attached (still return on the first error).\r\n\r\n<!-- Explain the changes in the pull request below: -->\r\n  \r\n\r\n<!-- We recommend you review the checklist/tips before submitting a pull request. -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Did you create an [Apache Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/THRIFT/issues/) ticket?

(not required, but preferred)\r\n- [x] Did you do your best to avoid breaking changes?  If one was needed, did you label the Jira ticket with \"Breaking-Change\"?\r\n- [ ] If your change does not involve any code, include `[skip ci]` anywhere in the commit message to free up build resources.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  The Contributing Guide at:\r\n  https://github.com/apache/thrift/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n  has more details and tips for committing

go\r\n\r\nThis is a slightly different, and less error-prone approach from the\r\nfix in e382275.\r\n\r\nThe previous approach relies on passing the set socket timeout into the\r\nunderlying socketConn from TSocket and TSSLSocket. But since we have so\r\nmany different constructors for TSocket and TSSLSocket, some makes the\r\ninitial connection in the constructor and some does not, there are so\r\nmany different places we would need to remember to pass socketTimeout\r\ninto socketConn. In the future, when we add another constructor to them,\r\nwe could either forget to pass the socket timeout into socketConn, or\r\ntry to pass it while we haven't constructed socketConn yet (which will\r\ncause panic), both are bad.\r\n\r\nIn this approach we just clear the read deadline in the connectivity\r\ncheck read. Because that's a non-blocking read, it would work just fine\r\nwithout a read deadline.\r\n\r\n<!-- Explain the changes in the pull request below: -->\r\n  \r\n\r\n<!-- We recommend you review the checklist/tips before submitting a pull request. -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Did you create an [Apache Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/THRIFT/issues/) ticket?

go\r\n\r\nWhile debugging the issue in THRIFT-5214, I original thought that was a\r\nbug in TFramedTransport implementation, so I took some time scrutinize\r\nthe TFramedTransport code. Although in the end there's no bug, the\r\ncurrent implementation of TFramedTransport, especially in the Read\r\nfunction, has some weird handling while at frame boundary, which is both\r\nerror-prone and hard to follow (I did found and fixed one bug there in\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/thrift/pull/1810 before).\r\n\r\nThe new implementation reads the whole frame into a buffer, which would\r\nuse slightly more memory, but it follows the pattern of TFramedTransport\r\nimplementation of other languages (e.g. Java), and also the pattern we\r\nhandle frame in THeaderTransport. It also reduced the complexity and\r\nweirdness of the frame boundary handling in Read implementation.\r\n\r\nThis rewrite also removes the print call from library code.\r\n\r\n<!-- Explain the changes in the pull request below: -->\r\n  \r\n\r\n<!-- We recommend you review the checklist/tips before submitting a pull request. -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Did you create an [Apache Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/THRIFT/issues/) ticket?

netstd build writes so-called `TargetFrameworkMonikerAssemblyAttributes` files to `/tmp`. These files can be left behind, and they do not feature a build-specific or user-specific name. This can be a problem in a multi-user environment, because the files block future builds by other users (that can not overwrite the files).\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a workaround by placing the files into the build directory rather than the `/tmp` directory. There should be no negative effects, other than a new, extra line in the `Thrift.csproj` settings.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Did you create an [Apache Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/THRIFT/issues/) ticket?

PR adds a very minor change: it deprecates handling of WinXP and Windows Server 2003 in `lib/cpp/src/thrift/windows/WinFcntl.{h,cpp}`. This simplifies code maintenance. I'm under the impression that support for WinXP should be dropped now.\r\n\r\nDoes this require an explicit mention in a change log? I would assume that WinXP and Server 2003 are not officially supported since a while now?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Did you create an [Apache Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/THRIFT/issues/) ticket?  (not required for trivial changes)\r\n- [ ] If a ticket exists: Does your pull request title follow the pattern \"THRIFT-NNNN: describe my issue\"?\r\n- [x] Did you squash your changes to a single commit?  (not required, but preferred)\r\n- [x] Did you do your best to avoid breaking changes?  If one was needed, did you label the Jira ticket with \"Breaking-Change\"?\r\n- [x] If your change does not involve any code, include `[skip ci]` anywhere in the commit message to free up build resources.","created_at":"2020-06-02T09:45:59Z","updated_at":"2020-09-14T09:33:12Z","closed_at":"2020-09-12T16:52:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"275483e16aafb5e524a2cfb531f63a1f5b9d62a6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/pulls/2165/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/pulls/2165/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/2165/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/statuses/60eebc95f9ffc4abf3a9e25bea5689d98ba1515f","head":{"label":"BioDataAnalysis:bda_deprecate_winxp","ref":"bda_deprecate_winxp","sha":"60eebc95f9ffc4abf3a9e25bea5689d98ba1515f","user":{"login":"BioDataAnalysis","id":14963143,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjE0OTYzMTQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14963143?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis","html_url":"https://github.com/BioDataAnalysis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":87579154,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4NzU3OTE1NA==","name":"thrift","full_name":"BioDataAnalysis/thrift","private":false,"owner":{"login":"BioDataAnalysis","id":14963143,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjE0OTYzMTQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14963143?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis","html_url":"https://github.com/BioDataAnalysis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/BioDataAnalysis/thrift","description":"Mirror

Explain the changes in the pull request below: -->\r\n  Swift should handle union type (enum) correctly when packing into a\r\nstruct type for sending.\r\n \r\n Note that union types are essentially structs with all optionals, so a specific check on the enum parent type is needed to expose the correct union choice/enum during Mirror reflection.\r\n\r\n<!-- We recommend you review the checklist/tips before submitting a pull request. -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Did you create an [Apache Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/THRIFT/issues/) ticket?  (not required for trivial changes)\r\n- [x] If a ticket exists: Does your pull request title follow the pattern \"THRIFT-NNNN: describe my issue\"?\r\n- [x] Did you squash your changes to a single commit?  (not required, but preferred)\r\n- [x] Did you do your best to avoid breaking changes?  If one was needed, did you label the Jira ticket with \"Breaking-Change\"?\r\n- [x] If your change does not involve any code, include `[skip ci]` anywhere in the commit message to free up build resources.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  The Contributing Guide at:\r\n  https://github.com/apache/thrift/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n  has more details and tips for committing

cpp\r\n\r\nSeveral race conditions were present in TNonblockingServer when\r\nTNonblockingServer::stop() method was called concurrently with initialization of\r\nthe server (which takes place in TNonblockingServer::serve()).\r\n\r\n 1. Thrift server uses a bidirectional pipe to notify its IO threads that they\r\n    should exit.\r\n    The pipe was created in the TNonblockingIOThread::registerEvents() method,\r\n    which is called by the IO thread itself.\r\n    Since the pipe was created _after_ the thread which was supposed to receive\r\n    the message, there was a short time window, when such request could be\r\n    undelivered.\r\n    In that case, the thread would never exit and Thrift could prevent the whole\r\n    application from terminating cleanly.\r\n    To fix this issue, the call to createNotificationPipe() has been moved to\r\n    the constructor of TNonblockingIOThread.\r\n    Breaking change: the TNonblockingIOThread constructor may now throw an\r\n    exception if pipe creation fails. However, the only caller of that\r\n    method (TNonblockingServer::registerEvents()) could already throw due to\r\n    unrelated errors.\r\n\r\n 2. Accesses to TNonblockingServer::ioThreads_ vector were unsynchronized.\r\n    In most cases this was irrelevant, because the vector is modified only\r\n    during initialization and destruction of the server.\r\n    However, in one scenario, creation of new threads (which may result in\r\n    reallocation of the vector) could race with iteration over the container in\r\n    TNonblockingServer::stop() method.\r\n    This issue has been fixed by wrapping the code in a critical section.\r\n\r\n<!-- Explain the changes in the pull request below: -->\r\n  \r\n\r\n<!-- We recommend you review the checklist/tips before submitting a pull request. -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Did you create an [Apache Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/THRIFT/issues/) ticket?

building components that use an external build tool (like Java gradle or Javascript grunt), cmake does currently not track if a rebuild is required. This PR creates a cmake-dependency between the sources and the target of these components \"Java\" and \"Javascript\". Assuming that all sources are fully contained in their respective component folder, cmake can infer if a require is required (i.e. the target is missing or one or more sources are more current). This drastically reduces build times.\r\n\r\nHowever please be aware that if the dependency between sources and target should *not* be complete for some reason, then cmake may miss to rebuild a component.

to indicate an error).\r\n\r\nThis causes an infinite loop today because the code assumes 0 only means a temporary failure to write, rather than a permanent one. \r\n\r\nThis change adds a check to

PR adds support for domain sockets for Windows.\r\n\r\nIn order to implement this change I've changed a basic property of C++ build configuration for Windows. This would not be strictly required but is quite helpful. Domain sockets are only available on recent versions of the Windows platform SDK. Therefore I've enabled the automatic configuration of `config.h` with cmake. I've checked the results and on my platform(s) the generated config header is sensible and matches the hard-coded default. However this change is not easily portable to autotools.\r\n\r\nDuring the implementation I found a number of minor issues in TServerSocket and TSocket that I believe are improved in this PR. None of these changes should be a breaking change. Mostly some methods should not be called on a domain socket and have been excluded. Also, the variable `listening_` was set to `true` at the beginning of the `listen()` method but I found that this opens a small time window where `listening_` is true but the socket is not actually listening (yet).\r\n\r\nPlease review and let me know if there is anything to discuss?\r\n\r\nI've tested this implementation successfully on MSVC 2017 and 2019, on Ubuntu 18.04 x86_64 and on MacOS 14 with XCode 11.3.\r\n\r\n- [x] I created Apache Jira Ticket https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/THRIFT-5187\r\n- [x] If a ticket exists: Does your pull request title follow the pattern \"THRIFT-NNNN: describe my issue\"?\r\n- [x] Did you squash your changes to a single commit?

see the [Jira issue][THRIFT-5186] for rationale. Basically, this patch enables Thrift clients & servers to continue working in \"offline mode\" — when only the loopback interace `lo` (127.0.0.1) is available, nothing more.\r\n\r\nWith Thrift 0.13.0 on POSIX, C++ and Python clients/servers **crash with exception** in those conditions.\r\n\r\nThis patch is used internally in our team, to compile a *vendored* version of Thrift. We'd like to contribute this patch upstream, to relieve ourselves from the maintenance burden of vendoring.\r\n\r\nCode review, comments, suggestions welcome!\r\n\r\n[THRIFT-5186]: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/THRIFT-5186\r\n\r\nNB: no attempt was made to cover this patch with tests. Suggestions on how to simulate \"no network\" environment in the test suite would be highly appreciated.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n- [x] Did you create an Apache Jira ticket?

Explain the changes in the pull request below: -->\r\nClient: go\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a simple middleware framework for Go servers.\r\n\r\nIt provides:\r\n\r\n1. A `ProcessorMiddleware` function interface used to define the actual middleware\r\n2. `WrapProcessor`, the function that you use to wrap a `TProcessor` in a list of middleware\r\n3. A helper `WrappedTProcessorFunction` struct to help with developing middleware.\r\n\r\nThis is may be breaking change for any custom implementations of the `TProcessor` interface, but should not effect the code generated by compiling Thrift files.  It adds two functions to the interface that are a part of the generated `TProcessor` code, but were not defined in the interface explicitly.\r\n\r\n<!-- We recommend you review the checklist/tips before submitting a pull request. -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Did you create an [Apache Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/THRIFT/issues/) ticket?  (not required for trivial changes)\r\n- [x] If a ticket exists: Does your pull request title follow the pattern \"THRIFT-NNNN: describe my issue\"?\r\n- [x] Did you squash your changes to a single commit?  (not required, but preferred)\r\n- [x] Did you do your best to avoid breaking changes?  If one was needed, did you label the Jira ticket with \"Breaking-Change\"?\r\n- [x] If your change does not involve any code, add ` [skip ci]` at the end of your pull request to free up build resources.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  The Contributing Guide at:\r\n  https://github.com/apache/thrift/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n  has more details and tips for committing

PR adds cmake support for the C# netstd implementation. The major changes are only in cmake and in the Visual Studio project files. The actual build is executed via `dotnet` (which has to be installed). cmake only orchestrates the build and can install the build artifacts.\r\n\r\nA major change is that this PR fixes issue https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/THRIFT-5143 for me. The required change is that the Thrift build for netstandard 2.0 can not be mixed and mingled with application builds for netstandard 2.0 or .net Framework, due to a missing dependency to reference assembly `System.Threading.Tasks.Extensions, Version=4.2.0.1`. This can be resolved by referencing the Thrift library artifact instead of the Thrift project file. See the Jira issue for a more detailed discussion.\r\n\r\nI've tested the build on Windows, macOS and Linux successfully.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Did you create an [Apache Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/THRIFT/issues/) ticket?  (not required for trivial changes)\r\n- [ ] If a ticket exists: Does your pull request title follow the pattern \"THRIFT-NNNN: describe my issue\"?\r\n- [x] Did you squash your changes to a single commit?  (not required, but preferred)\r\n   - Full cmake support is in a single commit. There are two other, minor changes to C# code in two other commits in this same PR.\r\n- [x] Did you do your best to avoid breaking changes?  If one was needed, did you label the Jira ticket with \"Breaking-Change\"?\r\n- [x] If your change does not involve any code, add ` [skip ci]` at the end of your pull request to free up build resources.","created_at":"2020-04-24T16:28:47Z","updated_at":"2022-04-16T17:44:11Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2161598689,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTYxNTk4Njg5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/labels/rebase%20needed","name":"rebase

change has mostly an impact on Windows. Currently Thrift does not resolve error strings on Windows (for me). A typical error message may look like `Could not bind: errno = 10049`. With C++11 the newer formatting method `strerror_s()` is available on MSVC, however it fails to resolve many error messages. The most complete error handling on MSVC is possible only via Windows methods.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds support for decoding error codes on MSVC via `FormatMessageA()` into an ASCII string. In effect, above error id `10049` can be decoded as `Could not bind: The requested address is not valid in its context`.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, on platforms that do not have `strerror_r` available (non-Posix systems), this PR turns to `strerror_s` from C++11 to decode the message.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Did you create an [Apache Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/THRIFT/issues/) ticket?  (not required for trivial changes)\r\n- [ ] If a ticket exists: Does your pull request title follow the pattern \"THRIFT-NNNN: describe my issue\"?\r\n- [x] Did you squash your changes to a single commit?  (not required, but preferred)\r\n- [x] Did you do your best to avoid breaking changes?  If one was needed, did you label the Jira ticket with \"Breaking-Change\"?\r\n- [x] If your change does not involve any code, add ` [skip ci]` at the end of your pull request to free up build resources.","created_at":"2020-04-22T15:47:23Z","updated_at":"2020-04-24T16:48:52Z","closed_at":"2020-04-24T09:44:42Z","merged_at":"2020-04-24T09:44:42Z","merge_commit_sha":"04574379a43dd2a05766f3e06eb9852a9b6fa5da","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/pulls/2109/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/pulls/2109/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/2109/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/statuses/6b82a55485c34c9939dc64f912306e0f435608c2","head":{"label":"BioDataAnalysis:bda_add_better_errno_print_for_win","ref":"bda_add_better_errno_print_for_win","sha":"6b82a55485c34c9939dc64f912306e0f435608c2","user":{"login":"BioDataAnalysis","id":14963143,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjE0OTYzMTQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14963143?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis","html_url":"https://github.com/BioDataAnalysis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":87579154,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4NzU3OTE1NA==","name":"thrift","full_name":"BioDataAnalysis/thrift","private":false,"owner":{"login":"BioDataAnalysis","id":14963143,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjE0OTYzMTQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14963143?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis","html_url":"https://github.com/BioDataAnalysis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BioDataAnalysis/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/BioDataAnalysis/thrift","description":"Mirror
