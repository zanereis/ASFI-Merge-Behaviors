new test will catch errors such as the one addressed in https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/15825/files#diff-3edb3abd8909e7075e679e8b93420d4119858d6a9418b6ec10a204a592f062abR444.\r\n\r\nThe problem was that `WriteRename` is no-op unless we have temp tables. Previously those tests were for triggered sources only, so for untriggered expansion, we were getting a false sense of security. Unit test for `WriteRename` itself supplies its own side inputs, so it is not an end-to-end test involving code in question.\r\n\r\nTested with previous error to verify that the test indeed fails.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

implements the missing writer for Kinesis on AWS SDKV v2, one of the big milestones to get feature parity between the SDK v1 and v2 based IOs.\r\n\r\nCurrently the Kinesis Producer Library (KPL) is not available for SDK v2. Instead, this implements the writer using the async Kinesis client.\r\n\r\nThere's two different writer modes available:\r\n- A default writer that asynchronously batches records to Kinesis with configurable concurrency.\r\n- An aggregated record writer compatible with KPL / KCL record aggregation that is implemented on top of the default writer.\r\n\r\nWhile record aggregation is compatible with KPL / KCL, aggregation here a lot less aggressive.\r\nOnly records with the same effective hash key are aggregated to keep complexity manageable. Otherwise, the aggregator would have to be aware of the most up-to-date explicit hash key ranges per shard and react promptly to resharding to not risk data being silently dropped on the consumer side.\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/kinesis-kpl-concepts.html#kinesis-kpl-concepts-aggretation \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

attempt to match user expectations by giving every element across all\r\nshards a unique index. Previously this was done by embedding the filepath\r\nitself in the index, but this would result in this (often quite long) path\r\nbeing duplicated for every element (sometimes exceeding the size of the\r\ndata itself).\r\n\r\nAs we expand the full set of shards before doing the actual reading,\r\nwe can use an upper bound on the count to shift the indices of each shard\r\nto ensure uniqueness. A nice, round power of ten is used for the shift to\r\nvisually make it easy to see where the indices come from if they are ever\r\nexposed to the user.\r\n\r\nIn addition, fixes a bug where the file splitting was not taken into\r\naccount when doing index uniquification.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/15739. As suggested [here](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-13073?focusedCommentId=17447601&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-17447601) by @tvalentyn, there seems to be performance regression when using only `-XX:+AlwaysActAsServerClassMachine` (which leads to G1GC). We believe ParallelGC is the most suitable here, considering it is used on Java 8 (used by most pipelines) and designed for high throughput.\r\n\r\nNote I left some comments with the reasoning for this flag and left `-XX:+AlwaysActAsServerClassMachine`. Let me know if it should be different.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
