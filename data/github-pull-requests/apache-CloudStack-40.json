Description\r\n\r\nBy default, once we create a security group we cant change its name.\r\nIn this feature, we introduce a new API command \"updateSecurityGroup\"\r\nwhich allows us to rename the security group name. Although we can't\r\nchange the name of the \"default\" security group.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce? Put an `x` in all the boxes that apply: -->\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [X] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n## Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\nNavigate to \"Network\" section in the main window and select \"Security groups\" from the drop-down menu in the top left section\r\n\r\nClick on \"Add Security group\" to create a new security group\r\n![Screenshot 2019-12-03 at 16 04 49](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10645273/70062690-d21d0500-15e6-11ea-84fb-d955d3b66b0e.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce the security group is created you can rename it using the edit button\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2019-12-03 at 16 06 33](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10645273/70062740-e52fd500-15e6-11ea-9465-01c43d58ae5b.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\n1. Navigate to \"Network\" tab in the main UI.\r\n2. Select \"Security groups\" from the drop-down menu in the top left.\r\n3. Click on \"Add Security group\" on the top right to create a new security group.\r\n4. Give any suitable name and create it.\r\n5. Now select the security group you just created and click on edit button to enter the new name\r\n![Screenshot 2019-12-03 at 16 02 45](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10645273/70062465-5ae77100-15e6-11ea-9e64-aab176ccf91f.png)\r\n6. This will rename the security group to the new name\r\n7. Now again try to edit the security group name and enter blank spaces. You will get error message which indicates that security group name cannot be empty.\r\n![Screenshot 2019-12-03 at 16 04 01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10645273/70062556-8a967900-15e6-11ea-8325-cd8beb597ab1.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nNew integration test case has been added which validates different test cases in updating the security group name.

Description\r\n\r\nCurrently while creating ingress/egress rule for a security group,\r\nwe can specify only TCP/UDP/ICMP. Sometimes we need to add rules\r\nfor different protocol numbers or rules for all the above three\r\nmentioned protocols.\r\n\r\nIn this new feature, users can specify the protocol number or select\r\n\"ALL\" option which will apply rules for TCP/UDP/ICMP in one shot\r\n\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce? Put an `x` in all the boxes that apply: -->\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [X] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n## Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\nNavigate to \"Networks\" and select \"Security groups\" from the drop-down menu on the top left\r\nSelect any security group name and click on either \"ingress\" or \"egress\" tab\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2019-12-03 at 09 44 05](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10645273/70035613-79804480-15b3-11ea-9a40-5afaf9ace557.png)\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2019-12-03 at 09 45 11](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10645273/70035632-83a24300-15b3-11ea-921c-23ae451d0131.png)\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2019-12-03 at 09 45 44](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10645273/70035639-87ce6080-15b3-11ea-8101-8998e8a20567.png)\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nAdding a rule for a particular protocol number\r\n\r\n1. Create a VM and note down the security group name to which it belongs to\r\n2. Navigate to \"Network\" and select \"Security groups\" from the drop-down menu on the top left.\r\n3. Select the security group which is obtained from step 1.\r\n4. Click on either ingress or egress tab\r\n5. Try to create a new rule by selecting \"Protocol number\" from the drop-down list.\r\n     For ex: Enter protocol number as 47 and cidr as \"99.99.99.99/32\"\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2019-12-03 at 10 12 57](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10645273/70036799-c402c080-15b5-11ea-9560-8f8f4d2d5801.png)\r\n\r\n6. Now get the hostname on which the VM is running and ssh to it.\r\n7. Run the iptables-save command to ensure that there is a new rule for the protocol number you mentioned above.\r\n    The output should be as shown below\r\n\r\n```\r\n# iptables-save | grep 99.99.99\r\n-A i-2-118-VM -s 99.99.99.99/32 -p gre -j ACCEPT\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdding a rule to all TCP/UDP/ICMP at a time\r\n\r\n1. Create a VM and note down the security group name to which it belongs to\r\n2. By default, there will be a drop action for the three protocols.\r\n2. Navigate to \"Network\" and select \"Security groups\" from the drop-down menu on the top left.\r\n3. Select the security group which is obtained from step 1.\r\n4. Click on either ingress or egress tab\r\n5. Try to create a new rule by selecting \"ALL\" from the drop-down list.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2019-12-03 at 10 17 06](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10645273/70037019-1fcd4980-15b6-11ea-9f37-632975960b40.png)\r\n\r\n6. Now get the hostname on which the VM is running and ssh to it.\r\n7. Run the iptables-save command to ensure that the below rule should be applied.\r\n\r\n```\r\n# iptables-save | grep i-2-118-VM\r\n-A i-2-118-VM -s 88.88.88.88/32 -m state --state NEW -j ACCEPT\r\n```\r\n\r\nNew integration test has been added in ```test/integration/component/test_protocol_number_security_group.py```\r\n\r\nIntegration test can be run using\r\n\r\n```nosetests --with-marvin --marvin-config=<config file> test/integration/component/test_protocol_number_security_group.py```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the

Description\r\nFeature specification: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CLOUDSTACK/Private+VLAN+%28PVLAN%29+support+on+Layer+2+networks\r\n\r\n**NOTE: This PR is targeted for Vmware only. Support for XenServer and KVM on future PRs**\r\n\r\nA regular VLAN is a single broadcast domain which is isolated at Layer 2. However, it has two main limitations:\r\n\r\nA switch can have up to a theoretical maximum of 4094 VLANs (as the first and last VLANs are reserved). This maximum number is usually lower, depending on the switch which is used. A traditional isolation solution consists on assigning a VLAN per customer and in some scenarios, this maximum number may not be enough to cover every customer.\r\nIP address management problem: as IP addresses may not be used completely when assigning a subnet per VLAN.\r\nThe private VLAN (PVLAN) architecture tackles these problems providing scalability and IP address management benefits for service providers, as well as Layer 2 security for customers.\r\n\r\nPVLANs partition a VLAN domain into subdomains, these subdomains are represented by a pair: (PRIMARY_VLAN_ID, SECONDARY_VLAN_ID). Every pair in a PVLAN share the PRIMARY_VLAN_ID.\r\n\r\nThere are two types of subdomains: isolated and community subdomains.\r\n\r\nWithin a PVLAN, there are three types of port designations, corresponding to the PVLAN type:\r\n\r\nPromiscuous: An endpoint connected to a promiscuous port can communicate with any endpoint within the PVLAN\r\nIsolated: An endpoint connected to an isolated port can only communicate with endpoints connected to promiscuous ports.\r\nCommunity: An endpoint connected to a community port can communicate with another endpoint in the same community and can also communicate with any promiscuous port but not with other communities.\r\n\r\nThe following table summarizes the communication between different PVLAN types:\r\n\r\n|   | Promiscuous  | Isolated  | Community 1  | Community 2 |\r\n|---|---|---|---|---|\r\n| Promiscuous  | ALLOW  | ALLOW  | ALLOW  | ALLOW  |\r\n| Isolated  | ALLOW  | DENY  | DENY  | DENY  |\r\n| Community 1  | ALLOW  | DENY  | ALLOW  | DENY  |\r\n| Community 2  | ALLOW  | DENY  | DENY  | ALLOW  |\r\n\r\nThe PVLAN support already exists in CloudStack only for Shared networks in Advanced zones. This feature allows extending the PVLAN support to Layer 2 (L2) networks in CloudStack.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\nAs of now provisioning of System VMs with direct download enabled template was not supported. Even after setting such templates as SYSTEM template, while provisioning SSVM and CPVM the server would return an error message like,\r\n\r\n> System vm template is not ready at data center 1, wait until it is ready to launch secondary storage vm\r\n\r\nThis behaviour has been changed and it allows the server to provision SSVM and CPVM even with direct download system templates.\r\nAdditionally, changes have been made to make different timeouts for direct download functionality configurable using global settings. Following global configurations have been added for this,\r\n`direct.download.connect.timeout` - Connection establishment timeout in milliseconds for direct download\r\n`direct.download.socket.timeout` - Socket timeout (SO_TIMEOUT) in milliseconds for direct download\r\n`direct.download.connection.request.timeout` - Requesting a connection from connection manager timeout in milliseconds for direct download\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\n\r\nWhen start a vm or migrate a vm (away from a host in host maintenance), cloudstack will check capacity of all hosts and choose one. If there are hundreds of hosts on the platform, it will take some seconds. When cloudstack choose a host and start/migrate vm to it, the resource consumption of the host might have been changed. This normally happens when we start/migrate multiple vms.\r\nIt would be better to double check the host capacity when start vm on a host.\r\n\r\nThis PR includes the fix for cpucore capacity when start/migrate a vm.\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\n\r\nWhen we calculate a resource consumption of a host, we need to take the vms in following states into calculation: Running, Starting, Stopping, Migrating (to the host), and vms are Migrating from the host. Because, when stop a vm, the resource on host will be released when vm is stopped. When migrate a vm, the resource on destination host will be increased before migration starts, and resource on source host will be decreased after migraiton succeeds. \r\n\r\nIn cloudstack, there is a task named CapacityChecked which run every 5 minutes (capacity.check.period =300000 ms by default). It recalculates capacity of all hosts. However, it takes only vms in Running and Starting into consideration. We have faced some issues in host maintenance due to it.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the issue\r\n(1) migrate N vms from host A to host B, cpu/ram resource increases before the migration.\r\n(2) capacity check recalculate the capacity of hosts. used capacity of Host B will be reset to original value (not including the vms in Migrating).\r\n(3) migrate some more vms from other host to host B, the migrations are allowed by cloudstack (because used capacity is incorrect). If the actual used memory exceed the physical memory on the host, there might be some critical issues (for example, libvirt dies)\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\n\r\nCloudstack, with KVM as a hypervisor, provides live VM snapshots only with volumes whose image format is QCOW. \r\nThis is a limitation for storage providers with disks in RAW format.\r\n\r\nlink to ML: http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/cloudstack-dev/201911.mbox/%3cCAA6FghF7eaY-A3XGN5zSwKVvp7zrcuNzv5nFAQKaF+et3zH-ag@mail.gmail.com%3e#archives\r\n\r\n\r\nWith this feature\r\n- CloudStack users will be able to do live consistent snapshots of all disks attached to the VM \r\n- Is using respective storage provider plugin implementation to take the snapshot\r\n- For NFS/Local storage - now this functionality is limited until #5297 gets merged\r\n- You can create a VM snapshot without its memory\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce? Put an `x` in all the boxes that apply: -->\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [X] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/cloudstack-documentation/pull/153\r\n\r\n## Prerequisites\r\n\r\nguest agent enabled - used to freeze/thaw the VM\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nEnvironment:\r\n\r\n- CloudStack - management and agent version - main\r\n- OS for management and hypervisor - CentOS7\r\n- Hypervisor - KVM\r\n- Primary storages - NFS, StorPool, Local storage and Ceph. \r\n\r\nEnable the global configuration setting - `kvm.vmstoragesnapshot.enabled`\r\n\r\nTake snapshot:\r\n- Take VM snapshot without memory on running virtual

Description\r\n\r\nNew default/bultin templates for major hypervisors:\r\n(new PR, instead of #3710 ) \r\n- CentOS 8.0 (VMware/KVM/XenServer) \r\n- Minimal install with \"standard\" / \"core\" groupinstall (a.k.a. additional network tools - ifconfig, route, etc.)\r\n- nano, iftop, iotop, htop, bash-completion, traceroute\r\n- ssh running, systemctl stop/disable firewalld, SELinux disabled\r\n- disabled \"predictive\" interface names (net.ifnames=0 added to kernel boot line)\r\n- stripped UUID/MAC from eth0 network config file\r\n- VMware: opensource variant \"open-vm-tools\" installed - recommended by VMware (instead of using the one from ESXi hosts); both vmw_pvscsi and vmxnet3 drivers present and details added to vm_template_table to spin VMs with those devices\r\n- XenServer: XenServer Tools 6.5sp1 installed (xs-tools confirmed as running, considering this is CentOS8 which the xs-tools installation script was not aware of)\r\n- KVM: no special configuration, VirtIO present by default\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\nTemplates were deployed on ACS install with old versions of hypervisors: VMware 5.5, XenServer 6.5sp1 fully patched up to patch 1066 and CentOS 7.3 (3 clusters, mixed env) and verified to work on those versions of hypervisors.\r\n\r\nYet to be tested against VMware 6.0/6.5/6.7, XenServer 7.0, 7.1, 7.x and Ubuntu 16/18, CentOS 7.6 maybe - but if it works on older ones than any newer hypervisor should be no problem.\r\n\r\n## Comment:\r\n- The only concern is that XenServer 6.5 must have all the patches installed (confirmed that patch XS65ESP1066 is needed) - otherwise, CentOS 8 (actually, anything newer than CentOS 7.2) will not boot successfully.\r\n","created_at":"2019-11-24T22:58:48Z","updated_at":"2021-10-08T09:46:04Z","closed_at":"2021-10-08T09:46:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d086b64582f9ae4f125a235bede3e26b0612f74e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"rohityadavcloud","id":95203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud","html_url":"https://github.com/rohityadavcloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"kiwiflyer","id":17278194,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3Mjc4MTk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17278194?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiwiflyer","html_url":"https://github.com/kiwiflyer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiwiflyer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiwiflyer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiwiflyer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiwiflyer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiwiflyer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiwiflyer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiwiflyer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiwiflyer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiwiflyer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"nvazquez","id":5295080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyOTUwODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5295080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez","html_url":"https://github.com/nvazquez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"PaulAngus","id":4810220,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MTAyMjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4810220?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PaulAngus","html_url":"https://github.com/PaulAngus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PaulAngus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PaulAngus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PaulAngus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PaulAngus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PaulAngus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PaulAngus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PaulAngus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PaulAngus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PaulAngus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"weizhouapache","id":57355700,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MzU1NzAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57355700?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache","html_url":"https://github.com/weizhouapache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhoua

Description\r\n\r\nNew default/bultin templates for major hypervisors:\r\n\r\n- CentOS 8.0 (VMware/KVM/XenServer) \r\n- Minimal install with \"standard\" / \"core\" groupinstall (a.k.a. additional network tools - ifconfig, route, etc.)\r\n- nano, iftop, iotop, htop, bash-completion, traceroute\r\n- ssh running, systemctl stop/disable firewalld, SELinux disabled\r\n- disabled \"predictive\" interface names (net.ifnames=0 added to kernel boot line)\r\n- stripped UUID/MAC from eth0 network config file\r\n- VMware: opensource variant \"open-vm-tools\" installed - recommended by VMware (instead of using the one from ESXi hosts); both vmw_pvscsi and vmxnet3 drivers present and details added to vm_template_table to spin VMs with those devices\r\n- XenServer: XenServer Tools 6.5sp1 installed (xs-tools confirmed as running, considering this is CentOS8 which the xs-tools installation script was not aware of)\r\n- KVM: no special configuration, VirtIO present by default\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n- [ x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\nTemplates were deployed on ACS install with old versions of hypervisors: VMware 5.5, XenServer 6.5sp1 fully patched up to patch 1066 and CentOS 7.3 (3 clusters, mixed env) and verified to work on those versions of hypervisors.\r\n\r\nYet to be tested against VMware 6.0/6.5/6.7, XenServer 7.0, 7.1, 7.x and Ubuntu 16/18, CentOS 7.6 maybe - but if it works on older ones than any newer hypervisor should be no problem.\r\n\r\n## Comment:\r\n- The only concern is that XenServer 6.5 must have all the patches installed (confirmed that patch XS65ESP1066 is needed) - otherwise, CentOS 8 (actually, anything newer than CentOS 7.2) will not boot

For volumes, we do not have similar operations. When we delete a volume, it will be removed from primary storage permanently.\r\n\r\nWith this change, \r\n(1) we have option to destroy a volume (expunge=false) or delete a volume permanently (expunge=true)\r\n(2) we are be able to recover a Destroy volume to Ready state.\r\n(3) Destroy volume will be removed in storage clean up.\r\n(4) when reinstall a vm, the old root volume will be Destroy state. It can be recovered to Ready state and attached to other vm so we can restore some data.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\n\r\nWhen creating a new disk offering ('createDiskOffering' command on API) one can set _normal_ IOPS (write/read) higher than the maximum, breaking the logics on the disk offerings. Additionally, one can (by mistake) put irrealistic values for the bursting length. Example if adding few zeros by mistake and configuring **360000** seconds, which turns out to be a bursting length of **100** hours.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds verifications ensuring that either Bytes or IOPS bursts cannot be greater than a configured value of the following global settings variables.\r\n\r\n```\r\nvm.disk.bytes.maximum.read.length\r\nvm.disk.bytes.maximum.write.length\r\nvm.disk.iops.maximum.read.length\r\nvm.disk.iops.maximum.write.length\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe default value is 0 (zero), allows any IOPS maximum rate length; thus keeping backward compatibility and not affecting any environment configuration after upgrades.\r\n\r\n# Example:\r\nOne can set the 'vm.disk.bytes.maximum.read.length' to '3600' (seconds); once the parameter is updated on the management server it will not be possible to create disk offerings with IOPS length higher than 3600 seconds (60 minutes).\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\nSpecification document https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CLOUDSTACK/CloudStack+Kubernetes+Service\r\n\r\nKubernetes Service plugin adds Kubernetes integration in the CloudStack. Plugin is disabled by default and an admin can enable it using the Global Setting. It enables users to run containerized services using Kubernetes clusters.\r\n\r\nKubernetes Service plugin uses a CoreOS based template for node VMs for the Kubernetes cluster. For installation of Kubernetes binaries on cluster nodes, a binaries ISO can be created for a particular Kubernetes version and can be added as a supported version by an admin. This allows faster, offline installation Kubernetes binaries and docker images along with support for adding multiple versions of Kubernetes for upgrades and running different clusters.\r\n\r\nFor deployment and setup of Kubernetes on cluster nodes, the plugin uses the Kubernetes tool, kubeadm. kubeadm is the command-line tool for easily provisioning a secure Kubernetes cluster on top of physical or cloud servers or virtual machines. Under the hood, master node(s) of the cluster starts a Kubernetes cluster using kubeadm init command with a custom token and worker nodes join this Kubernetes cluster using kubeadm join command with the same token. More about kubeadm, https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/setup-tools/kubeadm/kubeadm/. Weave Net CNI provider plugin is used for cluster netoworking. More about Weave Net provide plugin, https://www.weave.works/docs/net/latest/kubernetes/kube-addon/.\r\n\r\nTo access Kubernetes dashboard securely, the plugin provides access to kubeconfig file data which allows using the Kubernetes tool, kubectl, to run proxy locally and thereby access dashboard. More about kubectl, https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/\r\n\r\nThe service allows creation of Kubernetes clusters using UI or API. Both UI and API functionalities to list, delete, scale upgrade, stop and start these clusters.\r\n\r\nEnabling the Kubernetes Service\r\n\r\nKubernetes Service plugin is disabled by default. To enable it, go to Global Settings and set the following global configuration to true:\r\n\r\n`cloud.kubernetes.service.enabled`\r\n\r\nRestart the Management Server to enable the set configuration values.\r\n\r\n`service cloudstack-management restart`\r\n\r\nOnce the Kubernetes service is running new API will become accessible and UI will start show Kubernetes Service tab. \r\n\r\n**Kubernetes Supported Versions**\r\nFor faster and offline installation of Kubernetes and docker images on node virtual machines of a Kubernetes cluster, the service provides the functionality to manage supported Kubernetes versions.\r\n\r\nScript named create-kubernetes-binaries-iso.sh has been provided in the cloudstack-common package for creating a new setup iso with the desired version of Kubernetes binaries and corresponding docker images.\r\n\r\nUsage,\r\n\r\n`./create-kubernetes-binaries-iso.sh OUTPUT_PATH KUBERNETES_VERSION CNI_VERSION CRICTL_VERSION WEAVENET_NETWORK_YAML_CONFIG DASHBOARD_YAML_CONFIG`\r\n\r\neg,\r\n\r\n`./create-binaries-iso.sh ./ 1.12.5 0.7.1 1.12.0 \"https://cloud.weave.works/k8s/net?k8s-version=1.12.5\" https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/dashboard/v2.0.0-beta1/aio/deploy/recommended.yaml`\r\n\r\nISOs created using the script can be added as supported Kubernetes version for Kubernetes service.\r\n\r\n_Working with Kubernetes supported version_\r\nNew Kubernetes versions can be added using both UI and API. UI provides the following form to add new supported version,\r\n\r\n`addKubernetesSupportedVersion` API can be used by an admin to add a new supported version for the service. It takes following input parameters,\r\n\r\n```\r\nname (the name of the Kubernetes supported version)\r\nsemanticversion (the semantic version of the Kubernetes; Required)\r\nzoneid (the ID of the zone in which Kubernetes supported version will be available)\r\nisoid (the ID of the binaries ISO for Kubernetes supported version)\r\nurl (the URL of the binaries ISO for Kubernetes supported version)\r\nchecksum (the checksum value of the binaries ISO)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n> add kubernetessupportedversion name=v1.13.2 semanticversion=1.13.2 url=http://172.20.0.1/files/setup-1.13.2.iso zoneid=34d23dd5-5ced-4e8b-9b0a-835a0b8ae2a6\r\n\r\n{\r\n\"kubernetessupportedversion\": {\r\n\"id\": \"6668e999-fe6c-4a91-88d8-d10bcf280d02\",\r\n\"isoid\": \"78d45e9b-a482-46f4-8cbc-cf7964564b85\",\r\n\"isoname\": \"v1.13.2-Kubernetes-Binaries-ISO\",\r\n\"isostate\": \"Active\",\r\n\"semanticversion\": \"1.13.2\",\r\n\"name\": \"v1.13.2\",\r\n\"supportsha\": false,\r\n\"zoneid\": \"34d23dd5-5ced-4e8b-9b0a-835a0b8ae2a6\",\r\n\"zonename\": \"KVM-advzone1\"\r\n}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote:\r\nThe minimum Kubernetes version that can be added in the service is **1.11**.\r\n\r\n`listKubernetesSupportedVersion` API can be used to list existing supported versions. It takes id parameter as input to list details of a single supported version.\r\n\r\n`updateKubernetesSupportedVersion` API has been provided for admins to update an existing supported version to mark them as enabled or disabled.\r\n\r\n`deleteKubernetesSupportedVersion` API has been provided for admins to delete an existing supported version if it is not used by any Kubernetes cluster in the service. id parameter of the API can be used to pass Kubernetes version to be deleted.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n`addKubernetesSupportedVersion`, `updateKubernetesSupportedVersion` and `deleteKubernetesSupportedVersion` API are available to admin only\r\n\r\n**Kubernetes clusters**\r\nKubernetes service provides the functionality of running and managing Kubernetes clusters. Highly available, scalable Kubernetes clusters can be created to run containerized deployments without having trouble to set up Kubernetes on each container node manually. Service will automatically provision the desired number of virtual machines as per cluster size using the binaries from the given Kubernetes version. Additionally, the service provides the functionality to upgrade and scale clusters. Running clusters can be upgraded to a newer minor or patch Kubernetes version at a time. Running clusters can also be scaled for the number of worker nodes up and down and for the service offering used by each node.\r\n\r\nThe provides functionality to create Kubernetes clusters for Shared, Isolated and VPC networks in the CloudStack but such networks must be accessible to CloudStack management server for provisioning virtual machines of the cluster. Template and default network offering must be set Global Settings for the service to create Kubernetes clusters.\r\n\r\nFollowing Global Settings value must be set to the name of Template to be used for deploying node virtual machines while creating a Kubernetes cluster,\r\n\r\n`cloud.kubernetes.cluster.template.name.hyperv`\r\n`cloud.kubernetes.cluster.template.name.kvm`\r\n`cloud.kubernetes.cluster.template.name.vmware`\r\n`cloud.kubernetes.cluster.template.name.xenserver`\r\n\r\nCoreOS templates for CloudStack can be found here, http://dl.openvm.eu/cloudstack/coreos/x86_64/\r\n\r\n> For CoreOS template with VMware, `rootDiskController` should be `pvscsi` and `nicAdapter` should be `Vmxnet3` else root disk resizing might fail apart from some other unexpected behaviours in a cluster deployment.\r\n\r\nFollowing Global Setting value must be set to the name of Network Offering to be used for creating a new network when no network has been selected while creating a Kubernetes cluster,\r\n\r\n`cloud.kubernetes.cluster.network.offering`\r\n\r\nA new network offering named DefaultNetworkOfferingforKubernetesService has been added since 4.14.0\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n\r\n- Multi-master, HA cluster can be created for Kubernetes version 1.16 and above only.\r\n- While creating multi-master, HA cluster over a shared network, an external load-balancer must be manually setup. This load-balancer should have port-forwarding rules for SSH, Kubernetes API server access. Service assumes SSH access to cluster nodes is available from port 2222 to (2222 + cluster node count -1). Similarly, for API access 6443 must be forwarded to master nodes. Over CloudStack isolated network these rules are automatically provisioned.\r\n\r\n_Managing Kubernetes clusters_\r\nFor Kubernetes cluster management, service provides create, stop, start, scale, upgrade and delete APIs and similar features in the UI. APIs available,\r\n`createKubernetesCluster`\r\n```\r\n> create kubernetescluster name=Test description=Test-Cluster zoneid=34d23dd5-5ced-4e8b-9b0a-835a0b8ae2a6 size=1 noderootdisksize=10 serviceofferingid=a4f280a1-9122-40a8-8f0c-3adb91060f2a kubernetesversionid=6668e999-fe6c-4a91-88d8-d10bcf280d02\r\n{\r\n\"kubernetescluster\": {\r\n\"associatednetworkname\": \"Test-network\",\r\n\"cpunumber\": \"4\",\r\n\"description\": \"Test-Cluster\",\r\n\"endpoint\": \"https://172.20.20.12:6443/\",\r\n\"id\": \"74e3cc02-bbf7-438f-bfb0-9c193e90c1fb\",\r\n\"kubernetesversionid\": \"6668e999-fe6c-4a91-88d8-d10bcf280d02\",\r\n\"kubernetesversionname\": \"v1.13.2\",\r\n\"masternodes\": 1,\r\n\"memory\": \"4096\",\r\n\"name\": \"Test\",\r\n\"networkid\": \"148af2cb-4b94-42a2-b701-3b6aa884cbb0\",\r\n\"serviceofferingid\": \"a4f280a1-9122-40a8-8f0c-3adb91060f2a\",\r\n\"serviceofferingname\": \"CKS Instance\",\r\n\"size\": 1,\r\n\"state\": \"Running\",\r\n\"templateid\": \"17607ed6-1756-4ed7-b0f4-dbab5feff5b2\",\r\n\"virtualmachineids\": [\r\n\"da2cb67e-e852-4ecd-b16f-a8f16eb2c962\",\r\n\"4179864a-88ad-4d6d-890c-c9b73c53589b\"\r\n],\r\n\"zoneid\": \"34d23dd5-5ced-4e8b-9b0a-835a0b8ae2a6\",\r\n\"zonename\": \"KVM-advzone1\"\r\n}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`stopKubernetesCluster` can be used to stop a running cluster. It takes id of the cluster as the input parameter.\r\n\r\n`startKubernetesCluster` can be used to start a stopped cluster. It takes id of the cluster as the input parameter.\r\n\r\n`scaleKubernetesCluster` can be used to scale a running or stopped cluster.\r\nNote:\r\nOnly upscaling is supported while scaling clusters for service offering.\r\nOlny a running Kubernetes cluster can be scaled for size.\r\n\r\n`upgradeKubernetesCluster` can be used to upgrade a running cluster.\r\n\r\n`deleteKubernetesCluster` can be used to delete a cluster. It takes id of the cluster as the input parameter.\r\n`getKubernetesClusterConfig` API can be used to retrieve kubeconfig file data for a cluster. It takes id of the cluster as the input parameter.\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

number:50, cidr: 2.2.2.2/32), we expect to have a iptables rule: \"-A ACL_INBOUND_eth2 -s 2.2.2.2/32 -p esp -j ACCEPT\"\r\nthe actual rule is \"-A ACL_INBOUND_eth2 -j DROP\"\r\n\r\nIt is because the rules in json are not correct.\r\nnetwork_acl.json.a8c52dca-0278-4e1c-b72b-987ca7121f4f.gz:{\"device\":\"eth2\",\"mac_address\":\"02:00:7d:27:00:02\",\"private_gateway_acl\":false,\"nic_ip\":\"192.168.11.12\",\"nic_netmask\":\"28\",\"ingress_rules\":[{\"type\":\"protocol\",\"protocol\":50,\"cidr\":\"ACCEPT\",\"allowed\":false},{\"type\":\"all\",\"cidr\":\"0.0.0.0/0\",\"allowed\":true},],\"egress_rules\":[],\"type\":\"networkacl\"}\r\n\r\nFixes:

releases](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-java-client/releases).*\n\n> ## 5.4.0\n> This is a maintenance release with new features and bug fixes. All users of the 5.x.x series are encouraged to use this version.\r\n> \r\n> Note that as of this release, default DNS resolution on the server hostname is disabled when using TLS ([#400](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-java-client/issues/400)). This avoids interfering with hostname verification ([#394](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-java-client/issues/394)). DNS resolution can be easily re-enabled by passing in a `DnsRecordIpAddressResolver` instance to one the `ConnectionFactory#newConnection` methods.\r\n> \r\n> Thanks to [@&#8203;vikinghawk](https://github.com/vikinghawk) for his contribution on this release.\r\n> \r\n> # Changes between 5.3.0 and 5.4.0\r\n> \r\n> ## Make it easier to enable hostname verification when TLS is enabled\r\n> \r\n> GitHub issue: [#394](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-java-client/issues/394) \r\n> \r\n> ## Disable DNS resolution when using TLS\r\n> \r\n> GitHub issue: [#400](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-java-client/issues/400) \r\n> \r\n> ## Add filter to skip some entities on topology recovery\r\n> \r\n> GitHub issue: [#383](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-java-client/issues/383) \r\n> \r\n> ## Add optional retry logic to topology recovery\r\n> \r\n> GitHub issue: [#387](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-java-client/issues/387)\r\n> \r\n> ## Address parser is incapable of handling IPv6 address literals\r\n> \r\n> GitHub issue: [#385](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-java-client/issues/385)\r\n> \r\n> ## Add option for connection recovery triggering\r\n> \r\n> GitHub issue: [#379](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-java-client/issues/379) \r\n> \r\n> ## Continuations (requests) are not discarded on timeouts\r\n> \r\n> GitHub issue: [#375](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-java-client/issues/375) \r\n> \r\n> ## Backport publishing metrics\r\n> \r\n> GitHub issue: [#374](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-java-client/issues/374) \r\n> \r\n> ## Add equals and hashCode to generated classes\r\n> \r\n> GitHub issue: [#377](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-java-client/issues/377) \r\n> \r\n> ## Improve JSON RPC support by using Jackson\r\n> \r\n> GitHub issue: [#378](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-java-client/issues/378) \r\n> \r\n> ## Add dedicated executor to close connections in NIO mode\r\n></tr></table> ...

Description\r\n\r\nIf the volume of a VM is in \"Expunged\" state then it should not be\r\nconsidered towards total resource count of \"primarystoragetotal\"\r\nfield of a domain.\\\r\nCurrently, CloudStack takes into resource calculation even if the\r\nvolume is expunged. The volume itself doesn't exist in primary\r\nstorage and hence it should not be considered towards resource\r\ncalculation.\r\n\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviors, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the issue:\r\n\r\n1 . Get the resource count of \"primarystoragetotal\" of a particular domain.\r\n2 . Create a VM with 5GB root disk size and stop it.\r\n3 . Now the value of \"primarystoragetotal\" should be intitial value plus 5.\r\n4 . Navigate to \"volumes\" of the VM and select \"Download Volume\" option.\r\n5 . Once the volume is downloaded, expunge the VM.\r\n6 . Get the resource count of \"primarystoragetotal\". it will be same value as in step 3\r\n    But it should be same as initial value obtained in step 1.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce? Put an `x` in all the boxes that apply: -->\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds

may add test cases)\r\n\r\n## Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\nThis has been tested using the cloudmonkey api commands.\r\n\r\n```\r\nlist domains id=<ID> filter=primarystorageavailable,primarystoragelimit,primarystoragetotal\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can also run ```update resourcecount domainid=<ID>``` to update the resource before running the above

time set to effectively infinite (36000+ days) since we fully control VM lifecycle via CloudStack.\r\nInfinite time helps avoid some edge cases which could cause DHCPNAK being sent to VMs since\r\n(RHEL) system lose routes when they receive DHCPNAK.\r\nWhen VM is expunged, its active lease and DHCP/DNS config is properly removed (#3627 and #3608) from related files in VR, so the infinite duration of lease does not cause any issues or garbage.\r\nThere will be soon a PR which also regenerates the /var/lib/misc/dnsmasq.leases (active lease DB file) in the new VR (when restarting network with cleanup), which will help around RHEL edge cases (described above) for the VMs who are already running in productions systems with 30d lease time.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Types of

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\nAs the latest docker image in dockerhub is built from master branch, I thought it would be correct to open PR into a master branch (and not to release, if inacceptable, please suggest the correct one).\r\n\r\nFixes: #3397\r\n\r\nThe latest cloudstack/simulator image is not working causing issue #3397. \r\nThe build was incomplete as mysql 5.7 is failing to start during docker build, thus DB is not deployed.\r\nThe command `find /var/lib/mysql -type f -exec touch {} \\;` is a workaround for the issue which causes mysqld 5.7 to crash after start.\r\nPutting VOLUME instruction before starting mysql also solves this problem but does not allow any other changes to the folder during build.\r\n\r\nThere are other also options that might be discussed:\r\n1.

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\n\r\nTested both cases:\r\n- Snapshot backed up on Secondary (stored on primary and secondary) \r\n- Snapshot stored only on primary

\"Xenserver\" strategy handles also Ceph, KVM, and do return `StrategyPriority.DEFAULT` in any case except _REVERT_.\r\n\r\n```\r\n    @Override\r\n    public StrategyPriority canHandle(Snapshot

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\nWe've encountered a corner case where `bridge -o link show` returned two lines per bridge instead of one. `get_bridge_physdev` in `security_group.py` returned `bond0.701\\nbond0.701`.  \r\nAlthough this may very well be something on the hypervisor, we should limit the lines returned.\r\nI therefore added a mere `| head -1` to the function.  \r\n\r\nSee output:  \r\nOld:\r\n```\r\nroot@n02:~# bridge -o link show | awk '/master cloudbr0 / && !/^[0-9]+: vnet/ {print

is supported on arm64 Linux (https://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Processor_support#ARM:). For a small (IoT) platform such as the new Raspberry Pi 4 that uses armv8 processor (cortex-a72) it's possible to run Linux host with `/dev/kvm` accleration.\r\n\r\nThis PR is from a fun weekend project where:\r\n- I set up a Raspberry Pi 4 - 4GB RAM model with 4 CPU cores @ 1.5Ghz, 128GB SD samsung evo plus card\r\n- Installed Ubuntu 19.10 raspi3 base image: http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/19.10/release/ubuntu-19.10-preinstalled-server-arm64+raspi3.img.xz\r\n- Build a custom Linux 5.3 kernel with KVM enabled, deb here: http://dl.rohityadav.cloud/cloudstack-rpi/kernel-19.10/ and install the linux-image and linux-module\r\n- Then install/setup CloudStack on it (fix some issues around jna, by manually installing newer libjna-java to /usr/share/cloudstack-agent/lib)\r\n- Since the host processor is not x86_64, I had to build a new arm64 (or aarch64) systemvmtemplate: http://dl.rohityadav.cloud/cloudstack-rpi/systemvmtemplate/\r\n\r\nI could finally get a 4.13 CloudStack + Adv zone/networking to run on it and deployed a KVM based Ubuntu 19.10 environment and NFS storage. Deployed a test vm with isolated network, VR works as expected. Console proxy works as well, for this tested against arm64 openstack Debian 9/10 templates.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\n\r\nIn advanced zone with security groups, there can be multiple shared networks with security groups enabled. However, it is only possible to create vm with only one network. When we try to create vm with multiple networks, it gives error \"Only support one network per VM if security group enabled\".\r\n\r\nOperations succeed if we create a vm with one network and add other networks to the vm. However, the new nics do not work as there are no network rules for them applied on hypervisor.\r\n\r\nThis PR will enable the functionality on KVM hypervisors, including the support on\r\n(1) API to support vm with multiple networks for KVM\r\n(2) UI to create vm with multiple networks for KVM\r\n(3) network rules applied on all nics (when create a vm, and add/remove nics)\r\n(4) network rules for all secondary ips on all nics\r\n\r\nThis PR includes the other two bug fixes: #3635 and #3636 \r\nThis PR also included a script file for integration test.\r\n\r\nFixes: #3045 #3568 \r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\n\r\nTo Enable UEFI Support for Guest VM's deployed on Hypervisors[ KVM, VMware] in Cloud Stack.\r\n\r\n**Known things.**\r\n\r\n\r\n* UEFI Capability for existing hosts [Vmware, KVM] is not supported, this marked for future enhancement.\r\n*  KVM Host has dependancy on two pre-check conditions 1. OVMF package 2. uefi.properties configured properly or not.\r\n*  Cloud Admin is responsible for updating newly added KVM host(s) with relevant uefi.properties. If mismatch in the config params of uefi.properties , UEFI deploy VM will throw libvirt exception.\r\n* For normal template selected and deployed with UEFI [legacy, secure] options , There won’t be any Exception thrown by Cloud Stack. VM will be in Running state in Cloud Stack, where as actually it’s ended up booting issue’s  on Host due to wrong template/OS deployed to UEFI firmware. Also vice versa also can be happend. This is known behaviour, and uefi enable intelligence can be addressed in the next enhancement when it’s planned. \r\n* Cloud Admin is responsible to prepare Guest VM template which enabled with UEFI support. \r\n* Make sure to deploy a VM manually on Hypervisor and verify UEFI enabled template , prior to on-boarding to CloudStack.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n\r\nRefer below doc for more information.\r\nhttps://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CLOUDSTACK/Enable+UEFI+booting+for+Instance\r\n\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Prepared KVM [ RHEL 8 ] host UEFI enabled by installing OVMF package and configuring libvirt with nvram params\r\n2. Installed cloud stack agent rpm on KVM host. \r\n3. Created & updated uefi.properties configuration file with UEFI params as describe above in \"KVM Host Configuration\".\r\n4. Added KVM Host to a Cluster in Cloud Stack.\r\n5. Prepared & registered 'Windows Server 2016' & 'Cent OS 7.x'  [KVM] templates on to CloudStack. i.e UEFI enabled.\r\n6.

“roundrobin”\r\n•\tindirect.agent.lb.check.interval set to 360 (must be different than 0)\r\n\r\nCase 1:\r\n- Disable a host H\r\n- Restart agent on host H\r\n- Verify that the host is

Description\r\n\r\nFeature Specification: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CLOUDSTACK/%5BKVM%5D+Rolling+Maintenance+of+hosts\r\n\r\nThis feature allows automating the upgrade/patch process of KVM hosts within a zone, pod or cluster by executing custom scripts. \r\n\r\nIn a typical scenario prior this feature, the administrator needed to automate the process of setting hosts in maintenance before performing the upgrade on each host. It is commonly achieved using external automation tools. \r\n\r\nThis feature allows administrators to perform the automation process within CloudStack, providing a flexible framework that allows to define custom scripts to execute on each host. CloudStack executes these scripts within the context of stages. This feature defines 4 stages for a host in the rolling maintenance process: \r\n\r\n- Pre-flight: Pre-flight script will be run on all hosts as part of the pre-flight checks that are carried out before commencing the rolling maintenance. If pre-flight check scripts return an error from any host, then rolling maintenance will be cancelled with no actions taken, and an error returned. If there are no pre-flight scripts defined, then no checks will be done from the hosts. \r\n\r\n- Pre-maintenance: Pre-maintenance script runs 'before' a specific host is put into maintenance. If no pre-maintenance script is defined, or if the pre-flight script on a given host determines no pre-maintenance is required on that host, then no pre-maintenance actions will be done, and the management server will move straight to putting the host in maintenance followed by requesting the agent to run the maintenance script. \r\n\r\n- Maintenance: Maintenance script runs after a host has been put into maintenance. If no maintenance script is defined, or if the pre-flight or pre-maintenance scripts on a given host determine that no maintenance is required on that host, then the host will not be put into maintenance, and the completion of the pre-maintenance scripts will signal the end of all maintenance tasks and the KVM agent will hand the host back to the management server. Once the maintenance scripts have signalled that it have completed, the host agent will signal to the management server that the maintenance tasks have completed, and therefore the host is ready to exit maintenance mode and any 'information' which was collected (such as processing times) will be returned to the management server. \r\n\r\n- Post maintenance: Post-maintenance script is expected to perform validations after the host exits maintenance. These scripts will help to detect any problem during the maintenance process, including reboots or restarts within scripts. \r\n\r\nThe administrator will be responsible for the maintenance and copying of the hook scripts across all KVM hosts. \r\n\r\nOn all the KVM hosts to undergo rolling maintenance, a maintenance hooks directory will be defined in the ‘agent.properties’. \r\n\r\nAdministrators must define only one script per stage. In case a stage does not contain a script, it is skipped, continuing with the next stage. Administrators are responsible for defining and copying scripts into the hosts. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn all the KVM hosts to undergo rolling maintenance, there are two type of scripts execution approaches: \r\n\r\n- Systemd service executor: This approach uses a systemd service to invoke a script execution. Once a script finishes its execution, it will write content to a file, which the agent reads and sends back the result to the management server. \r\n\r\n- Agent executor: The CloudStack agent invokes a script execution within the JVM. In case the agent is stopped or restarted, the management server will assume the stage was completed when the agent reconnects. This approach does not keep the state in a file. \r\n\r\nThe API command to commence rolling maintenance will allow for multiple hosts or clusters or pods or zones to be specified (though each type is mutually exclusive). Before commencing any rolling maintenance actions, pre-flight checks will be run. These fall into two categories: \r\n\r\n- State and capacity and checks on the hosts and clusters to check that a successful run should be possible 'at this time'. \r\n\r\n- The pre-flight scripts on the hosts. Which are created by the admin to check that a successful run should be possible 'at the time' from the context of the specific actions of the scripts. (i.e. checking that each host can access the yum repo) \r\n\r\nIf maintenance scripts have been defined, prior to running any scripts on a host, capacity within the cluster to put the given host into maintenance will be re-checked. If it is found there is not enough capacity in the cluster for that host to successfully go into maintenance, rolling maintenance will immediately stop and an error be output to the logs \r\n\r\nGiven, that compute demands on any cluster are dynamic (i.e. the virtual machines can be started stopped or created at any time), a cluster will be disabled once the prefight checks have been successfully completed, and re-enabled upon the completion of the rolling maintenance on the cluster OR upon a failure during the maintenance of a host to minimise the impact on end users. \r\n\r\n### Management server\r\nA new API method is created to start the automated rolling maintenance process on hosts, ‘startRollingMaintenance’, with the following parameters:\r\n- ‘hostid’, ‘clusterid’, ‘podid’ and ‘zoneid’ are mutually exclusive, and only one of them must be passed.\r\n- ‘forced’: false by default. When enabled, does not stop iterating through hosts in case of any error in the rolling maintenance process.\r\n- ‘timeout’: defines a timeout in seconds for a stage to be completed in a host\r\n- 'payload': extra parameters to be passed as parameters on scripts\r\n\r\n### KVM hosts\r\nTwo new properties must be set in the agent.properties file:\r\n\r\n- ‘rolling.maintenance.hooks.dir’: Pointing to the directory in which the custom scripts are defined\r\n- ‘rolling.maintenance.service.executor.disabled’: false by default. When enabled, the service execution is disabled, using the CloudStack agent as the scripts’ executor.\r\n\r\nA new systemctl service is defined to handle scripts’ execution. This service is started by the CloudStack agent when executing a script, allowing to be executed outside of the JVM in which the CloudStack agent runs. With this approach, script execution is not terminated if the CloudStack agent is terminated, as both processes are not related. This service invokes an executor script which simply invokes the custom script in a given path.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing

Description\r\nDocumentation PR: https://github.com/apache/cloudstack-documentation/pull/84\r\nFS Doc: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CLOUDSTACK/VM+Ingestion\r\n\r\nVM ingestion feature allows CloudStack to discover, on-board, import existing VMs in an infra. The feature currently works only for VMware, with a hypervisor agnostic framework which may be extended for KVM and XenServer in future.\r\nTwo new APIs have been added, `listUnmanagedInstances` and `importUnmanagedInstance`.\r\n### listUnmanagedInstances\r\nAPI will list all unmanaged virtual machine for a give cluster. Optionally, name for an existing unmanaged virtual machine can be given to retrieve VM details.\r\n**API request params -** \r\n`clusterid`(UUID of cluster)\r\n`name`(instance name)\r\n**Response -**\r\n`clusterid`\r\n`hostid`\r\n`name`\r\n`osdisplayname`\r\n`memory`\r\n`powerstate`\r\n`cpuCoresPerSocket`\r\n`cpunumber`\r\n`cpuspeed`\r\n`disk`\r\n    - `id`\r\n    - `capacity`\r\n    - `controller`\r\n    - `controllerunit`\r\n    - `imagepath`\r\n    - `position`\r\n`nic`\r\n    - `id`\r\n    - `macaddress`\r\n    - `networkname`\r\n    - `vlanid`\r\n    - `pcislot`\r\n\r\n### importUnmanagedInstance\r\nAPI will import an exisitng unmanaged virtual machine into CloudStack for a given cluster and virtual machine name. Service offering for the VM, disk offerings for volumes and networks for NICs of the VM can be mapped. Some optional parameters like projectid, domainid, hostname, details, etc can also be given. Appropritate networks, service offering and disk offerings need to be present before import and cannot be created on the fly during the API call.\r\n**API request params -** \r\n`clusterid`(UUID of cluster)\r\n`name`(instance name)\r\n`displayname`\r\n`hostname`\r\n`domainid`\r\n`projectid`\r\n`templateid`\r\n`serviceofferingid`\r\n`nicnetworklist`(Map for NIC ID and corresponding Network UUID)\r\n`datadiskofferinglist`(Map for disk ID and corresponding disk offering UUID)\r\n`details`(Map for VM details)\r\n`migrateallowed`(VM and its volumes are allowed to migrate to different host/pool \r\n**Response -** \r\nSame response as that of `deployVirtualMachine` API\r\n\r\nA python based script (scripts/vm/hypervisor/vmware/discover_networks.py) has been created to aid migrations. It leverages VMware’s pyvmomi library (https://github.com/vmware/pyvmomi) and allows listing all networks for a vCenter host or cluster.\r\n\r\nThis script can take following arguments,\r\n```\r\n-h, --help show this help message and exit\r\n-s HOST, --host HOST vSphere service to connect to\r\n-o PORT, --port PORT Port to connect on\r\n-u USER, --user USER User name to use\r\n-p PASSWORD, --password PASSWORD Password to use\r\n-c CLUSTER, --cluster CLUSTER Cluster for which discover networks\r\n-S, --disable_ssl_verification Disable ssl host certificate verification\r\n-d, --debug Debug log messages\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Been Tested?\r\n<!-- Please describe in detail how you tested your changes. -->\r\n<!-- Include details of your testing environment, and the tests you ran to -->\r\n<!-- see how your change affects other areas of the code, etc. -->\r\n\r\n- A VMware added to running CloudStack with multiple hosts.\r\n- A new vitrual machine deployed from VMware vCenter with multiple disks, networks in the cluster.\r\n- At this point CloudStack does not show or control newly deployed virtual machine.\r\n- `listUnmanagedInstances` API is executed for the cluster. It shows newly deployed VM (deployed from vCenter)\r\n- Import API, `importUnmanagedInstance`, is executed, with appropriate service offering, network- VM NIC details and custom disk offerings for this unmanaged VM\r\n- On successful completion of import API, UI is verified showing imported VM. `listVirtualMachines` API is called to verify showing new VM and `cloud` database is checked for containing new records in `vm_instance`, `volumes`, `nics` tables.\r\n- Lifecycle tasks were performed on the imported VM - stop, start, reboot, migrate, attach new disk.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read

Description\r\nFixes issue #3590 by using the last element on the array from the snapshot \"path\" String for retrieving the snapshot id. Additionally, it uses the `volumePath` as the volume id which should always be the correct value. The error raised on issue #3590 was related to the wrong use of variable \"path\" where in some cases had a different set of substrings.\r\n\r\nThe proposed change has been tested and evaluated. The values used for openning the RBD connection and executing the rollback were stable on the tests. Runned rollback on multiple snapshots and could start the VM with the content matching the ROOT reverted snapshot.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\n\r\nWe noticed that VMs that are target of a static nat cannot use private gateways.\r\n\r\nInvestigation showed that these VMs behave differently than all other VMs in a VPC because their whole traffic gets marked and is only allowed to leave through the public ip provided by the static nat.\r\n\r\nCould be related to: https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/3366\r\nMaybe @richardlawley @rhtyd can contribute if this is an unwanted side-effect.\r\n\r\nTo not break anything we propose a solution that does only mark the nat portion of the traffic and allow the VM use the private gateway like normal.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\nThis proposal allows Virtual Routers to be deployed on disabled zones/pods/clusters. It also gives the opportunity to deploy Admin VMs to be deployed on disabled resources.\r\n\r\nThe default configuration is set to **false** for deploying Admin VMs on disabled resources and deploying system VMs on disabled resources. Both, `allow.router.on.disabled.resources` and `allow.admin.vm.on.disabled.resources`, are configurable and do not require management server restart when updated.\r\n\r\nThe main goal of this implementation is to give flexibility and total control for system admins to decide either if they want or not to deploy System and/or Admin VMs in disabled resources. This implementation was encouraged after an issue related with a disabled Pod; it was not possible to reset networks in the Zone due to the fact that the VRs running on the disabled Pods would fail to be re-deployed.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\nVrouter in redundant mode actually acquire guest ips in a tier in a random mode.\r\nThis is painful when you use terraform or other systems to acquire specific IP because vrouter can take the one selected.\r\n\r\nIt looks like a bug more than an intended behaviour.\r\n\r\nWith this PR vrouter in redundant mode will now take first available ips in the tier which can be predicted\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n- [ ] Breaking change \r\n- [ ] New feature\r\n- [x] Bug fix\r\n- [x] Enhancement\r\n- [ ] Cleanup\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\nThis is tested against production which works great.\r\nThere is no unit test as it looks like there is no in this part of the code, it also not breaking anything and can be considered as a bug

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\n\r\nActually, by default, Cloudstack uses **LSI Logic Parallel** Disk controllers and **E1000** network adapter. Since Mac OS seems to present some compatibility issues (above 10.12) with this default hardware profile, we now set up by default only **one SATA Disk controller** and **E1000E** network adapter (which are compatibles with last versions of Mac OS).\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

want to support more exhaustive health checks for VRs. This feature helps admins configuring health checks and also expands it's scope. There are two categories of health checks - basic and advanced (more expensive so should be run less frequently). The following checks have been added with a separate script - \r\n1. Services check (as per existing monitorServices.py) - basic check\r\n2. Disk space check against a threshold - basic check\r\n3. CPU usage check against a threshold - basic check\r\n4. Memory usage check against a threshold - basic check\r\n5. Router template and scripts version check - basic\r\n6. Connectivity to the gateways from router - basic\r\n7. DNS config match against MS - advanced check\r\n8. DHCP config match against MS - advanced check\r\n9. HA Proxy config match against MS (internal LB and public LB) - advance check\r\n10. Port forwarding match against MS in iptables. - advance check\r\n\r\nFollowing global configs   were added for configuring health checks:\r\n•\t\"router.health.checks.enabled\" - If true, router health checks are allowed to be executed and read. If false, all scheduled checks and API calls for on demand checks are disabled. Default is true.\r\n•\t\"router.health.checks.basic.interval\" - Interval in minutes at which basic router health checks are performed. If set to 0, no tests are scheduled. Default is 3 mins as per the existing monitor services.  \r\n•\t\"router.health.checks.advanced.interval\" - Interval in minutes at which advanced router health checks are performed. If set to 0, no tests are scheduled. Default value is 10 minutes  . \r\n•\t\"router.health.checks.config  .refresh.interval\" - Interval in minutes at which router health checks config - such as scheduling intervals, excluded checks, etc is updated on virtual routers by the management server. This value should be sufficiently high (like 2x) from the router.health.checks.basic.interval and router.health.checks.advanced.interval so that there is time between new results generation for passed data. Default is 10 mins.  \r\n•\t\"router.health.checks.results.fetch.interval\"  - Interval in minutes at which router health checks results are fetched by management server. On each result fetch, management server evaluates need to recreate VR as per configuration of router.health.checks.failures.to.recreate.vr. This value should be sufficiently high (like 2x) from the router.health.checks.basic.interval and router.health.checks.advanced.interval so that there is time between new results generation and fetch.\r\n•\t\"router.health.checks.failures.to.recreate.vr\" - Health checks failures defined by this config are the checks that should cause router recreation. If empty the recreate is not attempted for any health check failure. Possible values are comma separated script names from systemvm’s /root/health_scripts/ (namely - cpu_usage_check.py, dhcp_check.py, disk_space_check.py, dns_check.py, gateways_check.py, haproxy_check.py, iptables_check.py, memory_usage_check.py, router_version_check.py), connectivity.test or services (namely - loadbalancing.service,  webserver.service,  dhcp.service)\r\n•\t\"router.health.checks.to.exclude\" - Health checks that should be excluded when executing scheduled checks on the router. This can be a comma separated list of script names placed in the '/root/health_checks/' folder. Currently the following scripts are placed in default systemvm template -  cpu_usage_check.py, disk_space_check.py, gateways_check.py, iptables_check.py, router_version_check.py, dhcp_check.py, dns_check.py, haproxy_check.py, memory_usage_check.py. \r\n•\t\"router.health.checks.free.disk.space.threshold\" - Free disk space threshold (in MB) on VR below which the check is considered a failure. Default is 100MB.  \r\n•\t\"router.health.checks.max.cpu.usage.threshold\" - Max CPU Usage threshold as % above which check is considered a failure. \r\n•\t\"router.health.checks.max.memory.usage.threshold\" - Max Memory Usage threshold as % above which check is considered a failure. \r\n\r\n\r\nAPI Changes: \r\n* listRouters and listInternalLoadBalancers now optionally takes in a flag includehealthcheckresults (default false) to fetch the last health check results for the router.\r\n* getRouterHealthCheckResults - a new API is added to fetch health check results with an optional flag performfreshchecks to execute checks on demand. This execution is only disabled if \"router.health.checks.enabled\" is false.  performfreshchecks = true means all data from Management server is sent to the router and fresh checks are executed. If false, we retrieve the previously executed result from router itself.\r\n\r\nAdditionally the feature looks into any executable script in /root/health_scripts/ directory and adds it's result as json output of the overall health checks config. This allows custom checks to be put in and custom systemvm templates can also support health checks.\r\n\r\nUI shows router in alert state if health checks are failure.\r\n\r\nThe health checks can be manually triggered using new API added in the feature (CLI or UI both support this).\r\n## Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\nFixes: 3270\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?
