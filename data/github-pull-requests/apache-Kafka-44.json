That PR fixed a similar race condition (only between log flush and log delete) by swallowing `NoSuchFileException`, to avoid the log dir becoming offline. That was a correct fix for the race condition between log flush and log delete, but is not enough to fix the race condition between log flush and log rename ([after dir flush fails, we can lose messages from new segments, if broker fails](https://github.com/apache/kafka/commit/db3e5e2c0de367ffcfe4078359d6d208ba722581)).\r\n\r\nSince both log delete and log alter reached the race condition with log flush through log rename dir, this PR fixes the race condition for both, by synchronizing log flush and log rename dir on the same lock in `UnifiedLog`. More detailed:\r\n1. call to `localLog.flush` was moved under the synchronized block\r\n2. call to `Utils.flushDirIfExists` was replaced with call to `Utils.flushDir`, since swallowing `NoSuchFileException` is no longer required if race condition is addressed with 1\r\n3. `Utils.flushDirIfExists` is removed, since it is no longer used\r\n4. Unit test simulating concurrent dir rename is removed, since it can no longer happen after addressing with 1\r\n\r\nDecided to lock the entire `localLog.flush` call instead of separating the segment flush part from the dir flush part (in `LocalLog`), and locking only the dir flush (in `UnifiedLog`, if call to segment flush returned a boolean for new segments flushed), as the logic was losing cohesion, without much added benefit.\r\n\r\nFor details on the race condition, including code references, please see the description of https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-15572 and comments.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nThis fix was tested by deploying trunk + patch of this PR to one of our staging clusters and running alter replica log dir on 1.5TB of data across 33863 replica log dirs.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [x] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [x] Verify documentation

bad test setup. We tried to fix an upgrade bug for FK-joins in 3.1 release, but it later turned out that the PR was not sufficient to fix it. We finally fixed in 3.4 release.\r\n\r\nThis PR updates the system test matrix to only test working versions with FK-joins. As we don't have added system test to upgrade from 3.4 and 3.5 yet (PR in progress: https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/13860) we don't have any test run with FK-joins in this PR. PR 13860 will need to add those versions to close the gap.\r\n\r\nThis PR also disables the new state-updater-thread that still seems to be buggy crashing system tests.\r\n\r\nThis PR should be

[KIP-976](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-976%3A+Cluster-wide+dynamic+log+adjustment+for+Kafka+Connect)\r\n\r\nAdds a new `scope` URL query parameter to the existing `PUT /admin/loggers/{logger}` endpoint, which accepts values of `worker` (default, modifies logging levels for the worker that receives the request) and `cluster` (modifies logging levels for all workers in the cluster).\r\n\r\nIn addition, adds a new `last_modified` field to the responses from the `GET /admin/loggers` and `GET /admin/loggers/{logger}` endpoints, which contains the Unix epoch (in milliseconds) for when the logger was last modified (or null, if no dynamic modifications have taken place).\r\n\r\nUnit, integration, and system tests are included, as detailed in the KIP's [test plan](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-976%3A+Cluster-wide+dynamic+log+adjustment+for+Kafka+Connect#KIP976:ClusterwidedynamiclogadjustmentforKafkaConnect-TestPlan).\r\n\r\nThis PR is divided into three commits:\r\n- Functional changes and unit tests\r\n- Integration tests (which includes adding support for running embedded standalone workers)\r\n- System tests\r\n\r\nEach can be reviewed separately, but they are included together in this PR in order to simplify iteration as it's possible (likely, even) that addressing review comments made on one commit will require changes to be made for files touched on in another commit. But if it makes life easier for reviewers, I'm happy to break this down into three separate PRs.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

users complained they don't have a way to determine if there is something wrong in the RSM plug-in they implemented, or there's something wrong in Kafka itself. Also, if there are users who just want to try the tiered storage feature out before implementing anything, it would be good we have an RSM implementation by default. \r\n\r\nPer the discussion in the KIP, there will be no default RSM implementation in Kafka, but we can use the `LocalTieredStorage` implemented for integration test, to resolve the issues above.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/kafka/assets/43372967/52435eb0-28f4-448a-8a86-f4069f931472)\r\n\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/kafka/assets/43372967/e90ddf95-6d60-462c-bbbf-95ada1b97f6b)\r\n\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/kafka/assets/43372967/80f96030-a36c-4110-9b41-c6126a75db6f)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n###

Update test and add test cases in IQv2StoreIntegrationTest.\r\n- Originally, all key-value pairs were confined to a single window, with all data added at WINDOW_START. To improve our testing, we've expanded to multiple windows.\r\n- With a total of 10 records, keys ranging from 0 to 4 determine the designated partition for each message, either 0 or 1. Each consecutive pair of records, such as <0,0> and <0,1> or <1,2> and <1,3>, shares the same key. For instance, both <0,0> and <0,1> are directed to partition 0 due to their shared key '0', while pairs like <1,2> and <1,3>, having the key '1', are sent to partition 1. This pattern is consistent across all records.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-15570\r\n- Currently, the [MemoryConfigBackingStore](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/6e164bb9ace3ea7a1a9542904d1a01c9fd3a1b48/connect/runtime/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/connect/storage/MemoryConfigBackingStore.java#L37) class doesn't have any unit tests for its functionality.\r\n- While most of its functionality is fairly lightweight today, changes will be introduced with [KIP-980](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-980%3A+Allow+creating+connectors+in+a+stopped+state) (potentially [KIP-976](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-976%3A+Cluster-wide+dynamic+log+adjustment+for+Kafka+Connect) as well) and it would be good to have some basic tests in place before those changes are made.\r\n- This also makes it easier to introduce additional tests for newer functionality without having to add the irrelevant scaffolding then.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-15567\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\n- Currently, ReplicaFetcherThreadBenchmark doesn't run due to 2 reasons:\r\n  * NPE that is introduced by https://github.com/apache/kafka/commit/755e04a41dfd00dd4587b0fe0980befd0ae5c433\r\n      - ZkMetadataCache instantiation causes NPE because we pass `null` for `kraftControllerNodes` but it should be `Seq.empty`\r\n  * NotLeaderOrFollowerException that is introduced by https://github.com/apache/kafka/commit/3467036e017adc3ac0919bbc0c067b1bb1b621f3\r\n      - Even we address above NPE issue, we still get NotLeaderOrFollowerException\r\n      - ```\r\n        org.apache.kafka.common.errors.NotLeaderOrFollowerException: Error while fetching partition state for topic-30\r\n        ```\r\n      - This is because replicaManager doesn't host partitions when RemoteLeaderEndPoint tries to build fetches\r\n- This PR addresses these problems\r\n- NPE issue on ZkMetadataCache instantiation also occurs in other several benchmarks. This PR also fix these benchmarks.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation\r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2023-10-09T15:02:27Z","updated_at":"2025-01-03T03:38:01Z","closed_at":"2025-01-03T03:38:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":5604089486,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABTgeejg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":"Stale

Besides active running tasks, Kafka Streams tries to commit restoring active tasks and standby tasks. However, restoring active tasks do not need to be committed since they do not have offsets to commit and the current code does not write a checkpoint. Furthermore, trying to commit restoring active tasks with the state updater enabled results in the following error:\r\n\r\njava.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: This task is read-only at org.apache.kafka.streams.processor.internals.ReadOnlyTask.commitNeeded(ReadOnlyTask.java:209) ...\r\n\r\nsince commitNeeded() is not a read-only method for active tasks.\r\n\r\nIn future, we can consider writing a checkpoint for active restoring tasks in this situation.

Even in the case of leader epoch bumps, we may be electing the same leader. In that case, we don't need to do some operations (load state from disk that is already loaded). The GroupCoordinator already handles this case, but the transaction coordinator does not. I've updated this code to not read from disk, but to take the existing metadata and update the leader epoch, as well as send markers with the new epoch.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from

PR fixes the concurrency bug in RemoteIndexCache.\r\n\r\n(From Jira description)\r\nRemoteIndexCache has a concurrency bug which leads to IOException while fetching data from remote tier.\r\n\r\nBelow events in order of timeline -\r\n\r\n- Thread 1 (cache thread): invalidates the entry, removalListener is invoked async, so the files have not been renamed to \"deleted\" suffix yet.\r\n- Thread 2: (fetch thread): tries to find entry in cache, doesn't find it because it has been removed by 1, fetches the entry from S3, writes it to existing file (using replace existing)\r\n- Thread 1: async removalListener is invoked, acquires a lock on old entry (which has been removed from cache), it renames the file to \"deleted\" and starts deleting it\r\n- Thread 2: Tries to create in-memory/mmapped index, but doesn't find the file and hence, creates a new file of size 2GB in AbstractIndex constructor. JVM returns an error as it won't allow creation of 2GB random access file.\r\n\r\n**Fix**: Used `EvictionListener` instead of `RemovalListener` to perform the eviction synchronously in Caffeine cache and for the manual removal used computeIfAbsent to rename and delete the key from the cache synchronously by returning null.\r\n\r\nAdded `testConcurrentRemoveReadForCache` to reproduce the bug by following the above timeline of events. Unit test case is passing now.\r\n\r\nJira\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-15481\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation

**Test Cases Covered** \r\n\r\n1. **Index Files already exist on disk but not in Cache** i.e. RemoteIndexCache should not call  remoteStorageManager to fetch it instead cache it from the local index file present.\r\n2. **RSM returns CorruptedIndex File**  i.e. RemoteIndexCache should throw CorruptedIndexException instead of successfull execution. \r\n3. **Deleted Suffix Indexes file already present on disk**  i.e. If cleaner thread is slow , then there is a chance of deleted index files present on the disk while in parallel same index Entry is invalidated.

Summary\r\nUpdate an implementation of the Query interface, introduced in [KIP-796: Interactive Query v2](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-796%3A+Interactive+Query+v2) , to support reverseRange and reverseAll. Use bounded query to achieve reverseRange and use unbounded query to achieve reverseAll. \r\nTo achieve reverseRange and reverseAll, we add new flag variable reverse in RangeQuery class, to help us to do the rangeQuery or reverseQuery.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Test plan\r\nThis time, we aim to implement reverseRange and reverseAll. To ensure the accuracy of the results for both, modifications to IQv2StoreIntegrationTest  are necessary. Previously, we stored query results in a set, which doesn't retain order. I've since switched to using a list to store the query results. This allows us to discern the differences between rangeQuery and reverseQuery.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

`LogAppendInfo` class is a bit bloated in terms of class fields. That's because it is used as an umbrella class for both leader log appends and follower log appends and needs to carry fields for both. This makes the constructor for the class a bit cludgy to use. It also ends up being a bit confusing when fields are important and when they aren't. I noticed there were a few fields that didn't seem necessary.\r\n\r\nBelow is a description of changes:\r\n- `firstOffset` is a `LogOffsetMetadata` but there are no readers of the field that use anything but the `messageOffset` field - simplified to a long.\r\n- `LogAppendInfo.errorMessage` is only set in one context - when calling `LogAppendInfo.unknownLogAppendInfoWithAdditionalInfo`. When we use this constructor, we pass up the original exception in `LogAppendResult` anyway, so the field is redundant with the `LogAppendResult.exception` field. This allows us to simplify the handling in #14378 since there are no custom error messages we just return whatever is in the exception message.\r\n- We only use `targetCompressionType` when constructing the `LogValidator` - just inline the call instead of including it in the LogAppendInfo.\r\n- `offsetsMonotonic` is only used when not assigning offsets to throw an exception - just throw the exception instead of setting a field to throw later.\r\n- `shallowCount` is only there to determine whether there are any messages in the append. Instead, we can just check `validBytes` which is incremented with a non-zero value every time we increment `shallowCount`.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2023-10-01T04:15:17Z","updated_at":"2023-10-04T13:38:10Z","closed_at":"2023-10-04T00:32:45Z","merged_at":"2023-10-04T00:32:45Z","merge_commit_sha":"2c925e9f334b0aa6c52df343c2394f00f86ac2ff","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/14470/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/14470/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/14470/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/dd77d3b9b82694f0009085a3013a12a1b515f29a","head":{"label":"splett2:simplify-log-append-info","ref":"simplify-log-append-info","sha":"dd77d3b9b82694f0009085a3013a12a1b515f29a","user":{"login":"splett2","id":47232755,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MjMyNzU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47232755?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/splett2","html_url":"https://github.com/splett2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/splett2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/splett2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/splett2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/splett2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/splett2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/splett2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/splett2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/splett2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/splett2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":239831054,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzk4MzEwNTQ=","name":"kafka","full_name":"splett2/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"splett2","id":47232755,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MjMyNzU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47232755?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/splett2","html_url":"https://github.com/splett2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/splett2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/splett2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/splett2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/splett2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/splett2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/splett2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/splett2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/splett2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/splett2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/splett2/kafka","description":"Mirror

Javadoc for `GroupMetadataManager#throwIfMemberEpochIsInvalid` suggests that it throws a `NotCoordinatorException` exception when the member epoch in the consumer heartbeat request is greater than the one known by this coordinator for the given member. This could happen if the heartbeat-ing member got a higher epoch from another coordinator. However the method throws `FencedMemberEpochException` even in this case.

Streams needs to include the leader epoch when committing offsets.\r\n\r\nLeader epoch is required to detect situations where a consumer with outdated metadata is trying to fetch the committed offset of a partition after being assigned that partition during a rebalance. The committed offset may be for a newer epoch than the consumer has in its metadata, leading to an OFFSET_OUT_OF_RANGE error and possible data loss.\r\n\r\nWithout an extension of the consumer interface, it is not possible to set the correct leader offset in all circumstances. In particular, when we attempt to commit an offset that ends with a batch of control records, the leader offset of the control records are not exposed to Kafka streams. This can happen primarily in EOS mode, whenever Kafka streams' internal record buffers are depleted.\r\n\r\nThis is a partial fix to avoid the situation described above in most cases - with the final fix for EOS still open.\r\n\r\nWhen committing an offset, and our internal record queue is non-empty, we commit the leader offset of the next record in the queue. We extend `StampedRecord`, `RecordQueue`, `RecordDeserializer` and `PartitionGroup` to expose and keep track of leader epochs.\r\n\r\nIf our internal record queue is empty, we commit the position of the consumer. If the position of the consumer happens to be the last consumed offset + 1, we use the last consumed leader epoch in the commit, otherwise, we omit the leader epoch.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist
