Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\n1. Persist external catalog/db/tbl with GSON\r\n\r\n    1. Move idToDb/dbNameToId from EsExternalCatalog/HMSExternalCatalog to their parent class ExternalCatalog\r\n    2. Can't move idToTbl/tableNameToId from EsExternalDatabase/HMSEXTERNALDatabase to their parent class ExternalDatabase,\r\n       because of there interface problem, so I left them there.\r\n    3. Add RuntimeTypeAdapterFactory for db/tbl to GSON_BUILDER, to support inherit serde.\r\n\r\n2. NOTICE\r\n\r\n    the field \"initialized\" in ExternalDatabase/Table has also been serialized to Gson.\r\n    But some of fields, such as \"remoteTable\" in HMSExternalTable is null, and it depends on \"initialized\" to init it.\r\n    We need to modify there logic. And I think the \"remoteTable\" can be initialized lazily.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n3. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n4. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n5. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n6. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #13738\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nSplits a string into substrings separated by a string. It uses a constant string separator of muliple characters as the separator. If the string separator is empty,  it will split the string s into an array of single characters.\r\n\r\n## Syntax\r\n\r\nsplitByString(s, separator)\r\n\r\n## Arguments\r\n\r\nseparator — The separator.[String]\r\ns — The string to split. [String]\r\n\r\n## Returned value(s)\r\n\r\nReturns an array of selected substrings. Empty substrings may be selected when:\r\nType: Array(String).\r\nA non-empty separator occurs at the beginning or end of the string;\r\nThere are multiple consecutive non-empty separators;\r\nThe original string s is empty while the separator is not empty.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n2. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [x] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n3. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [x] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n4. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n5. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [x] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-10-27T12:04:16Z","updated_at":"2022-12-12T07:22:30Z","closed_at":"2022-12-12T07:22:30Z","merged_at":"2022-12-12T07:22:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"38570312dd0f92ec21c65a3f05becab123e96ad7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1693771265,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjkzNzcxMjY1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/kind/docs","name":"kind/docs","color":"c7def8","default":false,"description":"Categorizes

Proposed changes\r\n\r\n~~Issue Number: close #xxx~~\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nThere are some issues with the compile flag `-Wno-unused-but-set-variable` for clang.\r\n1. `-Wno-unused-but-set-variable` should be set when building source by clang-15 on Linux. (#13000 #13016)\r\n2. On macOS Monterey, Apple Clang 13 may treat it as a unknown warning option and the compilation process may interrupt.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a better way to make this compile flag more portable.\r\n1. Test whether the compiler recognizes this flag.\r\n2. Add this flag if the compiler recognizes it.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n4. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [x] No Need\r\n5. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [x] No Need\r\n6. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n7. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [x] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-10-27T03:22:49Z","updated_at":"2022-10-27T07:18:31Z","closed_at":"2022-10-27T07:18:28Z","merged_at":"2022-10-27T07:18:28Z","merge_commit_sha":"bad950136dcdfd431ef9ccdb8331b19d5213493b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2039763841,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDM5NzYzODQx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/approved","name":"approved","color":"00ff00","default":false,"description":"Indicates

Proposed changes\r\n\r\n~~Issue Number: close #xxx~~\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nPreviously, there are some issues with BE (built with Java UDF support) on macOS and we disable it by default (#13563).\r\n\r\nNow, all issues are resolved.\r\n1. `ulimit -n` doesn't work.\r\n    **Root cause**\r\n    `RLIMIT_NOFILE` will be assigned the minimum of `OPEN_MAX (10240)` and `rlim_cur` when create a Java VM.\r\n    \r\n    **openjdk (tag: jdk-11+16)**\r\n    _src/hotspot/os/bsd/os_bsd.cpp_\r\n    ```cpp\r\n    jint os::init_2(void) {\r\n    \r\n      os::Posix::init_2();\r\n    \r\n      // initialize suspend/resume support - must do this before signal_sets_init()\r\n      if (SR_initialize() != 0) {\r\n        perror(\"SR_initialize failed\");\r\n        return JNI_ERR;\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n      Bsd::signal_sets_init();\r\n      Bsd::install_signal_handlers();\r\n      // Initialize data for jdk.internal.misc.Signal\r\n      if (!ReduceSignalUsage) {\r\n        jdk_misc_signal_init();\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n      // Check and sets minimum stack sizes against command line options\r\n      if (Posix::set_minimum_stack_sizes() == JNI_ERR) {\r\n        return JNI_ERR;\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n      if (MaxFDLimit) {\r\n        // set the number of file descriptors to max. print out error\r\n        // if getrlimit/setrlimit fails but continue regardless.\r\n        struct rlimit nbr_files;\r\n        int status = getrlimit(RLIMIT_NOFILE, &nbr_files);\r\n        if (status != 0) {\r\n          log_info(os)(\"os::init_2 getrlimit failed: %s\", os::strerror(errno));\r\n        } else {\r\n          nbr_files.rlim_cur = nbr_files.rlim_max;\r\n    \r\n    #ifdef __APPLE__\r\n          // Darwin returns RLIM_INFINITY for rlim_max, but fails with EINVAL if\r\n          // you attempt to use RLIM_INFINITY. As per setrlimit(2), OPEN_MAX must\r\n          // be used instead\r\n          nbr_files.rlim_cur = MIN(OPEN_MAX, nbr_files.rlim_cur);\r\n    #endif\r\n    \r\n          status = setrlimit(RLIMIT_NOFILE, &nbr_files);\r\n          if (status != 0) {\r\n            log_info(os)(\"os::init_2 setrlimit failed: %s\", os::strerror(errno));\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    ...\r\n    ```\r\n    Here `MaxFDLimit` is true by default.\r\n\r\n    **Solution**\r\n    Disable `MaxFDLimit` on macOS.\r\n2. Core dump when using lldb to debug.\r\n    Environment variable `DORIS_JNI_CLASSPATH_PARAMETER` should be set before BE starts and BE use this variable to get the classpath needed by JVM.\r\n    We can provide a workaround. If `DORIS_JNI_CLASSPATH_PARAMETER` is unset, we scan the `${DORIS_HOME}/lib` to get the jars and produce the classpath.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n4. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [x] No Need\r\n5. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [x] No Need\r\n6. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n7. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [x] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered,

feature mainly handle compaction for ordered data, adding a min_max key for segment and check if rowset are non-overlapping so we can do compaction just move files and modify rowset meta instead of traverse all rows.\r\n\r\nThe strategy list below:\r\n1. more than half of rowsets are non overlapping.\r\n2. all segments are more than 10M\r\n3. if base compaction, no delete version contains in

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nPR(https://github.com/apache/doris/pull/13404) introduced that ParquetReader will break up batch insertion when encountering null values, which leads to the bad performance

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nWhen running regression test, we always found that the query return empty result after loading finished,\r\neven if we call \"sync\" before the query.\r\nThis is because for `stream load`, the load task result will be returned immediately after the txn's status changed to VISIBLE,\r\nbut before writing the edit log.\r\nSo if we do the query right after we got the load task result, it is possible that we can not see the latest loaded data.\r\n\r\nSame issue with `insert` operation\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n2. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [x] No Need\r\n3. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [x] No Need\r\n4. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n5. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [x] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-10-26T07:21:48Z","updated_at":"2022-10-27T01:47:18Z","closed_at":"2022-10-27T01:47:18Z","merged_at":"2022-10-27T01:47:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"7557980d64af257be917fd43821bf02028e6afc3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1817282214,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxODE3MjgyMjE0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/kind/test","name":"kind/test","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2039763841,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDM5NzYzODQx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/approved","name":"approved","color":"00ff00","default":false,"description":"Indicates

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nLoad libjvm at runtime.\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nCurrently, we build BE with Java UDF support by default. Unlike other dependencies which are linked with BE statically, we link BE and libjvm dynamically. As a result, we should set the environment variable `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` before we start BE up, otherwise we will get an error (error while loading shared libraries). That is really inconvenient.\r\n\r\nThe workaround is that we can load the libjvm at runtime.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n2. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [x] No Need\r\n3. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [x] No Need\r\n4. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n5. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [x] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-10-25T14:42:21Z","updated_at":"2022-10-28T02:09:54Z","closed_at":"2022-10-28T00:45:13Z","merged_at":"2022-10-28T00:45:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"2ef8f3f6f42e5dabc650049dd66fcf6a1e7befe2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2039763841,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDM5NzYzODQx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/approved","name":"approved","color":"00ff00","default":false,"description":"Indicates
