we run all integration tests in CI together on self-hosted runners they are somewhat flaky, however when those tests are run individually on public runners, they are both fast and stable. Also the integration test list has been somewhat duplicated - you had to remember about adding individual integration tests to the separate integration-tests workflow when you added such integration tests.\r\n\r\nThis PR solves all those problems:\r\n\r\n* we always run integration tests individually\r\n* they are all run on public runners no matter what build they are on\r\n* they are run as matrix of jobs and list of tests is extracted via selective checks outputs - no more duplication\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

a warning message to KPO to warn of one second interval logs duplication.\r\n\r\nThe KubernetesPodOperator is duplicating the last one second logs when a pod is interrupted, and this is because the logs reading method in the Kubernetes python client takes a since_seconds parameter, and doesn't support passing a finer-grained time representation (See [here](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/python/issues/1351) for context). The optimal fix requires a change in Kubernetes Python client.\r\nAs a quick win, we added a warning message to warn users that logs that the last second logs before the container was interrupted

you have localy umask set to 077 or similar (disallowing group access), the PROD image used to run k8s tests was not working properly. The files copied to k8s image when preparing k8s image for local testing were copied using `root` user. This worked with no problems when group read access was set (umask 022 or 002 is usually set by defailt). But when someone had umask set to disable group read access when checking out the repository (077 or similar) then the files copied to the K8s image had no group read access and airflow failed with strange \"import error\".\r\n\r\nThis PR adds `--chown airflow:0` to all files copied when k8s image is prepared and makes sure that airflow user is set by default. This should work regardless of the umask setting (as long as the host owner has read access to checked out repository).\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

we pass a task over RPC call we can't include the dag as part of the task without running into recursion trouble.  So we just \"elide\" the dag from the task object, require that it be passed separately and then get reattatched to the task after deserialization.  We introduce a sentinel so that way we can raise a helpful error if someone tries to access the dag attr after it's been elided.  Additionally, the sentinel lets us short circuit some logic in the task.dag setter that is not helpful.\r\n\r\nThe motivator for this PR is avoiding conditional code like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    # when taking task over RPC, we need to add the dag back\r\n    if isinstance(task, MappedOperator):\r\n        if not task.dag:\r\n            task.dag = dag\r\n    elif not task._dag:\r\n        task._dag = dag\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the idea for this approach came from a discussion with @uranusjr .\r\n\r\nThe addition of method `get_relevant_upstream_map_indexes` to the pydantic TI model is just a driveby addition and i can split it out if necessary.\r\n","created_at":"2024-05-24T21:22:13Z","updated_at":"2024-07-12T11:18:23Z","closed_at":"2024-07-10T22:23:34Z","merged_at":"2024-07-10T22:23:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"7d7a4cdf0af00c7f3bd1b46e8ad68c65c7e0265b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"uranusjr","id":605277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTI3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/605277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr","html_url":"https://github.com/uranusjr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"bolkedebruin","id":4282712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4282712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin","html_url":"https://github.com/bolkedebruin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1769805151,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzY5ODA1MTUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/

Fix: Increment try_number/poke_count in BaseSensorOperator for correct exponential backoff in reschedule mode.\r\n\r\nWhat happened?\r\n- The `BaseSensorOperator` does not correctly implement exponential backoff when in `reschedule` mode.\r\n- The sensor reschedules at a constant interval instead of increasing the interval exponentially.\r\n\r\nWhat you think should happen instead?\r\n- The `try_number` (or `poke_count`) should increment on each reschedule too, ensuring the backoff interval increases exponentially.\r\n\r\nHow to reproduce?\r\n- Set up a `BaseSensorOperator` with `mode=\"reschedule\"` and `exponential_backoff=True`.\r\n- Observe the interval between reschedules; it remains constant instead of increasing exponentially.\r\n\r\n\r\n#6654 \r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n

speed up the checks In CI we run mypy checks in parallel, so we split it by folder rather than by files letting mypy to discover or pass all files.\r\n\r\nThis is done via `manual` stage of the mypy-* checks.\r\n\r\nHowever we have not included / excluded tests in the checks between airflow and providers.\r\n\r\nThis PR should fix the problem where some of the tests might have typing errors and if the user did not run it manually, they could go undetected.\r\n\r\nWe also explicitly exclude all \"providers\" related tests. While the regular providers do not need to be skipped because there was no `--namespace-packages` added as mypy flag, test packages are regular packages and they should be excluded explicitly.\r\n\r\nFinally the command to run is printed in the output of the mypy check.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

It even failed with the following connection settings:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"use_ssl\": \"True\",\r\n  \"verify_certs\": \"False\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThose parameters were converted to strings and not as booleans.\r\n\r\nAnother issue we faced is that the connection type RequestsHttpConnection did not work for us. We discovered it because we knew the Opensearch client itself worked which uses by default a Urllib3HttpConnection, but the hook does not. \r\n\r\nThis PR addresses both issues:\r\n-  The parameters use_ssl and verify_certs are both converted to boolean in the hook\r\n- an option is provided to specify an existing Opensearch connection type.

Description\r\n\r\nThis pull request makes this example DAG work. This DAG uses the XComArg (in other words, `.output`) from the first task as the input for the `trigger_dag_id` argument in the `TriggerDagRunOperator`.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# example dag\r\nfrom airflow.models import DAG\r\nfrom airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator\r\nfrom airflow.operators.trigger_dagrun import TriggerDagRunOperator\r\n\r\nwith DAG(\r\n    dag_id=\"trigger_dag\",\r\n    description=\"Tests triggering a dag\",\r\n    catchup=False,\r\n) as dag:\r\n    \r\n    get_dag_id = PythonOperator(\r\n        task_id=\"get_dag_id\",\r\n        python_callable=lambda: \"other_dag\",\r\n    )\r\n\r\n    trigger_dag = TriggerDagRunOperator(\r\n        task_id=\"trigger_other_dag\",\r\n        trigger_dag_id=get_dag_id.output,\r\n    )\r\n    \r\n    get_dag_id >> trigger_dag\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Open Questions\r\n\r\nI left the `or` statement in the `get_link` function of the `TriggerDagRunLink` so that past operator links would still work (ones that were run before this change). However, if you click the operator link too fast, before the `self.trigger_dag_id` is pushed to the XCom, it will use the second value in the `or` statement - which will result in an error message.\r\n\r\nHere is the code piece I'm referencing:\r\nhttps://github.com/nyoungstudios/airflow/blob/4ea12c7283000ad5ae1b736c67fd1d2ed9f747ef/airflow/operators/trigger_dagrun.py#L75-L86\r\n\r\nThis is the error message if you click too fast.\r\n![Screenshot from 2024-05-22 17-20-28](https://github.com/apache/airflow/assets/16254116/e0d2ffcf-6853-44f4-8aa1-578a85b07d52)\r\n\r\nI wrote a workaround in my [last commit](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/39772/commits/4ea12c7283000ad5ae1b736c67fd1d2ed9f747ef) so that we do not see this error message, but I am not much of a fan of how it is implemented. If you have any better ideas on how to do this, let me know.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nTested with both Postgres and SQLite databases.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

pull request introduces the [DatabricksWorkflowTaskGroup](https://github.com/astronomer/astro-provider-databricks/blob/main/src/astro_databricks/operators/workflow.py#L226)\r\nto the Airflow Databricks provider from the [astro-provider-databricks](https://github.com/astronomer/astro-provider-databricks/tree/main)\r\nrepository. \r\nIt marks another pull request aimed at contributing \r\noperators and features from that repository into the Airflow \r\nDatabricks provider, the previous PR being https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/39178.\r\n\r\nThe task group launches a [Databricks Workflow](https://docs.databricks.com/en/workflows/index.html) \r\nand runs the notebook jobs from within it, resulting in a \r\n[75% cost reduction](https://www.databricks.com/product/pricing) ($0.40/DBU for all-purpose compute, \r\n$0.07/DBU for Jobs compute) when compared to executing \r\n``DatabricksNotebookOperator`` outside of ``DatabricksWorkflowTaskGroup``.\r\n\r\nThere are a few advantages to defining your Databricks Workflows in Airflow:\r\n\r\n|                                      |        via Databricks         |

There's no `setup_method` for connection with an external service; everything is nicely mocked, and they run OK on Breeze locally (maybe a bit slow, but that's for another time)...why leave them out? :)\r\nThis PR relocates the unit tests back to their original directory, and also fixes a path in the `test_project_structure.py` (the original paths for the unit tests above were left in this file as is).\r\nAlso, `test_bigquery_to_mssql.py` was duplicated in the original path and in the providers' integration tests - I assume that by mistake or as a blueprint for the integration tests, but for now it's better be deleted to avoid confusion.\r\n\r\ncc: @potiuk, @Taragolis\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nRead the

issue with OpenLineage in FileTransferOperator when running Airflow 2.8.\r\n\r\nNamespace property has been added in core Airflow `io.path.ObjectStoragePath` with #36410 (Airflow 2.9) so when running Airflow 2.8 we should re-create this behaviour manually inside the provider based on what was available in 2.8.0\r\n\r\nThere is no need for any action for Airflow <2.8 as the `apache-airflow-providers-common-io` requires at least 2.8.0\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nRead the **[Pull

apache/airflow#38673\r\n\r\nThis PR constains explicit change filter warnings in `AutoMLTablesUpdateDatasetOperator` and `AutoMLDeployModelOperator` by provide `action=\"error\"` into the decorator which looks like an worst practice, because it can't be controlled by the end users.\r\n\r\nIf this functional still exists and users could use it we should not raise an error here, user might want to control it by provide `-W` flag to the interpreter or `PYTHONWARNINGS` env var: see [Warning control](https://docs.python.org/3/library/warnings.html#the-warnings-filter)\r\n\r\nIf this functional not exists we could:\r\n- Just raise a warning, so we would warn end users that this functional not exists\r\n- Explicitly raise `AirflowException` (we do not have appropriate exception, even if we add it it will available in Airflow 2.10+) in constructor (`__init__`) method\r\n\r\nThere is difference `deprecated and `removed`. Deprecated mean this functional still available (even if limited) but removed mean that this functional not available anymore.

Some features were moved to Cloud Translation and Vertex AI, and some just stopped being supported. \r\n\r\nThe AutoML Tables operators are trying to make operations on AutoML datasets, such as getting specs of the tables contained within the datasets or updating the datasets. However after its deprecation, the only available functionality for AutoML is AutoML Translation, which is integrated into Cloud Translation and does not support tabular datasets. So we can query the datasets with the operators, but no tables or their columns will be found, making these operators useless and prone to errors.\r\n\r\nTabular datasets are available in Vertex AI, but unfortunately at this moment only `AutoMLTablesUpdateDatasetOperator` has a substitute  Vertex AI operator with similar functions.  `AutoMLTablesListTableSpecsOperator`  and `AutoMLTablesListColumnSpecsOperator` have no substitutes.\r\n\r\nThe functionality of `AutoMLDeployModelOperator` is also not supported by Cloud AutoML anymore. Instead  the `DeployModelOperator` from Vertex AI should be used.\r\n\r\nThis PR is a continuation of #38673 .\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^ Add

Not only because of that reason there should be ORM re-configured on initialization of the processes spawned.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, ProcessPoolExecutor catches all exceptions raised in its' workers and sets information about them in the result object. However, we're not waiting or checking the status of submitted jobs, therefore exceptions are _swallowed_ and logged anywhere.\r\n\r\nI tried adding some tests for checking if logs land properly now from within OpenLineageListener's ProcessPoolExecutor jobs. Pytest seems not to like `multiprocessing` and I ended up giving up on the tests. \r\nBoth changes, however, were tested in breeze and Astro Cloud with running 1000 concurrent DagRuns and gave expected results.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nRead the **[Pull Request
