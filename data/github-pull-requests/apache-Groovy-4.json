The Context\r\nFollowing discussion on GROOVY-9541 and [a prior pull request](https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/1814#issuecomment-1292252517), here's a proposal for how to address GROOVY-9541.\r\n\r\nOne notable impact of the bug is that collector annotations like `@Immutable` and `@Canonical` won't work consistently due to the `ASTTransformationCollectorCodeVisitor#findCollectedAnnotations` method's dependence on `StaticTypeCheckingSupport#evaluateExpression`.\r\n\r\n# The Fix\r\nBasically, make a classloader a required parameter of `StaticTypeCheckingSupport#evaluateExpression`. In OSGi and other affected contexts, that should prevent Groovy from using the context classloader by default.\r\n\r\nAs @eric-milles noted on the previous PR, each usage of `evaluateExpression` needs evaluated to determine which classloader should be passed. This has been done, and all usages in this repository have been updated. I've also kept the old method signature as a deprecated method for backward compatibility.\r\n\r\n# The Kludge\r\nOne problem I ran into was that, with the fix in the first commit (b7d964b), the `compileTestGroovy` task fails with errors like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n.../src/spec/test/testingguide/GroovyTestCaseExampleTests.groovy: Could not find class for Transformation Processor org.apache.groovy.test.transform.NotYetImplementedASTTransformation declared by groovy.test.NotYetImplemented\r\n```\r\n\r\nI tracked this down to the call to `ASTTransformationCollectorCodeVisitor#loadTransformClass` from the `findCollectedAnnotations` method on the same class. A lot of files, like `GroovyTestCaseExampleTests.groovy` were failing to compile because they couldn't load the `NotYetImplementedASTTransformation` annotation anymore.\r\n\r\nThat baffled me, since I couldn't see how the `transformLoader` field used there would be affected by the change at line 186:\r\n```\r\n.map(exp -> evaluateExpression(exp, source.getConfiguration(), transformLoader))\r\n```\r\n\r\n...yet that was the one that, if changed to `null`, worked just fine.\r\n\r\nBased on that, it appeared that call to `evaluateExpression` was changing the state of the GroovyClassLoader in a way that could cause it to later fail to load classes that would be known otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe workaround I used in the second commit was to create a new GroovyClassLoader with the one supplied as a parent. I don't entirely like it, as `new`ing up a classloader on every call to `evaluateExpression` is liable to lead to excessive garbage collection when all those ephemeral classloaders have to get thrown away.\r\n\r\nSo really, I'm writing all this to seek advice on a better way to address the problem. \r\n\r\nHere's the full stack trace swallowed by `ASTTransformationCollectorCodeVisitor#loadTransformClass`'s catch clause (if you revert back to b7d964b8):\r\n\r\n```\r\njava.lang.ClassNotFoundException:

background may be found in the comments of https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GROOVY-9541.\r\n\r\nAs @eric-milles noted there, we may need to do a more careful consideration of each consumer of `StaticTypeCheckingSupport#evaluateExpression`, since the `source` object's classloader may not actually be correct in every case.\r\n\r\nI can attest that letting `org.codehaus.groovy.transform.ASTTransformationCollectorCodeVisitor#findCollectedAnnotations` use the context classloader will result in difficult-to-resolve cases of GROOVY-9541. \r\n\r\nA word about 4616fc8: without that, you'll get a [cast_failure](https://github.com/apache/groovy/files/9864104/cast_failure.txt) when trying to compile the groovy-macro module. I was a bit nervous about it, but I think `java.util.Optional#map` provides enough null safety that it should work.\r\n\r\nMy local test suite is still finishing execution, but I thought a concrete diff & a PR would be helpful for the discussion.","created_at":"2022-10-25T21:20:59Z","updated_at":"2022-10-26T15:48:28Z","closed_at":"2022-10-26T15:47:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a3697b65cb50dcd87f02e5442ab3b537d8c84526","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/1814/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/1814/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/1814/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/statuses/4616fc8f746f100babfd988c3b61317aedd68a3e","head":{"label":"jonnybot0:bugfix/GROOVY-9541-respect-parent-classloader","ref":"bugfix/GROOVY-9541-respect-parent-classloader","sha":"4616fc8f746f100babfd988c3b61317aedd68a3e","user":{"login":"jonnybot0","id":3723592,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MjM1OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3723592?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonnybot0","html_url":"https://github.com/jonnybot0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonnybot0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonnybot0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonnybot0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonnybot0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonnybot0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonnybot0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonnybot0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonnybot0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonnybot0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":555391721,"node_id":"R_kgDOIRqa6Q","name":"groovy","full_name":"jonnybot0/groovy","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jonnybot0","id":3723592,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MjM1OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3723592?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonnybot0","html_url":"https://github.com/jonnybot0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonnybot0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonnybot0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonnybot0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonnybot0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonnybot0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonnybot0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonnybot0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonnybot0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonnybot0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jonnybot0/groovy","description":"Apache

PR adds explicit [permissions section](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#permissions) to workflows. This is a security best practice because by default workflows run with [extended set of permissions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#permissions-for-the-github_token) (except from `on: pull_request` [from external forks](https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-preventing-pwn-requests/)). By specifying any permission explicitly all others are set to none. By using the principle of least privilege the damage a compromised workflow can do (because of an [injection](https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-untrusted-input/) or compromised third party tool or action) is restricted.\r\nIt is recommended to have [most strict permissions on the top level](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/main/docs/checks.md#token-permissions) and grant write permissions on [job level](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/assigning-permissions-to-jobs) case by

is the more controversial change of https://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/1766 so it can be debated/evaluated in isolation.\r\n\r\nA small change in `StaticTypeCheckingSupport#getDistance` can resolve the `map[\"$key\"]` issues. I know Cedric stated in 6668 that this should be an STC error, but if there is just one method and it accepts String, it will be chosen for a GString argument. This change just closes the distance between GString and String so that `m(String)` is selected over `m(Object)`. Yes, this puts `Map#get` and `Map#getAt` out of alignment for GString arguments, which was a stated concern.  But the gain is in alignment of dynamic and static behaviors.\r\n\r\nI checked `put` and `putAt` and I think there is consistency with `get` and `getAt`.  You can read and write via GString or String interchangeably.  I think this is the expectation of most users as described in 6668.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/708\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/groovy/pull/1766\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GROOVY-6668\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GROOVY-8212\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GROOVY-9529\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GROOVY-9617","created_at":"2022-08-24T14:54:39Z","updated_at":"2022-12-02T14:58:19Z","closed_at":"2022-09-17T16:34:25Z","merged_at":"2022-09-17T16:34:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"5064b65afa0f3acf5490f1ea458163411c0c6339","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/1770/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/1770/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/1770/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/statuses/5eae3e7cb0a87b8442fd846420477b8e59ceda76","head":{"label":"apache:GROOVY-6668","ref":"GROOVY-6668","sha":"5eae3e7cb0a87b8442fd846420477b8e59ceda76","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34039690,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDAzOTY5MA==","name":"groovy","full_name":"apache/groovy","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy","description":"Apache

choice between methods `m(String,Object)` and `m(Object,String)`, prefer closer parameter matching. This aligns with the method selection of the dynamic compiler/runtime.  There is much more discussion of the various test cases in the ticket.\r\n\r\nWith selection of `getAt(Object,String)` over `getAt(Map,Object)` and `putAt(Object,String,Object)` over `putAt(Map,K,V)` there are quite a few STC test issues.  Not sure if I should separate them out to a test script just for 8788 or mitigate them with some minor changes or something else.  Or if some special STC checks should be added for maps with string keys.  I'd be interested to hear how this sits now.  @blackdrag @paulk-asert
