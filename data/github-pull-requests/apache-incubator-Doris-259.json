Proposed changes\r\n**Support token_bf index for token search:** \r\n\r\n1.  Token_bf index is mainly used to optimise English text searching accurately.  It can split sentences by non-numeric and non-characters and construct bloom filter. When searching by like、not like、startsWith、in、not in、endswith, it can accelerate searching time.  This pr is only support like.\r\n2. vs ngram_bf index, In English text\r\n   (1) Token_bf index has 100% up. \r\n   (2) It doesn't need to provide ngram_size parameter.\r\n3. vs inverted index\r\n    case sensitive\r\n4. Limitation\r\n In like '%xxx%' sql,  token_bf index will not be used. Because the bloom filter records the whole token and it can't process part of it.  We can use like '% xxx %'  or hastoken(xxx)  function to process.\r\n\r\n **Test:**\r\n2kw data,  BUCKETS 1\r\n```\r\n       CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS hits_url4 (\r\n                UserID int,\r\n

Proposed changes\r\n\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nA very simple implementation to query hive views, **it is an EXPERIMENTAL feature**.  We can try to parse the ddl of hive views and try to execute the query relies on the fact that  HiveQL is very similar to Doris SQL. But if the ddl of hive views use some complicated or incompatible grammar, the query might fail.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n* [ ] Does it affect the original behavior\r\n* [ ] Has unit tests been added\r\n* [ ] Has document been added or modified\r\n* [ ] Does it need to update dependencies\r\n* [ ] Is this PR support rollback (If NO, please explain WHY)\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and

Proposed changes\r\n\r\n1. Supports sampling to collect statistics\r\n2. Improved syntax for collecting statistics\r\n3. Support histogram specifies the number of buckets\r\n4. Tweaked some code structure\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe syntax supports WITH and PROPERTIES, using the same syntax as before.\r\n\r\nColumn Statistics Collection Syntax:\r\n```SQL\r\nANALYZE [ SYNC ] TABLE table_name\r\n     [ (column_name [, ...]) ]\r\n     [ [WITH SYNC] | [WITH INCREMENTAL] | [WITH SAMPLE PERCENT | ROWS ] ]\r\n     [ PROPERTIES ('key' = 'value', ...) ];\r\n```\r\n\r\nColumn histogram collection syntax:\r\n```SQL\r\nANALYZE [ SYNC ] TABLE table_name\r\n     [ (column_name [, ...]) ]\r\n     UPDATE HISTOGRAM\r\n     [ [ WITH SYNC ][ WITH INCREMENTAL ][ WITH SAMPLE PERCENT | ROWS ][ WITH BUCKETS ] ]\r\n     [ PROPERTIES ('key' = 'value', ...) ];\r\n```\r\n\r\nIllustrate：\r\n- sync：Collect statistics synchronously. Return after collecting.\r\n- incremental：Collect statistics incrementally. Incremental collection of histogram statistics is not supported.\r\n- sample percent | rows：Collect statistics by sampling. Scale and number of rows can be sampled.\r\n- buckets：Specifies the maximum number of buckets generated when collecting histogram statistics.\r\n- table_name: The purpose table for collecting statistics. Can be of the form `db_name.table_name`.\r\n- column_name: The specified destination column must be a column that exists in `table_name`, and multiple column names are separated by commas.\r\n- properties：Properties used to set statistics tasks. Currently only the following configurations are supported (equivalent to the with statement)\r\n   - 'sync' = 'true'\r\n   - 'incremental' = 'true'\r\n   - 'sample.percent' = '50'\r\n   - 'sample.rows' = '1000'\r\n   - 'num.buckets' = 10\r\n\r\n--- \r\n\r\nTODO: \r\n- Supplement the complete p0 test\r\n- `Incremental` statistics see pr18653\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nDescribe your changes.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n* [ ] Does it affect the original behavior\r\n* [ ] Has unit tests been added\r\n* [ ] Has document been added or

Proposed changes\r\nAdd `MergeRangeFileReader` to merge small IO to optimize parquet&orc read performance.\r\n\r\n`MergeRangeFileReader` is a FileReader that efficiently supports random access in format like parquet and orc. In order to merge small IO in parquet and orc, the random access ranges should be generated when creating the reader. The random access ranges is a list of ranges that order by offset. The range in random access ranges should be reading sequentially, can be skipped, but can't be read repeatedly. When calling read_at, if the start offset located in random access ranges, the slice size should not span two ranges.\r\n\r\nFor example, in parquet, the random access ranges is the column offsets in a row group.\r\n\r\nWhen reading at offset, if [offset, offset + 8MB) contains many random access ranges, the reader will read data in [offset, offset + 8MB) as a whole, and copy the data in random access ranges into small buffers(name as box, default 1MB, 64MB in total). A box can be occupied by many ranges, and use a reference counter to record how many ranges are cached in the box. If reference counter equals zero, the box can be release or reused by other ranges. When there is no empty box for a new read operation, the read operation will do directly.\r\n\r\n## Effects\r\nThe runtime of ClickBench reduces from 102s to 77s, and the runtime of Query 24 reduces from 24.74s to 9.45s.\r\nThe profile of Query 24:\r\n```\r\n VFILE_SCAN_NODE  (id=0):(Active:  8s344ms,  %  non-child:  83.06%)\r\n    -  FileReadBytes:  534.46  MB\r\n    -  FileReadCalls:  1.031K  (1031)\r\n    -  FileReadTime:  28s801ms\r\n    -  GetNextTime:  8s304ms\r\n    -  MaxScannerThreadNum:  12\r\n    -  MergedSmallIO:  0ns\r\n        -  CopyTime:  157.774ms\r\n        -  MergedBytes:  549.91  MB\r\n        -  MergedIO:  94\r\n        -  ReadTime:  28s642ms\r\n        -  RequestBytes:  507.96  MB\r\n        -  RequestIO:  1.001K  (1001)\r\n    -  NumScanners:  18\r\n```\r\n1001 request IOs has been merged into 94 IOs.\r\n\r\n## Remaining problems\r\n1. Add p2 regression test in nest PR\r\n2. Profiles are scattered in various codes and will be refactored in the next PR\r\n3. Support ORC reader\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n* [ ] Does it affect the original behavior\r\n* [ ] Has unit tests been added\r\n* [ ] Has document been added or modified\r\n* [ ] Does it need to update dependencies\r\n* [ ] Is this PR support rollback (If NO, please explain WHY)\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered,

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: #18646\r\n\r\nBE Part #19708 \r\n\r\nSupport the operator `PartitionTopN`, which can partition first and do the topn operation later in each partition. It used in the following case\r\n```\r\n-- Support push the filter down to the window and generate the PartitionTopN.\r\n-- The plan change from `window -> filter` to `partitionTopN -> window -> filter`.\r\nexplain select *  from (select * , row_number() over(partition by b order by a) as num from t ) tt where  num <= 10;\r\n\r\n-- Support push the limit down to the window and generate the PartitionTopN. \r\n-- The plan change from `window -> limit` to `partitionTopN -> window -> limit `.\r\nexplain select row_number() over(partition by b order by a) as num from t limit 10;\r\n\r\n-- Support push the topn down to the window and generate the PartitionTopN. \r\n-- The plan change from `window -> topn` to `partitionTopN -> window -> topn `.\r\nexplain select row_number() over(partition by b order by a) as num from t order by num limit 10;\r\n```\r\n\r\n## The detail design:\r\n\r\n### FE Part\r\n1. Add the following rewrite rules:\r\n    - PUSHDOWN_FILTER_THROUGH_WINDOW\r\n    - PUSH_LIMIT_THROUGH_PROJECT_WINDOW\r\n    - PUSH_LIMIT_THROUGH_WINDOW\r\n    - PUSHDOWN_TOP_N_THROUGH_PROJECTION_WINDOW\r\n    - PUSHDOWN_TOP_N_THROUGH_WINDOW\r\n2. Add the PartitionTopN node(LogicalPlan/ PhysicalPlan/ TranslatorPlan)\r\n3. For the rewrite plan, there are several requests that need to meet:\r\n    - For the `Filter` part, only consider `</ <=/ =` conditions. And the filter conditions will be stored.\r\n    - For the `Window` part, we only support one window function. And we support the `row_number`, `rank`, `dense_rank` window functions. And the `partition by` key and `order by` key can not be empty at the same time. The `Window Frame` should be `UNBOUNDED to CURRENT`.\r\n4. For the `PhysicalPartitionTopN`, the requested property is `Any`and the output property is its children's property.\r\n\r\nThat's the main details that are very important. For the other part, you can directly check the code.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n* [x] Does it affect the original behavior\r\n* [x] Has unit tests been added\r\n* [ ] Has document been added or modified\r\n* [ ] Does it need to update dependencies\r\n* [x] Is this PR support rollback (If NO, please explain WHY)\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-04-18T10:09:58Z","updated_at":"2023-05-26T06:43:15Z","closed_at":"2023-05-26T03:23:49Z","merged_at":"2023-05-26T03:23:49Z","merge_commit_sha":"dee9c2240fbca39e8c2e2d5af01c8df3490d13d9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1691596842,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjkxNTk2ODQy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/area/load","name":"area/load","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":"Issues

(truncated)</p>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Changelog</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/main/RELEASES.md\">github.com/containerd/containerd's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h1>Versioning and Release</h1>\n<p>This document details the versioning and release plan for containerd. Stability\nis a top goal for this project, and we hope that this document and the processes\nit entails will help to achieve that. It covers the release process, versioning\nnumbering, backporting, API stability and support horizons.</p>\n<p>If you rely on containerd, it would be good to spend time understanding the\nareas of the API that are and are not supported and how they impact your\nproject in the future.</p>\n<p>This document will be considered a living document. Supported timelines,\nbackport targets and API stability guarantees will be updated here as they\nchange.</p>\n<p>If there is something that you require or this document leaves out, please\nreach out by <a href=\"https://github.com/containerd/containerd/issues\">filing an issue</a>.</p>\n<h2>Releases</h2>\n<p>Releases of containerd will be versioned using dotted triples, similar to\n<a href=\"http://semver.org/\">Semantic Version</a>. For the purposes of this document, we\nwill refer to the respective components of this triple as\n<code>&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;.&lt;patch&gt;</code>. The version number may have additional information,\nsuch as alpha, beta and release candidate qualifications. Such releases will be\nconsidered &quot;pre-releases&quot;.</p>\n<h3>Major and Minor Releases</h3>\n<p>Major and minor releases of containerd will be made from main. Releases of\ncontainerd will be marked with GPG signed tags and announced at\n<a href=\"https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases\">https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases</a>. The tag will be of the\nformat <code>v&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;.&lt;patch&gt;</code> and should be made with the command <code>git tag -s v&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;.&lt;patch&gt;</code>.</p>\n<p>After a minor release, a branch will be created, with the format\n<code>release/&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;</code> from the minor tag. All further patch releases will\nbe done from that branch. For example, once we release <code>v1.0.0</code>, a branch\n<code>release/1.0</code> will be created from that tag.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nFor now, there are 3 packages for the release binaries of Doris: https://doris.apache.org/download\r\nAnd user may be confused about how to download and deploy these packages.\r\n\r\nSo I provide a download script for each release, and user can simply download the script and run it, like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n> sh download_x64_apache.sh\r\n\r\nBegin to download FE from \"https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/apache/doris/1.2/1.2.3-rc02/apache-doris-fe-1.2.3-bin-x86_64.tar.xz\" to \"apache-doris-1.2.3-bin/\" ...\r\nTotal size: 408078012

\"https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/apache/doris/1.2/1.2.3-rc02/apache-doris-be-1.2.3-bin-x86_64.tar.xz\" to \"apache-doris-1.2.3-bin/\" ...\r\nTotal size: 606211324

Bytes\r\n#################################################### 100.0%\r\nBegin to assemble the binaries ...\r\nMove java-udf-jar-with-dependencies.jar to be/lib/ ...\r\nDownload complete!\r\nYou can now deploy Apache Doris from apache-doris-1.2.3-bin/\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe script will do the rest.\r\n\r\nThis script will later be published on the Download page of Apache Doris website, so that user can easily get\r\nit and use it.\r\n\r\nCurrently only for Linux platform. Other platform is untested.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n* [ ] Does it affect the original behavior\r\n* [ ] Has unit tests been added\r\n* [ ] Has document been added or modified\r\n* [ ] Does it need to update dependencies\r\n* [ ] Is this PR support rollback (If NO, please explain WHY)\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-04-16T07:19:09Z","updated_at":"2023-04-16T13:58:23Z","closed_at":"2023-04-16T08:50:00Z","merged_at":"2023-04-16T08:50:00Z","merge_commit_sha":"70a418c4a8e9350cb1cb93736b2e5c6fd9f8cf80","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2039763841,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDM5NzYzODQx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/approved","name":"approved","color":"00ff00","default":false,"description":"Indicates

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #18446\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nWhen table was dropped without FORCE, tablet in be will still do compaction as current tablet in be has no information about table status in fe. \r\n\r\nTo solve this problem, we add a field `is_dropped` to both fe and be 's TabletMeta to indicate whether the tablet is dropped, and tablet with `is_dropped=true` will not be compacted.\r\nWhen a table was dropped, the `is_dropped` in fe's TabletMeta will be set to true. When be reports tablet to fe, fe will compare be's `is_dropped` with its own. If it is different, fe will send an UPDATE_TABLET_META_INFO AgentTask to be to change be's `is_dropped`.\r\n\r\nThe recover process is similar to the above.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n* [ ] Does it affect the original behavior\r\n* [ ] Has unit tests been added\r\n* [ ] Has document been added or modified\r\n* [ ] Does it need to update dependencies\r\n* [ ] Is this PR support rollback (If NO, please explain WHY)\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered,

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nFor each release of Doris, there are some experimental features.\r\nThese feature may not stable or qualified enough, and user need to use it by setting config or session variables,\r\neg, `set enable_mtmv = true`, otherwise, these feature is disable by default.\r\n\r\nWe should explicitly tell user which features are experimental, so that user will notice that and decide whether to \r\nuse it.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I support the `experimental_` prefix for FE config and session variables.\r\n\r\n1. Session Variable\r\n\r\n\tGiven `enable_nereids_planner` as an example.\r\n\t\r\n\tThe Nereids planner is an experimental feature in Doris, so there is an `EXPERIMENTAL` annotation for it:\r\n\t\r\n\t```\r\n\t@VariableMgr.VarAttr(..., expType = ExperimentalType.EXPERIMENTAL)\r\n\tprivate boolean enableNereidsPlanner = false;\r\n\t```\r\n\t\r\n\tAnd for compatibility, user can set it by:\r\n\t\r\n\t```\r\n\tset enable_nereids_planner = true;\r\n\tset experimental_enable_nereids_planner = true;\r\n\t```\r\n\t\r\n\tAnd for `show variables`, it will only show `experimental_enable_nereids_planner` entry.\r\n\t\r\n\tAnd you can also see all experimental session variables by:\r\n\t\r\n\t```\r\n\tshow variables like \"%experimental%\"\r\n\t```\r\n\t\r\n2. Config\r\n\r\n\tSame as session variable, give `enable_mtmv` as an example.\r\n\t\r\n\t```\r\n\t@ConfField(..., expType = ExperimentalType.EXPERIMENTAL)\r\n    public static boolean enable_mtmv = false;\r\n\t```\r\n\t\r\n\tUser can set it in fe.conf or `ADMIN SET FRONTEND CONFIG` stmt with both names:\r\n\t\r\n\t```\r\n\tenable_mtmv\r\n\texperimental_enable_mtmv\r\n\t```\r\n\t\r\n\tAnd user can see all experimental FE configs by:\r\n\t\r\n\t```\r\n\tADMIN SHOW FRONTEND CONFIG LIKE \"%experimental%\";\r\n\t```\r\n\r\n### TODO\r\n\r\n1. Support this feature for BE config\r\n2. Only add `experimental` for:\r\n    - `enable_pipeline_engine`\r\n    - `enable_nereids_planner`\r\n    - `enable_single_replica_insert` \r\n    \r\n    and FE config:\r\n\r\n    - `enable_mtmv`\r\n    - `enabel_ssl`\r\n    - `enable_fqdn_mode`\r\n\r\n    Should modify other config and session vars\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n* [ ] Does it affect the original behavior\r\n* [ ] Has unit tests been added\r\n* [ ] Has document been added or modified\r\n* [ ] Does it need to update dependencies\r\n* [ ] Is this PR support rollback (If NO, please explain WHY)\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-04-15T17:13:00Z","updated_at":"2023-04-30T13:35:28Z","closed_at":"2023-04-16T10:32:11Z","merged_at":"2023-04-16T10:32:11Z","merge_commit_sha":"1cbbc60822ec551f3fa1ab60bce1e4e765824c98","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1817282214,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxODE3MjgyMjE0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/kind/test","name":"kind/test","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":""},{"id":5441753958,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBfSlxs8AAAABRFqTZg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/dev/2.0.0-alpha1-merged","name":"dev/2.0.0-alpha1-merged","color":"BE59E4","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/pulls/18699/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/pulls/18699/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/issues/18699/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/statuses/52f48819b57217cf3518894ca6d690a9886c2af1","head":{"label":"morningman:expr_config","ref":"expr_config","sha":"52f48819b57217cf3518894ca6d690a9886c2af1","user":{"login":"morningman","id":2899462,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTk0NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2899462?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman","html_url":"https://github.com/morningman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":155175398,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTUxNzUzOTg=","name":"doris","full_name":"morningman/doris","private":false,"owner":{"login":"morningman","id":2899462,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTk0NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2899462?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman","html_url":"https://github.com/morningman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/morningman/doris","description":"Apache
