it is not possible to patch Pool in BaseOperator as the signature sets the default value of Pool as Pool.DEFAULT_POOL_NAME.\r\nBecause of this, test case which uses SubDagOperator breaks because of the _validate_pool in subdag_operator.py (L96). Here it tries to query DB to resolve pool conflict, and fails with the following error:\r\n```\r\n                         def do_execute(self, cursor, statement, parameters, context=None):\r\n                     >       cursor.execute(statement, parameters)\r\n                     E       sqlalchemy.exc.OperationalError: (sqlite3.OperationalError) no such table: slot_pool\r\n                     E       [SQL: SELECT slot_pool.id AS slot_pool_id, slot_pool.pool AS slot_pool_pool, slot_pool.slots AS slot_pool_slots, slot_pool.description AS slot_pool_description \r\n                     E       FROM slot_pool \r\n                     E       WHERE slot_pool.slots = ? AND slot_pool.pool = ?\r\n                     E        LIMIT ?

OperationalError\r\n\r\n```\r\nMy assumption here is that DB doesn't exist for running test cases, hence I am patching `Pool.DEFAULT_POOL_NAME` to `None`, so that it won't enter the _validate_pool of subdag_operator.\r\n\r\nHere is a gist link of what I am trying to do:\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/vshshjn7/cdf869b9c9ef5a73c4ffbf73b498c71d\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before

`EmrCreateJobFlowOperator` and `EmrAddStepsOperator` operators already support receiving `job_flow_overrides` and `steps` arguments as templates. However, one of the benefits of templating is the ability to refer to a file, which is not currently supported. A good example of an existing operator which leverages file templates is `BashOperator`, which applies this principle to its [bash_command](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/stable/_api/airflow/operators/bash_operator/index.html#airflow.operators.bash_operator.BashOperator) parameter.\r\n\r\nAdding such support will improve the usability of the operators greatly, since at the moment the only way to do it is manually invoking Jinja to read the files before passing the arguments to the operators.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR simply adds the proper file extensions to `template_ext` field, and converts the resulting string into a Python dictionary.\r\n\r\n---\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before creating PR: [x]\r\n\r\n-

the docker-compose environment fails to initialise. It is\r\none of two problems:\r\n\r\n* DNS fwd/rev mismatch on checking the docker compose integration\r\n* Missing name for the docker compose intagration\r\n\r\nThis is likely due to some race conditions when setting up docker\r\ncompose network and DNS.

PR tries to land https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/3584. Most changes are from @Eronarn, I rebased on master and added a few tests.\r\n\r\nAs per @Eronarn :\r\n\r\n> ### JIRA\r\n> AIRFLOW-249 Refactor the SLA mechanism\r\n>\r\n> This is a fairly large patch that should and/or may also address:\r\n>\r\n> AIRFLOW-1360 SLA miss goes to all emails in DAG\r\n> AIRFLOW-2236 Airflow SLA is triggered for all backfilled tasks\r\n> AIRFLOW-557 SLA notification does not work for manually triggered DAGs\r\n> AIRFLOW-133 SLAs don't seem to work with schedule_interval=None\r\n> AIRFLOW-1013 airflow/jobs.py:manage_slas() exception for @once dag\r\n>\r\n> ### Description\r\n> At Quantopian we use Airflow to produce artifacts based on the previous day's stock market data. These artifacts are required for us to trade on today's stock market. Therefore, I've been investing time in improving Airflow notifications (such as writing PagerDuty and Slack integrations). My attention has turned to Airflow's SLA system, which has some drawbacks for our use case:\r\n>\r\n> Defining SLAs can be awkward because they are relative to the execution date instead of the task start time. There's no way to alert if a task runs for \"more than an hour\", for any non-trivial DAG. Instead you can only express \"more than an hour from execution date\". The financial data we use varies in when it arrives, and how long it takes to process (data volume changes frequently). We also run DAGs with mixed UTC and Eastern events, making Airflow SLA definitions depend on time of year.\r\n> \r\n> Execution timeouts can capture \"more than an hour\" but do not serve the same purpose as SLAs. We have tight timelines on long-duration tasks that make retries difficult, so we want to alert an operator while leaving the original task running, rather than failing and then alerting.\r\n>\r\n> The way that SLA miss callbacks are defined is not intuitive, as in contrast to other callbacks, they are defined on the DAG rather than on the task. This has lead to a lot of confusion in JIRA/the mailing list; many people think that SLAs are for DAG completion, when in reality it's a DAG-level attribute that handles batched task-level completions. Also, the call signature is poorly defined: for instance, two of the arguments are just strings produced from the other two arguments.\r\n>\r\n> SLA miss emails don't include any links back to the Airflow instance (important for us because we run the same DAGs in both staging/production) or the execution date they apply to. When opened, they be hard to read for even a moderately sized DAG because they include a flat list of task instances that are unsorted (neither alpha nor topo).\r\n>\r\n> SLA miss emails are sent to every email address associated with the DAG. This can lead to inadvertent paging of users associated with unrelated \"forks\" in the DAG from where the SLA miss failed.\r\n>\r\n> SLA emails are not callbacks, and can't be turned off (other than either removing the SLA or removing the email attribute on the task instance).\r\n>\r\n> This patch attempts to address the above issues by making some of the following changes:\r\n>\r\n> The sla= parameter is split into:\r\n> **expected_start**: Timedelta after execution date, representing when this task must have started by.\r\n> **expected_finish**: Timedelta after execution date, representing when this task must have finished by.\r\n> **expected_duration**: Timedelta after task start, representing how long this task is expected to run, including all retries.\r\n> These parameters are set on a task (or DAG-level default args), and a task can have any combination of them, though there is some basic validation logic to warn you if you try to set an illogical combination. The SlaMiss object stores the type of SLA miss as a new database field, which is a component of the primary key.\r\n>\r\n> There is logic to convert the existing sla= parameter to expected_finish (as well as a migration), since that's the closest parallel, so it should be relatively backwards compatible.\r\n>\r\n> SLA misses are no longer grouped for checks or callbacks. While there have always been independent per-task SlaMiss objects, there was a lot of logic to poll for all SlaMisses that occurred at the same time, and to batch them into a single email.\r\n>\r\n> As a consequence of 2), The sla_miss_callback is no longer set on the DAG level, which has been confusing. It now has a context-based signature to be consistent with other task callbacks. This change is not backwards compatible for anyone using custom SLA miss callbacks, but should be a fairly straightforward conversion.\r\n>\r\n> The SLA miss email is now the default SLA miss callback on tasks. Previously it was an additional non-overrideable feature.\r\n>\r\n> The SLA miss email has some improvements:\r\n> \r\n> 1. Only one SLA miss per email\r\n> 2. SLA-miss-specific title\r\n> 3. Includes a link to the task instance\r\n> 4. Only includes potentially-blocked downstreams\r\n> 5. Sends to a list of \"interested subscribers\", which is defined as all email addresses on tasks downstream of the task that missed its SLA.\r\n> 6. Additional ASCII art to help distinguish emails.\r\n> 7. Move the SLA miss code largely out of the Scheduler code: some into models (DAGs manage their own SlaMiss objects), and some into SLA helper functions.\r\n>\r\n> Overall, attempt to reduce the complexity and lack of documentation of the SLA miss logic, given the constraint that the new implementation is a larger feature and more lines of code. The previous implementation was stuffed into one overloaded function that is responsible for checking for SLA misses, creating database objects for them, filtering tasks, selecting emails, rendering, and sending. These are now broken into multiple functions, which attempt to be more single-purpose.\r\n\r\n---\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before creating PR: [x]\r\n\r\n- [x] Description above provides

PR adds functionality that allows a RSA public key part to be specified in the extra field of the SSH Connection. This will improve security by making it easier to specify a host key to verify connections against. Previously, you had to edit the `~.ssh/known_hosts` file directly which I have found cumbersome to maintain when running Airflow on Kubernetes.\r\n\r\n---\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before

I talked to @kaxil about testing our views. I suggested that we should test templates and flask views separately  I have prepared a POC that shows how it can be done. I think this can increase confidence in these tests. We are currently testing only random words, but very much logic has no coverage and it is very difficult to make changes. If you want to make changes, you always have to test everything manually to see if the logic is behaving correctly. If we have automatic tests with a higher level of confidence then the changes will be easier to review and we will trust them more.\r\n\r\n---\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before creating PR:
