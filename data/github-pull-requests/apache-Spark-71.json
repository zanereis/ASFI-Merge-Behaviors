What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nChange getBytes/getShorts/getInts/getLongs/getFloats/getDoubles in `OnHeapColumnVector` and `OffHeapColumnVector` to use the dictionary, if present.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe following query gets incorrect results:\r\n```\r\ndrop table if exists t1;\r\n\r\ncreate table t1 using parquet as\r\nselect * from values\r\n(named_struct('f1', array(1, 2, 3), 'f2', array(1, 1, 2)))\r\nas (value);\r\n\r\nselect cast(value as struct<f1:array<double>,f2:array<int>>) AS value from t1;\r\n\r\n{\"f1\":[1.0,2.0,3.0],\"f2\":[0,0,0]}\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe result should be:\r\n```\r\n{\"f1\":[1.0,2.0,3.0],\"f2\":[1,2,3]}\r\n```\r\nThe cast operation copies the second array by calling `ColumnarArray#copy`, which in turn calls `ColumnarArray#toIntArray`, which in turn calls `ColumnVector#getInts` on the underlying column vector (which is either an `OnHeapColumnVector` or an `OffHeapColumnVector`). The implementation of `getInts` in either concrete class assumes there is no dictionary and does not use it if it is present (in fact, it even asserts that there is no dictionary). However, in the above example, the column vector associated with the second array does have a dictionary:\r\n```\r\njava -cp ~/github/parquet-mr/parquet-tools/target/parquet-tools-1.10.1.jar org.apache.parquet.tools.Main meta ./spark-warehouse/t1/part-00000-122fdd53-8166-407b-aec5-08e0c2845c3d-c000.snappy.parquet\r\n...\r\nrow group 1: RC:1 TS:112 OFFSET:4 \r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nvalue:       \r\n.f1:         \r\n..list:      \r\n...element:   INT32 SNAPPY DO:0 FPO:4 SZ:47/47/1.00 VC:3 ENC:RLE,PLAIN ST:[min: 1, max: 3, num_nulls: 0]\r\n.f2:         \r\n..list:      \r\n...element:   INT32 SNAPPY DO:51 FPO:80 SZ:69/65/0.94 VC:3 ENC:RLE,PLAIN_DICTIONARY ST:[min: 1, max: 2, num_nulls: 0]\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe same bug also occurs when field f2 is a map. This PR fixes that case as well.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, except for fixing the correctness issue.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to check that the `class` and `method` arguments are not a NULL in `CallMethodViaReflection`. And if they are, throw an `AnalysisException` with new error class `DATATYPE_MISMATCH.UNEXPECTED_NULL`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo fix the issue demonstrated by the example:\r\n```sql\r\n$ spark-sql (default)> select reflect('java.util.UUID', CAST(NULL AS STRING));\r\n[INTERNAL_ERROR] The Spark SQL phase analysis failed with an internal error. You hit a bug in Spark or the Spark plugins you use.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nPartial back-port of https://github.com/databricks/spark-xml/commit/994e357f7666956b5d0e63627716b2c092d9abbd?diff=split from spark-xml\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThough no more development was intended on spark-xml, there was a non-trivial improvement to inference speed that I committed anyway to resolve a customer issue. Part of it can be 'backported' here to sync the code. I attached this as a follow-up to the main code port JIRA.\r\n\r\nThere is still, in general, no intent to commit more to spark-xml in the meantime unless it's significantly important.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, this should only speed up schema inference without behavior change.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTested in spark-xml, and will be tested by tests here

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdd the ephemeral storage configs for spark on kubernetes.  \r\nUser can specify these configs to make their program more configurable.  \r\n`--conf spark.kubernetes.driver.ephemeralStorageGB.request xxx\r\n`\r\n`--conf spark.kubernetes.driver.ephemeralStorageGB.limit xxx\r\n`\r\n`--conf spark.kubernetes.executor.ephemeralStorageGB.request xxx\r\n`\r\n`--conf spark.kubernetes.executor.ephemeralStorageGB.limit xxx\r\n`\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIt can be used in the spark-submit command handily.  \r\nImage that you build a platform to help users to submit their data pipelines with spark, it would be very convenient to have these parameters to support user's different demands.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo. This PR does not introduce any user-facing change.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to support a new configuration `spark.master.rest.host` to allow REST Server to choose a host to listen.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis allows additional controllability on the REST Server.\r\n\r\nIn addition, in K8s environment, K8s port-forwarding only works with 127.0.0.1.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ kubectl port-forward svc/master 6066\r\nForwarding from 127.0.0.1:6066 -> 6066\r\nForwarding from [::1]:6066 -> 6066\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's difficult to use `port-forward` because the AS-IS Spark REST Server only listens the podIP and not 127.0.0.1. \r\n\r\nWe can use `spark.master.rest.host=0.0.0.0` with this PR.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nIt was a little difficult to write a unit test code because it requires two IPs to test in CI.\r\n\r\nFor manual testing, start the REST API.\r\n```\r\n$ SPARK_NO_DAEMONIZE=1 SPARK_MASTER_OPTS=\"-Dspark.master.rest.enabled=true -Dspark.master.rest.host=0.0.0.0\" sbin/start-master.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd, connect with both IPs (your public IP and 127.0.0.1) on the machine.\r\n```\r\n$ curl -v http://127.0.0.1:6066/v1/submissions/status/0 \r\n$ curl -v http://a.b.c.d:6066/v1/submissions/status/0 \r\n```\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR makes sure the result grouped partitions from `DataSourceV2ScanExec#groupPartitions` are sorted according to the partition values. Previously in the #42757 we were assuming Scala would preserve the input ordering but apparently that's not the case.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/42757#discussion_r1316926504 for diagnosis. The partition ordering is a fundamental property for SPJ and thus must be guaranteed.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWe have tests in `KeyGroupedPartitioningSuite` to cover this.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to check the `accuracy` argument is not a NULL in `ApproximatePercentile`. And if it is, throw an `AnalysisException` with new error class `DATATYPE_MISMATCH.UNEXPECTED_NULL`.\r\n\r\nThis is a backport of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/42817.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo fix the issue demonstrated by the example:\r\n```sql\r\n$ spark-sql (default)> SELECT percentile_approx(col, array(0.5, 0.4, 0.1), NULL) FROM VALUES (0), (1), (2), (10) AS tab(col);\r\n[INTERNAL_ERROR] The Spark SQL phase analysis failed with an internal error. You hit a bug in Spark or the Spark plugins you use. Please, report this bug to the corresponding communities or vendors, and provide the full stack trace.\r\n``` \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running new test:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *.ApproximatePercentileQuerySuite\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nAuthored-by: Max Gekk <max.gekk@gmail.com>\r\n(cherry picked from commit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR re-enables Encoders.bean to be called against beans having read-only properties, that is properties that have only getters and no setter method. Beans with read only properties are even used in internal tests.\r\nSetter methods of a Java bean encoder are stored within an Option wrapper because they are missing in case of read-only properties. When a java bean has to be initialized, setter methods for the bean properties have to be called: this PR filters out read-only properties from that process.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n    This PR aims to upgrade Maven to 3.8.8 from 3.9.4.\r\n    \r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe new version [lift JDK minimum to JDK 8](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-7452) and [make the build work on JDK 20](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-7743) . It also brings a series of bug fixes, such as [Fix deadlock during forked lifecycle executions](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-7487), along with a number of new optimizations like [Profile activation by packaging](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-6609). On the other hand, the new version replaces 'Wagon' with 'native http' as the new [Maven Resolver transport](https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-resolver-transport.html), coupled with a range of targeted performance enhancements（See the upgrades related to Maven Resolver）.\r\n    \r\nFor other updates, refer to the corresponding release notes:\r\n    \r\n-

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to override `Scan.columnarSupportMode` for DSv2 streaming data sources. All of them don't support columnar. This applies [SPARK-44505](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-44505) to the DSv2 streaming data sources.\r\n\r\nRationalization will be explained in the next section.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe default value for `Scan.columnarSupportMode` is `PARTITION_DEFINED`, which requires `inputPartitions` to be called/evaluated. That could be referenced multiple times during planning.\r\n\r\nIn `MicrobatchScanExec`, we define `inputPartitions` as lazy val, so that there is no multiple evaluation of inputPartitions, which calls `MicroBatchStream.planInputPartitions`. But we missed that there is no guarantee that the instance will be initialized only once (although the actual execution will happen once) - for example, executedPlan clones the plan (internally we call constructor to make a deep copy of the node), explain (internally called to build a SQL execution start event), etc...\r\n\r\nI see `MicroBatchStream.planInputPartitions` gets called 4 times per microbatch, which can be concerning if the overhead of planInputPartitions is non-trivial, specifically Kafka.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting UTs.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2023-09-06T02:37:12Z","updated_at":"2023-09-07T10:43:08Z","closed_at":"2023-09-07T10:43:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2bd0c26806148e1accf25515c1d2dea3d205a62a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nMake StateOperatorProgress.numShufflePartitions to use the effective number of shuffle partitions is reported.\r\nThis metric StateStoreWriter.numShufflePartitions is dropped at the same time, as it is not a metric anymore.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, there is a numShufflePartitions \"metric\" reported in \r\nStateOperatorProgress part of the progress report. However, the number is reported by aggregating executors so in the case of task retry or speculative executor, the metric is higher than number of shuffle partitions for the query plan. We change the metric to use the value to use to make it more usable.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nStreamingAggregationSuite contains a unit test that validates the value \r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.","created_at":"2023-09-05T23:22:18Z","updated_at":"2023-09-15T01:36:57Z","closed_at":"2023-09-15T01:36:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2cf468f04a600bc382375e3a5cee6787128fcd5b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nMake INVALID_CURSOR.DISCONNECTED a retriable error.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis error can happen if two RPCs are racing to reattach to the query, and the client is still using the losing one. SPARK-44833 was a bug that exposed such a situation. That was fixed, but to be more robust, we can make this error retryable.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTests will be added in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/42560\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to check the `accuracy` argument is not a NULL in `ApproximatePercentile`.

You hit a bug in Spark or the Spark plugins you use. Please, report this bug to the corresponding communities or vendors, and provide the full stack trace.\r\n``` \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR captures the dataset APIs used by the user code and the call site in the user code and provides better error messages.\r\n\r\nE.g. consider the following Spark app `SimpleApp.scala`:\r\n```scala\r\n   1  import org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession\r\n   2  import org.apache.spark.sql.functions._\r\n   3\r\n   4  object SimpleApp {\r\n   5    def main(args: Array[String]) {\r\n   6      val spark = SparkSession.builder.appName(\"Simple Application\").config(\"spark.sql.ansi.enabled\", true).getOrCreate()\r\n   7      import spark.implicits._\r\n   8\r\n   9      val c = col(\"a\") / col(\"b\")\r\n  10\r\n  11      Seq((1, 0)).toDF(\"a\", \"b\").select(c).show()\r\n  12\r\n  13      spark.stop()\r\n  14    }\r\n  15  }\r\n``` \r\n\r\nAfter this PR the error message contains the error context (which Spark Dataset API is called from where in the user code) in the following form:\r\n```\r\nException in thread \"main\" org.apache.spark.SparkArithmeticException: [DIVIDE_BY_ZERO] Division by zero. Use `try_divide` to tolerate divisor being 0 and return NULL instead. If necessary set \"spark.sql.ansi.enabled\" to \"false\" to bypass this error.\r\n== Dataset ==\r\n\"div\" was called from SimpleApp$.main(SimpleApp.scala:9)\r\n\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.errors.QueryExecutionErrors$.divideByZeroError(QueryExecutionErrors.scala:201)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.DivModLike.eval(arithmetic.scala:672\r\n...\r\n```\r\nwhich is similar to the already provided context in case of SQL queries:\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.SparkArithmeticException: [DIVIDE_BY_ZERO] Division by zero. Use `try_divide` to tolerate divisor being 0 and return NULL instead. If necessary set \"spark.sql.ansi.enabled\" to \"false\" to bypass this error.\r\n== SQL(line 1, position 1) ==\r\na / b\r\n^^^^^\r\n\r\n\tat

this change doesn't help with that usecase.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo provide more user friendly errors.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new UTs to `QueryExecutionAnsiErrorsSuite`.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

The customization of `dagre-d3` is necessary for items like:\r\n\r\n- Save node and cluster IDs and labels for post-processing later, for example, `setupTooltipForSparkPlanNode`.\r\n- Add cluster label to the right top of cluster, which stays in the middle of the cluster. The label also affects the paddingTop of the cluster then.\r\n\r\nThe full list of commits can be found at:\r\n\r\n- In this Patch: https://github.com/yaooqinn/dagre-d3/compare/v0.6.4...v0.6.4-patch\r\n- Before this Patch: https://github.com/andrewor14/dagre-d3/compare/75c17e6e46eba98394d7209f67bb1988a43e2fc3...074b99f0b51ecbc939a5a78a1ee92da73e7cfd9e\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to separate PySpark distribution into `pyspark`, `pyspark_common` and `pyspark_connect`.\r\nEnd users would be able to do as follows:\r\n- `pip install pyspark`: Use the same namespace. Users can use PySpark with and without Spark Connect. Includes JVM.\r\n- `pip install pyspark pyspark_common --no-deps`: Use the same namespace. Users can only use non-Spark Connect.  Includes JVM.\r\n- `pip install pyspark_connect` : Use the different namespace. Users can only use Spark Connect. Pure Python library.\r\n- `pip install pyspark_common`: Use the different namespace. Users can use the common data types such as `Row` via `from pyspark_common.sql.types import Row`. Pure Python library.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n- In order to allow pure Python library with Spark Connect.\r\n- In order to allow the end users the option to exclude/include Spark Connect.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\n- No, `pip install pyspark` continues working.\r\n- Existing importing also continues to work, e.g., `from pyspark import errors` (and also `from pyspark_common import errors` will work too)\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- Testing `pyspark`\r\n    ```bash\r\n    ./sbin/start-connect-server.sh --jars `ls connector/connect/server/target/**/spark-connect*SNAPSHOT.jar`\r\n    cd python\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    ```python\r\n    from pyspark.sql import SparkSession\r\n    SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate().range(10).show()\r\n    SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate().stop()\r\n    SparkSession.builder.remote(\"sc://localhost:15002\").getOrCreate().range(10).show()\r\n    SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate().stop()\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n- Testing `pyspark_common`\r\n\r\n    ```bash\r\n    cd python\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    ```python\r\n    from pyspark_common.sql.types import Row\r\n    Row(a=1)\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n- Testing `pyspark_connect`\r\n\r\n    ```bash\r\n    ./sbin/start-connect-server.sh --jars `ls connector/connect/server/target/**/spark-connect*SNAPSHOT.jar`\r\n    cd python\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    ```python\r\n    from pyspark_connect.sql.session import SparkSession\r\n    SparkSession.builder.remote(\"sc://localhost:15002\").getOrCreate().range(10).show()\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n","created_at":"2023-09-05T06:33:05Z","updated_at":"2024-01-15T00:51:43Z","closed_at":"2023-12-17T00:20:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1405801475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/ML","name":"ML","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1405803268,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAzMjY4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/MLLIB","name":"MLLIB","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAmmonite places all user code inside Helper classes which are nested inside the class it creates for each command. This PR adds a custom code class wrapper for the Ammonite REPL. It makes sure the Helper classes generated by ammonite are always registered as an outer scope immediately. This way we can instantiate classes defined inside the Helper class, even when we execute Spark code as part of the Helper's constructor.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhen you currently define a class and execute a Spark command using that class inside the same cell/line this will fail with an NullPointerException. The reason for that is that we cannot resolve the outer scope needed to instantiate the class. This PR fixes that issue. The following code will now execute successfully (include the curly braces):\r\n```scala\r\n{\r\n  case class Thing(val value: String)\r\n  val r = (0 to 10).map( value => Thing(value.toString) )\r\n  spark.createDataFrame(r)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nI added more tests to the `ReplE2ESuite`.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.","created_at":"2023-09-04T18:01:51Z","updated_at":"2023-09-05T15:38:09Z","closed_at":"2023-09-05T13:35:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"295e34d02ca7e4e03ebe526f264cde1c3e6650ae","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42807/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42807/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/42807/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/38e893de31500073b67b5f47ab1f4580859ad731","head":{"label":"hvanhovell:SPARK-45072","ref":"SPARK-45072","sha":"38e893de31500073b67b5f47ab1f4580859ad731","user":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35900688,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTkwMDY4OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"hvanhovell/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell/spark","description":"Mirror

executeHolder.runGrpcResponseSender(responseSender) in SparkConnectReattachExecuteHandler first.\r\n* When ExecutePlan reaches executeHolder.runGrpcResponseSender(responseSender), and executionObserver.attachConsumer(this) is called in ExecuteGrpcResponseSender of ExecutePlan, it will kick out the ExecuteGrpcResponseSender of ReattachExecute.\r\n\r\nSo even though ReattachExecute came later, it will get interrupted by the earlier ExecutePlan and finish with a INVALID_CURSOR.DISCONNECTED error.\r\n\r\nAfter this change, such a race between ExecutePlan / ReattachExecute can still happens, but the client should no longer send these requests in such quick succession.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the method requireDbExist(db) in SessionCatalog.scala, currently, there is no check to ensure if it's for non-default db. The intention here is to check for other databases that would throw NoSuchDatabaseException if it doesn't exist. The 'default' database always exists in the system and cannot be dropped by anyone. \r\n\r\nIn the case when a Spark 3.1 cluster is created using shared metastore with Spark 2.4 cluster, it throws the following alert for default database:\r\n org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.analysis.NoSuchDatabaseException: Database 'default' not found (state=08S01,code=0)\r\n \r\nThis needs to be suppressed, as this is misleading because the Spark Thrift Server is running fine. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nAs the 'default' database always exists in the system and cannot be dropped by anyone, throwing the NoSuchDatabaseException for the default db is misleading.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSince `BinaryArithmetic#dataType` will recursively process the datatype of each node, the driver will be very slow when multiple columns are processed.\r\n\r\nFor example, the following code:\r\n```scala\r\nimport spark.implicits._\r\nimport scala.util.Random\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.Row\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.functions.sum\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.types.{StructType, StructField, IntegerType}\r\n\r\nval N = 30\r\nval M = 100\r\n\r\nval columns = Seq.fill(N)(Random.alphanumeric.take(8).mkString)\r\nval data = Seq.fill(M)(Seq.fill(N)(Random.nextInt(16) - 5))\r\n\r\nval schema = StructType(columns.map(StructField(_, IntegerType)))\r\nval rdd = spark.sparkContext.parallelize(data.map(Row.fromSeq(_)))\r\nval df = spark.createDataFrame(rdd, schema)\r\nval colExprs = columns.map(sum(_))\r\n\r\n// gen a new column , and add the other 30 column\r\ndf.withColumn(\"new_col_sum\", expr(columns.mkString(\" + \")))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis code will take a few minutes for the driver to execute in the spark3.4 version, but only takes a few seconds to execute in the spark3.2 version.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to support string type columns for `DataFrameGroupBy.sum`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo match the behavior with latest pandas.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, from now on the `DataFrameGroupBy.sum` follows the behavior of latest pandas as below:\r\n\r\n**Test DataFrame**\r\n```python\r\n>>> psdf\r\n   A    B  C      D\r\n0  1  3.1  a   True\r\n1  2  4.1  b  False\r\n2  1  4.1  b  False\r\n3  2  3.1  a   True\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Before**\r\n```python\r\n>>> psdf.groupby(\"A\").sum().sort_index()\r\n     B  D\r\nA\r\n1  7.2  1\r\n2  7.2  1\r\n```\r\n\r\n**After**\r\n```python\r\n>>> psdf.groupby(\"A\").sum().sort_index()\r\n     B   C  D\r\nA\r\n1  7.2  ab  1\r\n2  7.2  ba  1\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUpdated the existing UTs to support string type columns.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2023-09-04T08:58:43Z","updated_at":"2023-11-20T01:36:56Z","closed_at":"2023-09-11T05:06:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a7374a0e9975d395357c1a9da9a0bc7bdc069bf7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4138679613,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs72rz09","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PANDAS%20API%20ON%20SPARK","name":"PANDAS

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nBackport of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/42667 to branch-3.4.\r\n\r\nThe PR improves JSON parsing when `spark.sql.json.enablePartialResults` is enabled:\r\n- Fixes the issue when using nested arrays `ClassCastException: org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.util.GenericArrayData cannot be cast to org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.InternalRow`\r\n- Improves parsing of the nested struct fields, e.g. `{\"a1\": \"AAA\", \"a2\": [{\"f1\": \"\", \"f2\": \"\"}], \"a3\": \"id1\", \"a4\": \"XXX\"}` used to be parsed as `|AAA|NULL    |NULL|NULL|` and now is parsed as `|AAA|[{NULL, }]|id1|XXX|`.\r\n- Improves performance of nested JSON parsing. The initial implementation would throw too many exceptions when multiple nested fields failed to parse. When the config is disabled, it is not a problem because the entire record is marked as NULL.\r\n\r\nThe internal benchmarks show the performance improvement from slowdown of over 160% to an improvement of 7-8% compared to the master branch when the flag is enabled. I will create a follow-up ticket to add a benchmark for this regression.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFixes some corner cases in JSON parsing and improves performance when `spark.sql.json.enablePartialResults` is enabled.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI added tests to verify nested structs, maps, and arrays can be parsed without affecting the subsequent fields in the JSON. I also updated the existing tests when `spark.sql.json.enablePartialResults` is enabled because we parse more data now.\r\n\r\nI added a benchmark to check performance.\r\n\r\nBefore the change

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nBackport of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/42667 to branch-3.5.\r\n\r\nThe PR improves JSON parsing when `spark.sql.json.enablePartialResults` is enabled:\r\n- Fixes the issue when using nested arrays `ClassCastException: org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.util.GenericArrayData cannot be cast to org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.InternalRow`\r\n- Improves parsing of the nested struct fields, e.g. `{\"a1\": \"AAA\", \"a2\": [{\"f1\": \"\", \"f2\": \"\"}], \"a3\": \"id1\", \"a4\": \"XXX\"}` used to be parsed as `|AAA|NULL    |NULL|NULL|` and now is parsed as `|AAA|[{NULL, }]|id1|XXX|`.\r\n- Improves performance of nested JSON parsing. The initial implementation would throw too many exceptions when multiple nested fields failed to parse. When the config is disabled, it is not a problem because the entire record is marked as NULL.\r\n\r\nThe internal benchmarks show the performance improvement from slowdown of over 160% to an improvement of 7-8% compared to the master branch when the flag is enabled. I will create a follow-up ticket to add a benchmark for this regression.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFixes some corner cases in JSON parsing and improves performance when `spark.sql.json.enablePartialResults` is enabled.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI added tests to verify nested structs, maps, and arrays can be parsed without affecting the subsequent fields in the JSON. I also updated the existing tests when `spark.sql.json.enablePartialResults` is enabled because we parse more data now.\r\n\r\nI added a benchmark to check performance.\r\n\r\nBefore the change

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR added warning messages throughout the Pandas API on Spark wherever the `numeric_only` parameter is used with different default value.\r\n\r\nThis is to inform users of the different default behavior in Pandas API on Spark compared to traditional Pandas.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe default behavior of the `numeric_only` parameter in Pandas API on Spark is different from Pandas 2.x.x due to the inability to support mixed data types in a single column.\r\n\r\nThis could potentially lead to unexpected results for users unfamiliar with this distinction. By providing a clear warning message, we aim to prevent confusion and potential mistakes.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. Users will now see a warning message when they use functions or methods that involve the `numeric_only` parameter without explicitly setting it. This message informs them of the different default behaviors between Pandas API on Spark and traditional Pandas.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> psdf = ps.DataFrame({\"A\": [1, 2, 3], \"B\": ['a', 'b', 'c']})\r\n>>> psdf.cov()\r\n/.../spark/python/pyspark/pandas/utils.py:1016: PandasAPIOnSparkAdviceWarning: In Pandas API on Spark, the 'numeric_only' parameter defaults to 'True' if not set, due to the inability to mix different data types in a single column in Spark. This behavior might differ from the traditional Pandas behavior where 'numeric_only' defaults to 'False'. Please ensure to set this parameter explicitly to avoid unexpected results.\r\n  warnings.warn(message, PandasAPIOnSparkAdviceWarning)\r\n     A\r\nA  1.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nManually tested. The existing CI should pass.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to fix the behavior of `MultiIndex.append` to do not checking names.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo match the behavior with pandas according to https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/pull/48288\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, the behavior is changed to match with pandas:\r\n\r\n**Testing data**\r\n```python\r\n>>> psmidx1\r\nMultiIndex([('a', 'x', 1),\r\n            ('b', 'y', 2),\r\n            ('c', 'z', 3)],\r\n           names=['x', 'y', 'z'])\r\n>>> psmidx2\r\nMultiIndex([('a', 'x', 1),\r\n            ('b', 'y', 2),\r\n            ('c', 'z', 3)],\r\n           names=['p', 'q',

    ('b', 'y', 2),\r\n            ('c', 'z', 3),\r\n            ('a', 'x', 1),\r\n            ('b', 'y', 2),\r\n            ('c', 'z', 3)],\r\n           )\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nFix the existing UTs.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a backport of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/42784.\r\n\r\nFixes Arrow-optimized Python UDF to delay wrapping the function with `fail_on_stopiteration`.\r\n\r\nAlso removed unnecessary verification `verify_result_type`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFor Arrow-optimized Python UDF, `fail_on_stopiteration` can be applied to only the wrapped function to avoid unnecessary overhead.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded the related test.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2023-09-04T01:58:42Z","updated_at":"2023-09-04T07:26:13Z","closed_at":"2023-09-04T07:26:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bdcf7ce558108e262a16348d3f7f136ba5cdcab7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42785/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42785/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/42785/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7cc0f5a426641c9e78200a7d9c215c2ec4d4407e","head":{"label":"ueshin:issues/SPARK-44876/3.5/fail_on_stopiteration","ref":"issues/SPARK-44876/3.5/fail_on_stopiteration","sha":"7cc0f5a426641c9e78200a7d9c215c2ec4d4407e","user":{"login":"ueshin","id":506656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin","html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17234665,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzNDY2NQ==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"ueshin/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ueshin","id":506656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin","html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCall `restorePartitionMetadata` in `listPartitions` to restore Spark SQL statistics.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently when `listPartitions` is called, it doesn't restore Spark SQL statistics stored in metastore, such as `spark.sql.statistics.totalSize`. This means callers who rely on stats from the method call may wrong results.\r\n\r\nIn particular, when `spark.sql.statistics.size.autoUpdate.enabled` is turned on, during insert overwrite Spark will first list partitions and get old statistics, and then compare them with new statistics and see which partitions need to be updated. This issue will sometimes cause it to update all partitions instead of only those partitions that have been touched.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded a new test.\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nfor SQL function aliases (with `setAlias=true`) added in 3.5, replace expression construction with `call_function` to make the output column name consistent with SQL\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n\r\n1. we still have multiple similar cases added in other versions, this PR mainly focus on 3.5 to make it easy to backport if needed;\r\n2. not all function aliases have the issue (e.g. `current_schema`), to be conservative, I change them all;\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nbefore this PR\r\n\r\n```\r\nscala> val df = spark.range(0,

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to revert back the behavior of idle progress for StreamingQuery API from [SPARK-43183](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-43183), to avoid breakage of tests from 3rd party data sources.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWe indicated that the behavioral change from SPARK-43183 broke many tests in 3rd party data sources.\r\n(Short summary of SPARK-43183: we changed the behavior of idle progress to only provide idle event callback, instead of making progress update callback as well as adding progress for StreamingQuery API to provide as recent progresses/last progress.)\r\n\r\nThe main rationale of SPARK-43183 was to avoid making progress update callback for idle event, which had been confused users. That is more about streaming query listener, and not necessarily had to change the behavior of StreamingQuery API as well.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, but the user-facing change is technically reduced before this PR, as we revert back the behavioral change partially from SPARK-43183, which wasn't released yet. \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nModified tests. Also manually ran 3rd party data source tests which were broken with Spark 3.5.0 RC which succeeded with this change.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2023-09-01T14:03:15Z","updated_at":"2023-09-04T02:43:07Z","closed_at":"2023-09-04T02:43:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f4386aed7a32c094d584e4a11fa4e4cb74d0b08a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to revert back the behavior of idle progress for StreamingQuery API from [SPARK-43183](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-43183), to avoid breakage of tests from 3rd party data sources.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWe indicated that the behavioral change from SPARK-43183 broke many tests in 3rd party data sources.\r\n(Short summary of SPARK-43183: we changed the behavior of idle progress to only provide idle event callback, instead of making progress update callback as well as adding progress for StreamingQuery API to provide as recent progresses/last progress.)\r\n\r\nThe main rationale of SPARK-43183 was to avoid making progress update callback for idle event, which had been confused users. That is more about streaming query listener, and not necessarily had to change the behavior of StreamingQuery API as well.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, but the user-facing change is technically reduced before this PR, as we revert back the behavioral change partially from SPARK-43183, which wasn't released yet. \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nModified tests. Also manually ran 3rd party data source tests which were broken with Spark 3.5.0 RC which succeeded with this change.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2023-09-01T13:49:31Z","updated_at":"2023-09-04T02:45:45Z","closed_at":"2023-09-04T02:41:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"41e3f32334e7e3f9acdca48726082fd3400a9f8f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis changes the default operations ID format from UUIDv4 to UUIDv7. This is done on the server and on the client side (both Scala and Python) since both sides can set this ID first.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSpark Connect currently uses UUIDv4 for operation IDs. Using UUIDv7 instead allows us to sort operations by ID to receive a chronological order while keeping the collision-free properties we require from this ID.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2023-09-01T12:36:57Z","updated_at":"2023-09-05T17:37:11Z","closed_at":"2023-09-05T17:37:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"080b8a158cfa334200d479add17907c991cd9ab1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1982110661,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMTEwNjYx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/INFRA","name":"INFRA","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42772/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42772/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/42772/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/58486fd65d802d2e2d411be75978b4325154f2d8","head":{"label":"dillitz:SPARK-45051-uuid7-operation-id","ref":"SPARK-45051-uuid7-operation-id","sha":"58486fd65d802d2e2d411be75978b4325154f2d8","user":{"login":"dillitz","id":135709731,"node_id":"U_kgDOCBbEIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/135709731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz","html_url":"https://github.com/dillitz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":661600404,"node_id":"R_kgDOJ284lA","name":"spark","full_name":"dillitz/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dillitz","id":135709731,"node_id":"U_kgDOCBbEIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/135709731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz","html_url":"https://github.com/dillitz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dillitz/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr aims to set `shadeTestJar` of `core` module to `false` to skip shade `spark-core**-tests.jar` process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nBefore SPARK-41244, the core module used the `maven-shade-plugin` configuration in the `parent pom.xml` for shading, where the `shadeTestJar` configuration item was set to the default `false` in the `maven-shade-plugin` in `parent pom.xml`.\r\n\r\nIn SPARK-41244 | SPARK-41244 https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/38779, the core module started using a separate `maven-shade-plugin` configuration and set the `shadeTestJar` configuration item to `true`.\r\n\r\nAnd when `shadeTestJar` is true, `maven-shade-plugin` always try to find(sometime is downloading) some non-existent jars:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[INFO] --- maven-shade-plugin:3.5.0:shade (default) @ spark-core_2.12 ---\r\n[INFO] Including org.eclipse.jetty:jetty-plus:jar:9.4.51.v20230217 in the shaded

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIn SPJ, currently the logic to handle partially clustered distribution is a bit complicated. For instance, when the feature is eanbled (by enabling both `conf.v2BucketingPushPartValuesEnabled` and `conf.v2BucketingPartiallyClusteredDistributionEnabled`), Spark should postpone the combining of input splits until it is about to create an input RDD in `BatchScanExec`. To implement this, `groupPartitions` in `DataSourceV2ScanExecBase` currently takes the flag as input and has two different behaviors, which could be confusing.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new field in `KeyGroupedPartitioning`, named `originalPartitionValues`, that is used to store the original partition values from input before splits combining  has been applied. The field is used when partially clustered distribution is enabled. With this, `groupPartitions` becomes easier to understand.\r\n\r\nIn addition, this also simplifies `BatchScanExec.inputRDD` by combining two branches where partially clustered distribution is not enabled.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTo simplify the current logic in the SPJ w.r.t partially clustered distribution.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR adds a new optional argument to the `mode` aggregate function to provide deterministic results. When multiple values have the same greatest frequency then the new boolean argument can be used to get the lowest or highest value instead of an arbitraty one.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo make the function more user friendly.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, it adds a new argument to the `mode` function.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new UTs.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nMove the arrow batch creation to the `isCommand` branch\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/42736 and https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/42743 introduced the `CalendarIntervalType` in Spark Connect Python Client, however, there is a failure\r\n\r\n```\r\nspark.sql(\"SELECT make_interval(100, 11, 1, 1, 12, 30, 01.001001)\")\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\npyspark.errors.exceptions.connect.UnsupportedOperationException: [UNSUPPORTED_DATATYPE] Unsupported data type \"INTERVAL\".\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe root causes is that `handleSqlCommand` always create an arrow batch while `ArrowUtils` doesn't accept `CalendarIntervalType` now.\r\n\r\nthis PR mainly focus on enabling `schema` with datatypes not compatible with arrow.\r\nIn the future, we should make `ArrowUtils` accept `CalendarIntervalType` to make `collect/toPandas` works\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nyes\r\n\r\nafter this PR\r\n```\r\nIn [1]: spark.sql(\"SELECT make_interval(100, 11, 1, 1, 12, 30, 01.001001)\")\r\nOut[1]: DataFrame[make_interval(100,
