PR addresses the following changes:\r\n\r\n1. Write a file from path to Azure Blob storage (WASBS)\r\n2. Write a file from text to Azure Blob storage (WASBS)\r\n3. Allow for kwargs to be passed into the WasbHook constructor\r\n\r\nWe need the ability to write back to Blob storage and this covers a missing gap in this hook.\r\n\r\nRegarding the kwargs, we require the AirFlow pipelines to be generalizable at runtime, and this cannot be done without an existing connection made that authorizes the connection. This fix provides an alternative way to provide access. We prefer these connections to be ephemeral in nature, and not stored for longtime, and we can do this when executing a workload.\r\n\r\nIt should also be noted that these credentials should not be stored in the DAG itself but passed in as a property, such as a SAS Token.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

the user folder (`~/.local/lib/python3.7/...`) and both be importable.\r\n\r\nIf we didn't have code in `airflow/__init__.py` this would be much easier to achieve (we simply delete the top level init file would be enough) - but sadly we can't take that route.\r\n\r\nFrom the docs of pkgutil: https://docs.python.org/3/library/pkgutil.html#module-pkgutil\r\n\r\n> This will add to the package’s __path__ all subdirectories of\r\n> directories on sys.path named after the package. This is useful if one\r\n> wants to distribute different parts of a single logical package as\r\n> multiple directories.\r\n\r\nTested as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Edit setup.py to `exclude=airflow.providers*'`\r\n$ pip install /wheels/apache_airflow-2.0.0.dev0-py3-none-any.whl\r\n\r\n# Verify it wasn't istalled.\r\n$ ls -ald $(python -c 'import os; print(os.path.dirname(__import__(\"airflow\").__file__))')/providers\r\nls: cannot access '/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/airflow/providers': No such file or directory\r\n\r\n# Install some provider packages.\r\n$ pip install --constraint <(echo 'apache-airflow==2.0.0.dev0') apache-airflow-backport-providers-redis\r\n$ pip install --user --constraint <(echo 'apache-airflow==2.0.0.dev0') apache-airflow-backport-providers-imap\r\n\r\n# See where they are imported from\r\n$ python -c 'import airflow.providers.imap, airflow.providers.redis; print(airflow.providers.imap.__file__); print(airflow.providers.redis.__file__)'\r\n/root/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/airflow/providers/imap/__init__.py\r\n/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/airflow/providers/redis/__init__.py\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

`list_prefixes` and `list_keys` methods of the s3 hook return lists if the result isn't empty, and `None` otherwise. Some operators that use these methods break when the result is empty, because they expect to receive a list and not `None`. We could change the operators to handle `None`, but I think it makes more sense to return an empty list when the prefix or key list is empty instead. This matches the behavior of the aws sdk, and I think an empty list is a more reasonable return value than `None` if no prefixes or keys match the query.","created_at":"2020-09-07T01:28:30Z","updated_at":"2020-09-08T07:49:35Z","closed_at":"2020-09-08T07:49:35Z","merged_at":"2020-09-08T07:49:35Z","merge_commit_sha":"2934220dc98e295764f7791d33e121629ed2fbbb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1471852032,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDcxODUyMDMy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:amazon","name":"provider:amazon","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"AWS/Amazon

observed the tests for last couple of weeks and it seems\r\nmost of the tests marked with \"quarantine\" marker are succeeding\r\nin a stable way (#10118)\r\nThe removed tests have success ratio of > 95% (20 runs without\r\nproblems) and this has been verified a week ago as well,\r\nso it seems they are rather stable.\r\n\r\nThere are literally few that are either failing or causing\r\nthe Quarantined builds to hang. I manually reviewed the\r\nmaster tests that failed for last few weeks and added the\r\ntests that are causing the build to hang.\r\n\r\nSeems that stability has improved - which might be casued\r\nby some temporary problems when we marked the quarantined builds\r\nor too \"generous\" way of marking test as quarantined, or\r\nmaybe improvement comes from the #10368 as the docker engine\r\nand machines used to run the builds in GitHub experience far\r\nless load (image builds are executed in separate builds) so\r\nit might be that resource usage is decreased. Another reason\r\nmight be Github Actions stability improvements.\r\n\r\nOr simply those tests are more stable when run isolation.\r\n\r\nWe might still add failing tests back as soon we see them behave\r\nin a flaky way.\r\n\r\nThe remaining quarantined tests that need to be fixed:\r\n * test_local_run (often hangs the build)\r\n * test_retry_handling_job\r\n * test_clear_multiple_external_task_marker\r\n * test_should_force_kill_process\r\n\r\nWe also move some of those tests to \"heisentests\" category\r\nThose testst run fine in isolation but fail\r\nthe builds when run with all other tests:\r\n * test_change_state_for_tis_without_dagrun\r\n * test_cli_webserver_background\r\n * TestImpersonation tests\r\n\r\nWe might find that those heisentest can be fixed but for\r\nnow we are going to run them in isolation.\r\n\r\nAlso - since those quarantined tests are failing more often\r\nthe \"num runs\" to track for those has been decreased to 10\r\nto keep track of 10 last runs only.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

docker(), helm(), kubectl() functions replace the real tools\r\nto get verbose behaviour (we can print the exact command being\r\nexecuted for those. But when 'set +e' was set before the command\r\nwas called - indicating that error in those functions should be\r\nignored - this did not happen. The functions set 'set -e' just\r\nbefore returning the non-zero value, effectively exiting the\r\nscript right after. This caused first time experience to be not\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nThe fix also fixes behaviour of stdout and stderr for those\r\nfunctions - previously they were joined to be able to be\r\nprinted to OUTPUT_FILE but this lost the stderr/stdout\r\ndistinction. Now both stdout and stderr are printed to the\r\noutput file but they are also redirected to stdout/stderr\r\nrespectively, so that 2>/dev/null works as expected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add

`@provide_session` wrapper will already commit the transaction when returned, unless an explicit session is passed in -- removing this parameter changes the behaviour to be:\n\n- If session explicitly passed in: don't commit (caller's responsibility)\n- If no session passed in, `@provide_session` will commit for us already.\n\n(This is prep work for scheduler HA, where we need to be more careful about when exactly we commit session, as we use 'SELECT ...

is re-applied commit from reverted one - the sequence of trap\r\nhandling scripts were wrong so after add_trap was fixed the folder\r\nwas deleted before output was printed out]\r\n\r\nFirst (and the biggest of the series of commits to introduce\r\nGoogle Shell Conventions in our bash scripts.\r\n\r\nThis is about the biggest and the most complex breeze script\r\nso it is rather huge but it is difficult to split it into\r\nsmaller pieces.\r\n\r\nThe rules implemented (from the conventions):\r\n\r\n * constants and exported variables are CAPITALIZED, where\r\n   local/temporary variables are lowercase\r\n\r\n * following the shell guide, once all the variables are set to their\r\n   final values (either from exported variables, calculation or --switches\r\n   ) I have a single function that makes all the variables read-only. That\r\n   helped to clean-up a lot of places where same functions was called\r\n   several times, or where variables were defined in a few places. Now the\r\n   behavior should be rather consistent and we should easily catch some\r\n   duplications\r\n\r\n * function headers (following the guide) explaining arguments,\r\n   variables expected, variables modified in the functions used.\r\n\r\n * setting the variables as read-only also helped to clean-up the \"ifs\"\r\n   where we often had \":=}\" in variables and != \"\" or == \"\". Those are\r\n   replaced with `=}` and tests are replaced with `-n` and `-z` - also\r\n   following the shell guide (readonly helped to detect and clean all\r\n   such cases). This also should be much more robust in the future.\r\n\r\n * reorganized initialization of those constants and variables - simplified\r\n   a few places where initialization was overlapping. It should be much more\r\n   straightforward and clean now\r\n\r\n * a number of internal function breeze variables are \"local\" - this is\r\n   helpful in accidental variables overwriting and keeping stuff localized\r\n\r\n * trap_add function is separated out to help in cases where we had\r\n   several traps handling the same signals.\r\n\r\n(cherry picked from commit 46c8d67)\r\n(cherry picked from commit c822fd7b4bf2a9c5a9bb3c6e783cbea9dac37246)\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

PR fixes a bug in the definition of `statsd` container in helm-chart. \r\n\r\nWith current master helm-chart the `airflow-statsd` pod fails and collecting logs from the pod with `kubectl logs` returns the message:\r\n\r\n`statsd_exporter: error: unknown short flag '-s', try --help`\r\n\r\nFollowing the suggestion from https://github.com/prometheus/statsd_exporter/issues/155, I have added additional dash to `-statsd.mapping-config` flag in the definition of `statsd` container inside `statsd-deployment.yaml` file, which seems to fix the pod.\r\n\r\n---\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before
