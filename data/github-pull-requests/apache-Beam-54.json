[#26316](https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/26316).\r\n\r\nIn situations where there are nullable fields in an avro ocf file, previously a previous row's non-null value for a given column would be passed into a pcollection for a subsequent datum if that column was null.\r\n\r\nAdded a new test case to check for this, which failed using the previous logic.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the previous avroio package was using a legacy version (2.1.0) which is ~3-4+ years old. Upgraded to the latest goavro/v2 version. \r\n\r\nAmongst other bug fixes, this release of goavro is ~3-4x faster than the previous version (as documented on the goavro github [page](https://github.com/linkedin/goavro#major-improvements-in-v2-over-v1).)\r\n\r\nI am not 100% sure if there are additional dependencies to the previous goavro package which I do not understand, in which case this PR can be scoped to solely the bug fix mentioned above as an alternative.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

processing transforms. TFTProcessHandler uses tensorflow_transform's beam implementation for computing results. \r\n\r\nThis PR aims to provide a simple to use API which abstracts the user away from the complexities that one can find with using tensorflow transform such as providing a tensorflow feature spec etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Not considered/implemented in this PR\r\n## Alternative design -  Alternative way to pass columns to the transforms\r\n\r\nInstead of passing columns to the every data transform, we can let MLTransform take a param `columns` and assume that all the data transforms within the scope of that MLTransform are applicable only on the input `columns` passed.\r\n\r\nBut this could have a downside if the user calls multple `MLTransform`s, then there will be fusion break(due to tft internal implementation)\r\n\r\n```\r\n with beam.Pipeline() as p:\r\n      transforms = [ComputeAndApplyVocab(...), TFIDF(...)]\r\n      result = (\r\n          p\r\n          | \"Create\" >> beam.Create(input_data)\r\n          | beam.Map(lambda x: ComputeAndVocabBatchedInputType(**x)\r\n                     ).with_output_types(ComputeAndVocabBatchedInputType)\r\n          | \"MLTransform\" >>\r\n          base.MLTransform(columns=['x'], transforms=transforms)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

and fit & finish work for Go SDK timers. \r\n\r\n* Adds a timers.Context for providing the Family & Tag fields.\r\n* Adds a ClearTag method to EventTime and ProcessingTime timers to support clearing a timer for a specific tag.\r\n* Updates the timer_wordcap example\r\n  * Use a finite Periodic sequence to get elements.\r\n  * Demonstrate element batching with State & Timers.\r\n  * Add verbose logging to clarify execution for example purposes.\r\n  * Demonstrate multiple tags set for the same timer.\r\n* Simplifies user key coderID sourcing by moving it entirely to pipeline serialization time.\r\n  * Current Beam model is more general on timer key and window coders, but they are implicitly associated directly with the DoFn's parallel input key.\r\n* Fetches coders at execution time from the bundle descriptors returned timer_family_spec.\r\n  * This avoids relying on the previous implementation detail, while also allowing the runner to replace the user key coder as needed, such as to add length prefixes or similar.\r\n* Handle inserted timers similarly to [Java SDK](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/f154d0165d31068f9e0d2ae008d7823dcf4cf53a/sdks/java/harness/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/fn/harness/FnApiDoFnRunner.java#L1667-L1734) allowing for quickly re-looping timers when applicable.\r\n  * Supporting this is the bulk of the PRs complexity, but ordering is required for correctness and avoiding double firing.\r\n* Ensure keys are not repeatedly encoded/decoded for a given inline process.\r\n  * Key bytes on fired timers are re-used when writing new timers. \r\n* Removes unnecessary UserTimerAdapter interface, as all uses are in the exec package.\r\n* Ensures all timers from a given timer batch are parsed.\r\n* Since they don't have mutable state, made timers.ProcessingTime and timers.EventTime have value receivers instead of pointer receivers.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Users who supply  custom containers  may run into errors when `python3-venv` is not installed, and need to install it separately, which is inconvenient.\r\n\r\nCreating a venv is not strictly required, therefore we can fallback on prior behavior to use global environment. \r\n\r\nDrive-by changes:\r\n - Log why creating a venv didn't succeed.\r\n - Provide an way to disable venv creation, which may benefit users who wish to re-use a precreated virtual environment on their image.  To disable creating isolated venvs, users can add the following line to their Dockerfiles: \r\n  `ENV RUN_PYTHON_SDK_IN_DEFAULT_ENVIRONMENT=1`\r\n \r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Beam 2.37.0 ([BEAM-13203](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-13203)) `SnsIO.writeAsync` was deprecated, the implementation is wrong and risks losing data.

by an upcoming (but ultimately reverted) change to Go for 1.21, where these checks were doing something that worked, but were misusing the reflect APIs to achieve it. Fixing this avoids relying on a brittle implementation detail.\r\n\r\n`reflect.Type` is safe to use as a map key, so looking up the pointer identifier for the specific type instance isn't necessary. This worked before because the reflect package caches Type instances, and reuses the same one for the same type, leading to the same behavior.\r\n\r\nThe pattern was only used in coder/registry.go and for checking concrete types in typex/class.go.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

initialization of FileSystems through `FileSystems.setDefaultPipelineOptions` is problematic and prone to race conditions, especially when triggered on deserialization of `SerializablePipelineOptions` (see #18430, [BEAM-14465](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-14465), [BEAM-14355](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-14355)).\r\n\r\nParticularly with `S3FileSystem` this is bad as it can easily leak resources (threads!) if used this way (see #26321).\r\n\r\n### Observations\r\n- Removing `FileSystems.setDefaultPipelineOptions` from deserialization in SerializablePipelineOptions (#18430) is unlikely to happen any time soon as it requires a coordinated push across various runners and it’s not obvious where and when initialization is supposed to happen for each runner. As a consequence we must expect `FileSystems.setDefaultPipelineOptions` to be called any number of times.\r\n- Looking into previous related issues ([BEAM-14465](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-14465), [BEAM-14355](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-14355)), logs give a clear hint how often the file systems got re-initialized. The logs mentioned in the tickets happen(ed) once per initialization of the S3 FS:  In the case of the Go Flink integration tests that was almost 80k times, running Python wordcount on Beam it was happening > 600 times.\r\n- I spend quite some time investigating if Pipeline options could be locked during execution. That requires a lot of effort changing runners, but that part is possible. However, test cases strongly suggest being able to mutate pipeline options while running is an intended feature. \r\n\r\n### Changes in this PR\r\n\r\n- Extend pipeline options to track a monotonically increasing revision with each update.\r\n- Change the initialization of file systems to be idempotent by means of that revision. Additionally this is scoped to a particular pipeline using the options id.\r\n\r\nCloses #27535, fixes #26321\r\n\r\n(cc @robertwb Thanks for your reply on the email thread)\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

<code>v0.20.0</code>. Due to an unintended error, the git tags associated with <code>v0.20.0</code> were created in an inconsistent state. As a result, the tags were removed and recreated to accurately reflect the intended release state. This situation could have affected users relying on the Go proxy cache during the short time window between the initial release and the tag correction.</p>\n<p>To address this issue, we have now created the patch release <a href=\"https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-go/releases/v0.20.1\"><code>v0.20.1</code></a>, which is based on the correct state of the project and provides a seamless transition from <code>v0.20.0</code>.</p>\n<p>To ensure that you have the latest updates, we recommend updating your dependencies to use <a href=\"https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-go/releases/v0.20.1\"><code>v0.20.1</code></a> instead of <code>v0.20.0</code> to ensure you have the correct and stable version.</p>\n<p>We apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate your understanding. If you have any questions or encounter any issues, please don't hesitate to reach out to us.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your continued support!</p>\n<h1>What's Changed</h1>\n<h2>⚠️ Breaking Changes</h2>\n<p>The signature of the <code>testcontainers.NewDockerClient</code> has changed in order to provide a simpler API for the future changes, and for that reason we were forced to break it and simplify its signature, returning the client and an error, instead of an instance of the Testcontainers properties and the host. At the same time, the <code>TestContainersConfig</code> struct representing the configuration properties has been renamed to <code>TestcontainersConfig</code>, which is brings consistency with the name of the project.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>break: disable reaper at config level (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-go/issues/941\">#941</a>) <a href=\"https://github.com/mdelapenya\"><code>@​mdelapenya</code></a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>🚀 Features</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>feat: Add Redpanda module (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-go/issues/1058\">#1058</a>) <a href=\"https://github.com/weeco\"><code>@​weeco</code></a></li>\n<li>feat: Add ability to disable internal checks for <code>wait.HostPortStrategy</code> (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-go/issues/1039\">#1039</a>) <a href=\"https://github.com/RiverPhillips\"><code>@​RiverPhillips</code></a></li>\n<li>feat: use an interface for container customization in modules (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-go/issues/1042\">#1042</a>) <a href=\"https://github.com/mdelapenya\"><code>@​mdelapenya</code></a></li>\n<li>Add support for LocalStack v2 (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-go/issues/994\">#994</a>) <a href=\"https://github.com/eddumelendez\"><code>@​eddumelendez</code></a></li>\n<li>feat: provide container lifecycle hooks (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-go/issues/1036\">#1036</a>) <a href=\"https://github.com/mdelapenya\"><code>@​mdelapenya</code></a></li>\n<li>feat: support for wait.ForExec with response matcher (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-go/issues/1035\">#1035</a>) <a href=\"https://github.com/mdelapenya\"><code>@​mdelapenya</code></a></li>\n<li>feat: building blocks for Go modules (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-go/issues/1016\">#1016</a>) <a href=\"https://github.com/mdelapenya\"><code>@​mdelapenya</code></a></li>\n<li>feat: add Redis module (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-go/issues/993\">#993</a>) <a href=\"https://github.com/mdelapenya\"><code>@​mdelapenya</code></a></li>\n<li>feat: Auto detect the use of Podman from DOCKER_HOST (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-go/issues/982\">#982</a>) <a href=\"https://github.com/jtwatson\"><code>@​jtwatson</code></a></li>\n<li>feat: add Neo4j module (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-go/issues/937\">#937</a>) <a href=\"https://github.com/fbiville\"><code>@​fbiville</code></a></li>\n<li>Add MySQL module (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-go/issues/943\">#943</a>) <a href=\"https://github.com/eddumelendez\"><code>@​eddumelendez</code></a></li>\n<li>feat: add Vault Module (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-go/issues/942\">#942</a>) <a href=\"https://github.com/alihanyalcin\"><code>@​alihanyalcin</code></a></li>\n<li>feat: add Postgres module (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-go/issues/945\">#945</a>) <a href=\"https://github.com/mdelapenya\"><code>@​mdelapenya</code></a></li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...
