If it is not obvious which project to add issues to, you are always welcome to report any issue at <a href=\"https://github.com/vaadin/platform/issues\">https://github.com/vaadin/platform/issues</a>.</p>\n<p>A few rules of thumb will help you and us in finding the correct repository for the issue:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If you encounter an issue when using the HTML/JS API of a component or the component renders incorrectly, the problem is likely in the web component. The web component repositories are named like <a href=\"https://github.com/vaadin/vaadin-button\">https://github.com/vaadin/vaadin-button</a></li>\n<li>If you encounter an issue when using the Java API of a component, the problem is likely in the Flow integration of the web component. The Flow component integration repositories are named like <a href=\"https://github.com/vaadin/vaadin-button-flow\">https://github.com/vaadin/vaadin-button-flow</a></li>\n<li>If you encounter an issue with Flow which does not seem to be related to a specific component, the problem is likely in Flow itself. The Flow repository is <a href=\"https://github.com/vaadin/flow\">https://github.com/vaadin/flow</a></li>\n<li>If you encounter an issue with Designer, the repository is <a href=\"https://github.com/vaadin/designer\">https://github.com/vaadin/designer</a></li>\n<li>If you encounter an issue with TestBench, the repository is <a href=\"https://github.com/vaadin/testbench\">https://github.com/vaadin/testbench</a></li>\n</ol>\n<h1>Vaadin 16.0.4</h1>\n<p>Vaadin consists of a set of web components, a Java web framework, configurable themes, tools and a set of app templates.</p>\n<p>This is a maintenance release of Vaadin.\nSee the full release notes for Vaadin 16.0 in <a href=\"https://github.com/vaadin/platform/releases/tag/16.0.0\">GitHub releases</a>, including new features, getting started, supported browsers and other technologies, and migration notes.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

(0cb89dd110)</li>\n<li><code>cache</code>: Fixed memory leak in <code>LocalCache</code> under <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/j2objc\">j2objc</a>. (5e519d91d0)</li>\n<li><code>collect</code>: Added two-element <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> methods to <code>Comparators</code>. (958186c071)</li>\n<li><code>collect</code>: Removed <code>@Beta</code> from <code>Multimaps.toMultimap</code>. (b6b4dc49b1)</li>\n<li><code>collect</code>: Made the set returned by <code>ImmutableMap&lt;K, V&gt;.keySet()</code> serializable as long as <code>K</code> is serializable, even if <code>V</code> is not (and similarly for <code>values()</code>). (f5a69c33fc)</li>\n<li><code>collect</code>: Fixed bug in <code>powerSet.equals(otherPowerSet)</code> would erroneously return <code>false</code> if the two power sets' underlying sets were equal but had a different iteration order. (215b1f0dd7)</li>\n<li><code>collect</code>: Eliminated <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/j2objc\">j2objc</a> retain-cycle in <code>SingletonImmutableBiMap</code>. (0ad38b88bd)</li>\n<li><code>eventbus</code>: Prevented <code>@Subscribe</code> from being applied to a method that takes a primitive, as that will never be called. (554546c971)</li>\n<li><code>graph</code>: Made <code>Traverser.breadthFirst()</code> lazier, and optimized <code>Traverser</code> more generally. (32f2d770f7, b5210ca95c)</li>\n<li><code>graph</code>: Added <code>@DoNotMock</code> to <code>Traverser</code>. (6410f18c06)</li>\n<li><code>io</code>: Deprecated <code>Files.createTempDir()</code>. (fec0dbc463) (CVE forthcoming)</li>\n<li><del><code>io</code>: Upgraded <code>ByteStreams.copy(InputStream, OutputStream)</code> to use the faster <code>FileChannel</code> if possible.

(bee4f3c7ed, 2b5c096ddf, 633abf2c62)</li>\n<li><code>net</code>: Added <code>MediaType</code> constants for several font/ types. (571cf66bac)</li>\n<li><code>net</code>: Added <code>HttpHeaders</code> constants for <code>Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy(-Report-Only)?</code>. (c3bf73187a)</li>\n<li><code>testing</code>: Made <code>EqualsTester</code> test that non-<code>String</code> objects are not equal to their <code>String</code> representations. (c9570eae69)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Added <code>ClosingFuture</code>. (52e048ed6c)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Removed the deprecated 1-arg <code>ServiceManager.addListener(Listener)</code>.

It should be backward compatible in most cases.
