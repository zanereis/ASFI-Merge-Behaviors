of the main advantages of using AWS Secrets Manager is its ability to automatically create secrets of RDS databases and Redshift databases. Those secrets consist of several keys with their values, i.e user, pass, etc. Also, it is normal to store API Keys, sftp, or whatever using different values, as shown in the picture below:\r\n![Captura de pantalla 2020-05-22 a las 10 41 07](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11339132/82648933-c23ac100-9c18-11ea-9f7c-6a36d0333bbe.png)\r\n\r\nWith the current code, all the keys and values obtained from a secret are stored in the schema attribute of the conn object, unless you have just one key with the conn_uri in the value. Thus, the current situation is forcing to use Secrets Manager in a way it is not intended to.\r\n\r\nWith this proposed modification, you can use AWS Secrets Manager using keys and values and have some kind of freedom to choose different words for each key to make the get_conn work.\r\n\r\nThird attempt. Coming from here: https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/15104\r\n@xinbinhuang I have tried to implement all your suggestions (thanks!) but regarding https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/15104#discussion_r606090823 I received an error that Connection could not be imported. Maybe it is because I am using the secrets backend replacing the original file with a COPY in the Dockerfile, I dunno\r\n@ dstandish Regarding https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/15104#issuecomment-812596462, I like your suggestion but I would rather keep the code as it is now. It's been a while since my first pull request for this (more than a year https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/9008) and I want to have it merge

PR #17284 \r\n### **Issue:**\r\nCurrently Google Cloud Transfer Service operators `CloudDataTransferServiceGCSToGCSOperator` and `CloudDataTransferServiceS3ToGCSOperator` don't provide functionality to specify destination path, i.e. prefix for transferred objects, hence all the objects should simply land into the root of the bucket.  \r\n\r\n### **Solution:**\r\n[The Storage Transfer Service allows to specify prefix for transferred objects](https://cloud.google.com/storage-transfer/docs/reference/rest/v1/TransferSpec#GcsData), the PR adds this functionality with a new input parameter for operators above.\r\n\r\nBy default it'd be `None`, so transferred objects will still land into the root of a bucket.\r\n\r\nIdeally I'd like to use just a single input parameter for specifying destination location, similar as it's done for [`S3ToGCSOperator`](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/providers/google/cloud/transfers/s3_to_gcs.py), parsing GCS URL, but it'd break backward compatibility for already existing pipelines. Hence, adding a new input parameter seems a more reasonable solution.","created_at":"2021-08-05T14:07:29Z","updated_at":"2021-10-30T15:51:25Z","closed_at":"2021-10-30T15:47:14Z","merged_at":"2021-10-30T15:47:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"a3c9956f79310b529a79c1e43fb881c5e173d321","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"turbaszek","id":9528307,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjgzMDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9528307?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek","html_url":"https://github.com/turbaszek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1463392518,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDYzMzkyNTE4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:google","name":"provider:google","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"Google

was a change in #16521 that introduced schema field in\r\nDBApiHook, but unfortunately using it in provider Hooks deriving\r\nfrom DBApiHook is backwards incompatible for Airflow 2.1 and below.\r\n\r\nThis caused Postgres 2.1.0 release backwards incompatibility and\r\nfailures for Airflow 2.1.0.\r\n\r\nSince the change is small and most of DBApi-derived hooks already\r\nset the schema field on their own, the best approach is to\r\nmake the schema field private for the DBApiHook and make a change\r\nin Postgres Hook to store the schema in the same way as all other\r\noperators.\r\n\r\nFixes: #17422\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

#7858\r\n\r\nAdding the ability to configure the `ShortCircuitOperator` to respect trigger rules for downstream tasks.  Currently this operator ignores all trigger rules and forcibly skips all downstream tasks.  However, there are use cases in which downstream tasks from the `ShortCircuitOperator` have trigger rules applied such that said tasks should execute even if upstream tasks are skipped by the operator (e.g. multiple branches that execute in parallel, one branch can be short-circuited at some point, and the branches converge).\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new parameter, `ignore_downstream_trigger_rules`, which allows users to have the `ShortCircuitOperator` perform a \"hard short\" (i.e. blindly skip all downstream tasks; the current behavior) or a \"soft short\" (i.e. the immediate, downstream task(s) are skipped only and the Scheduler is left to handle the trigger rules appropriately).\r\n\r\nThe unit tests for the `ShortCircuitOperator` were refactored as part of this change as well.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.rst#pull-request-guidelines)** for more

allow a custom `timetable` argument to work on a DAG, the existing `schedule_interval` attribute and the `normalized_schedule_interval` property are removed. All existing aceess to `schedule_interval` (the normalized\r\nproperty is not used anywhere) are all changed to use the DAG's `timetable` member. A couple of timetable-describing flags, `can_run` and `periodic`, are added to replace some usages that need to know about what the timetable\r\nis capable of doing.\r\n\r\nSerialization methods are added to timetable classes so the timetable can be saved to the meta database during DAG serialization.\r\n\r\nSince the `schedule_interval` attribute has been removed, the field on `DagModel` of the same name is also changed. Since we still need that information to display the timetable on the web UI, `timetable.summary` is used to “backfill” `schedule_interval` if a custom timetable is used. `schedule_interval` becomes purely cosmetic and only used to UI display.","created_at":"2021-08-04T13:01:59Z","updated_at":"2021-08-31T08:15:06Z","closed_at":"2021-08-31T08:15:04Z","merged_at":"2021-08-31T08:15:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"3fc57de44106afdd7d684ddf692f1f810a6ec7c3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"mik-laj","id":12058428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDU4NDI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12058428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj","html_url":"https://github.com/mik-laj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ryanahamilton","id":3267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanahamilton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"bbovenzi","id":4600967,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MDA5Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4600967?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi","html_url":"https://github.com/bbovenzi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1463392518,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDYzMz

PR adds timeout to answer the question, whether to rebuild\r\nimage when `breeze` is invoked or when pre-commit is run.\r\n\r\nThis reflects the typical use cases where rebuild is mostly not\r\nneeded, only in case of some tests which require new dependencies\r\nto be included.\r\n\r\nUser has still 4 seconds to answer Y and have the images rebuilt\r\nand just the presence of the question will be enough to get the\r\nuser trigger it from time to time.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

new LocalFilesystemToS3Operator under Amazon provider (#17168)\r\n\r\nCurrently, an S3Hook exists that allows transfer of files to S3 via `load_file()`, however there is no operator associated with it. The LocalFilesystemToS3Operator would wrap the S3 Hook, so it is not used directly.\r\n\r\nSeeing as to upload a local file to S3 using the S3 Hook, a Python task with the same functionality has to be written anyway, this could reduce a lot of redundant boiler-plate code and standardize the local file to S3 load process.\r\n\r\ncloses: #17168

came up during a conversaion with @ashb. Currently we are exposing the ability to directly create and edit a DagRun instance via F.A.B.’s CRUD view generation (the plus and edit icons on the DagRun list view). But these views don’t really make a lot of sense; creating a DagRun requires doing more than just adding a DagRun instance to the database (which is why triggering a DAG run in the home view uses `/trigger` instead). The `/dagrun/add` view provides essentially a way to manually modify Airflow’s internal state. So this view is removed.\r\n\r\nThe story with `/dagrun/edit` is similar. The only thing on a DagRun that can be reasonably edited is the state (running, failed, skipped, etc.), but that should also do more things than just setting the state, which is why we have *Mark Failed*, *Mark Success*, and *Clear* action buttons. Unfortunately, we can’t remove the field since we need the `can_edit` permission for those state-setting action methods, so instead all fields in the edit form is disabled so the user can’t modify anything on the DagRun.","created_at":"2021-08-02T10:21:12Z","updated_at":"2021-08-03T10:02:30Z","closed_at":"2021-08-03T10:02:27Z","merged_at":"2021-08-03T10:02:27Z","merge_commit_sha":"ac92b17964e698726f687986ded462144a50b831","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ryanahamilton","id":3267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanahamilton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545584474,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTg0NDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:webserver","name":"area:webserver","color":"a9db3f","default":false,"description":"Webserver

are using ghcr.io as image cache for our CI builds and Breeze\r\nand it seems ghcr.io is being \"rebuilt\" while running.\r\n\r\nWe had been using \"airflow-<branch>..\" image convention before,\r\nbacause multiple nesting levels of images were not supported,\r\nhowever we experienced errors recently with pushing 2.1 images\r\n(https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-22124) and during\r\ninvestigation it turned out, that it is possible now to use \"/\"\r\nin the name of the image, and while it still does not introduce\r\nmultiple nesting levels and folder structure, the UI of GitHub\r\ntreats it like that and if you have image which starts wiht\r\n\"airflow/\", the airflow prefix is stripped out and you can also\r\nhave even more \"/\" in then name to introduce further hierarchy.\r\n\r\nSince we have to change image naming convention due to (still\r\nunresolved) bug with no permission to push the v2-1-test image\r\nwe've decided to change naming convention for all our cache\r\nimages to follow this - now available - \"/\" connvention to make\r\nit better structured and easier to manage/understand.\r\n\r\nSome more optimisations are implemented - Python, prod-build and\r\nci-manifest images are only pushed when \"latest\" image is prepared.\r\nThey are not needed for the COMMIT builds because we only need\r\nfinal images for those builds. This simplified the code quite\r\na bit.\r\n\r\nCONTINUE_ON_PIP_CHECK_ERROR variable has been removed in favour\r\nof ignoring pip error when installing dependencies from branch\r\ntip. This might potentially happen for a short while when\r\nnew changes have been merged, but constraints were not yet\r\nregenerated and we have conflicting dependencies.\r\n\r\nThe .dockerignore was reviewed and builds were optimized for\r\npeople who locally built provider packages and documentation,\r\nby excluding unnecessary files. Some instructions which run after\r\nthe COPY . which did not need sourcer were moved before\r\nthe COPY command. Those optimisatiions save 30-40 seconds of\r\noverhead when building the image (especially when you build\r\nimages incrementally rather than rebuilding from scratch).\r\n\r\nPIP and HELM versions have been updated to latest available.\r\n\r\nBackwards-compatibility was implemented to allow PRs that have\r\nnot been upgraded to continue building after this one is merged,\r\nalso a workaround has been implemented to make this change\r\nto work even if it is not merged yet to main.\r\n\r\nThis \"legacy\" mode will be removed in ~week when everybody rebase\r\non top of main.\r\n\r\nDocumentation is updated reflecting those changes.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

you for contributing! Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests.

This can make it really difficult to identify and fix errors in callbacks.\r\n\r\nTo demonstrate, here'a a simple DAG with an error in the callback function:\r\n```python\r\nfrom airflow.models import DAG\r\nfrom airflow import utils\r\nfrom airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator\r\n\r\ndef message():\r\n    print('Hello, world.')\r\n\r\ndef broken_callback(context=None):\r\n    print(f\"Callback started\")\r\n    print(f\"Task {context['taskID']} finished successfully\")  # raises keyError\r\n    print(\"Callback complete.\")\r\n\r\nwith DAG(f'dag-with-broken-callback', schedule_interval=None, start_date=utils.dates.days_ago(1), ) as dag2:\r\n    \r\n    task = PythonOperator(\r\n        task_id='task',\r\n        python_callable=message,\r\n        on_success_callback=broken_callback,\r\n    )\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe task execution logs will cut off where the exception is thrown:\r\n```\r\n[2021-07-30, 16:25:44 UTC] {logging_mixin.py:109} INFO - Hello, world.\r\n[2021-07-30, 16:25:44 UTC] {python.py:151} INFO - Done.

for some reason (db load, system load ...) and not update the pid in database\r\n- Then the task is killed by heartbeat cause the pid is different from pid in database\r\n\r\nIt's critical in case of

`if key_name ...` part was doing nothing.\r\n\r\n`key_name` in previous code was always a one of two thing.\r\nNever empty, None, etc. (the typing annotation was wrong)\r\nSo` if key_name` always evaluated to `True`.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to move the key_name logic to be only under\r\nmissing bucket_name case, it would be slightly faster,\r\nbut then missing argument case would be maybe harder\r\nto debug.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

#17032 \r\nRelated to: #17239 \r\n*Recreated from #17252 \r\n\r\n`BigQueryInsertJobOperator` requires the specification of a configuration dict but, at present, this results in poor SQL rendering; especially if the queries are big or complex.\r\n\r\n### Current Example\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1670\" alt=\"127119136-3d6f1f57-c941-4b06-b3f3-c6094b31f821\"

provided to an operator to be rendered individually with the appropriate renderer.\r\n\r\nFor example, when the following configuration is submitted to `BigQueryInsertJobOperator` then, in addition to the JSON rendering of `configuration` the provided SQL should be separately rendered.\r\n\r\n```\r\nsql = '''\r\nINSERT INTO `target_project.target_dataset.target_table`\r\n(col1, col2, col3, col4)\r\nSELECT col1, col2, col3, col4\r\nFROM `source_project.source_dataset.source_table`\r\n'''\r\n\r\ntest = BigQueryInsertJobOperator(\r\n    task_id='test',\r\n    gcp_conn_id='my_gcp_connection',\r\n    configuration={\"query\": {\"query\": sql,\r\n                             \"destinationTable\": {\"projectId\": 'my_project',\r\n                                                  \"datasetId\": 'my_dataset',\r\n                                                  \"tableId\": 'my_table'},\r\n                             \"writeDisposition\": 'WRITE_TRUNCATE',\r\n                             \"useLegacySql\": False}\r\n                   }\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo achieve it, this PR enables any operator to receive a dot-separated path from `template_field_renderers` along with the renderer type.  In this case we want `BigQueryInsertJobOperator` to extract the value from `configuration` dict where the key path is `query.query`.  This is fully represented as follows:\r\n\r\n `template_fields_renderers = {\"configuration\": \"json\", \"configuration.query.query\": \"sql\"}`\r\n\r\nWhen building the rendered page, we check if the content is a dict - e.g. `configuration` - then, if so, return a generator object that yields every possible path of keys (`get_key_paths`) in the form `key1.key2.key3...keyX`. \r\n\r\nUsing this we can then check to see if any of these paths match with what we have in `template_field_renderers` and, if so, what the renderer is.  If it is a valid renderer then we can use that path to retrieve the value from the configuration (`get_value_from_path`).\r\n\r\n```\r\nif isinstance(content, dict):\r\n    for dict_keys in get_key_paths(content):\r\n        template_path = '.'.join((template_field, dict_keys))\r\n        renderer = task.template_fields_renderers.get(template_path, template_path)\r\n        if renderer in renderers:\r\n            content_value = get_value_from_path(dict_keys, content)\r\n            html_dict[template_path] = renderers[renderer](content_value)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe result of this is a rendered page which looks like the following:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1670\" alt=\"Screenshot 2021-07-26 at 14 51 48\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/967119/127123123-93beb8dd-eac3-44db-adb8-1e5a1115259a.png\">\r\n\r\nIn addition, when decorated tasks or Python operators are used, `op_kwargs` is parsed and each individual element is extracted and rendered.  Such that:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1668\" alt=\"127146694-eb6334b6-be41-4099-9f14-4b1a5093db7b\"

grammar edits, fixes to broken links, and rewording for clarification.\r\n\r\nThere are a few changes that others may disagree with me about:\r\n- Changed \"outwith\" to \"instead of\"\r\n- All non-code references I found to \"time-zone\" or \"timezone\" changed to \"time zone\"\r\n- It seems like top level pages are supposed to have capitalized words other than articles and prepositions, but two pages were not following this convention. I have changed them to conform to the others.\r\n- I found a sentence in the health checks section extremely confusing.

this change we truly lazy-load hooks and external_links only\r\nwhen we need them.

This is mainly for some CLI commands\r\n(for example `airlfow providers list` is much faster now), but\r\nalso in some scenarios where for example .get_conn() is never\r\nused in Tasks, tasks might also never need to import/load the hooks\r\nand they might perform faster, with smaller memory

session=session)` and `self._task_instances_for_dag_run(dag_run, session=session)` in backfill_job.py. In `_get_dag_run` method it use `runs = DagRun.find(dag_id=dag.dag_id, execution_date=run_date, session=session)` to find dagrun, but in `_instances_for_dag_run` it use `dagrun.refresh_from_db` to find dagrun, this method to find dagrun is different from `DagRun.find` so it will cause can not find dagrun when execution_date = 00:00 if set default_timezone=Asia/Shanghai, now I make them the same

#16013   \r\n\r\nThis is a workaround for the issue with `kubernetes-client` that results in an invalid API request by `V1LabelSelector` and `match_expressions`.
