What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nThis PR is going to support the identifier with a `catalog.database.table` format.\r\n\r\nFor Spark3 that support `catalog`, we can not just transform `UnsolvedRelation` to `TableIdentifier` directly.\r\nBecause in the cases that need to cooperate with the tables from the other catalog, it will block and throw an exception like

Repair the exception when reading optimized query for mor in hive and presto/trino, if the fileSlice with log file has not base file.\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nIn mor table , file slice may just has log file but has no base file, before the file slice is compacted. In this situation, if query mor in reading optimized query mod, it will match the condition `!baseFileOpt.isPresent()` in `HoodieCopyOnWriteTableInputFormat.createFileStatusUnchecked()` and throw IllegalStateException. It's not suitable. Instead of throw exception, it is more suiltable to query nothing in the file slice.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *Modify AnnotationLocation checkstyle rule in

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nWhen I read hudi table with spark readStream, FileNotFoundException happens after a while. This happens when a compaction happens and completes quickly while reading, deleting the file that was being read. Details I described at jira ticket.\r\n\r\nThe code I read hudi\r\n```\r\n    val df: DataFrame = spark.readStream.format(\"org.apache.hudi\")\r\n      .load(\"hdfs://10.19.29.148:8020/tmp/hudi/ss_bucket\")\r\n    df.writeStream\r\n      .format(\"console\")\r\n      .trigger(Trigger.ProcessingTime(\"5 seconds\"))\r\n      .option(\"checkpointLocation\", \"/tmp/hoodie/checkpoint_xicm\")\r\n      .start()\r\n      .awaitTermination()\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seems that there is no mechanism to ensure no compaction while doing incremental read. \r\n\r\nBecause of the checkpoint the job can't succeed even after a restart. \r\nThis pr filter files not exist to make stream read successful after a spark retry.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *Modify AnnotationLocation checkstyle rule in checkstyle.xml*\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis pull request is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis pull request is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n(or)\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end.*\r\n  - *Added HoodieClientWriteTest to verify the change.*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a job locally.*\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n       \r\n - [ ] For large changes, please consider breaking it

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nFrom 0.12, we are standardizing the default partition value for hudi as `__HIVE_DEFAULT_PARTITION__`. Previously, hudi was using \"default\" as the default value (i.e. if partition column is null, this fallback value will be used). The fix was put up so that query engines will not run into any class cast exception if original partition path fields are non string types. But after this fix, we might need to migrate older hudi tables. ie. if \"default\" partition exists, we have to rewrite it to `__HIVE_DEFAULT_PARTITION__`. This patch is adding an upgrade step, where we detect such hudi tables and fail the upgrade. And added instructions on what needs to be done before upgrading. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Added FourToFiveUpgradeHandler to detect hudi tables with \"default\" partition and throwing exception. \r\n- Added a new write config (\"hoodie.skip.default.partition.validation\") when enabled, will bypass the above validation. If users have a hudi table where \"default\" partition was created intentionally and not as sentinel, they can enable this config to get past the validation. \r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n- TestUpgradeDowngrade#testUpgradeFourtoFive\r\n- TestUpgradeDowngrade#testUpgradeFourtoFiveWithDefaultPartition\r\n- TestUpgradeDowngrade#testUpgradeFourtoFiveWithDefaultPartitionWithSkipValidation\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\n- We reverted the logic for getAllPartitionPaths in https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/5829. But based on feedback, made some minor tweaks to the reverted code (leverage spark par for dir processing) and perf numbers are still holding good and infact better in some cases. \r\n\r\nPerf numbers from S3 listing: \r\n\r\nListing a hudi table w/ 10k partitons with each partition having just 1 file. \r\n// Each value is avg from 10 runs. \r\n\r\n0.9.0: 11 to 12 secs. \r\n0.11.0: 120 to 140 secs.\r\nmaster: 11 to 12 secs. \r\nthis patch: 8 to 9 secs. \r\n\r\nListing a hudi table w/ 40 partitions w/ each having ~ 1000 files. \r\n\r\n0.9.0: 900 to 1000 msec.\r\n0.11.0: 700 to 850

Change Logs\r\n\r\n#### Spark 3.x Orc incompatibility\r\n\r\nAddressing Orc support being broken for Spark 3.x. \r\n\r\nOriginally Orc support was added based on `orc-core:nohive` dependency. However it's incompatible w/ `orc-core` dependency since it shades the dependencies otherwise used from `hive-storage-api`:\r\n - `orc-core` relies on Hive classes like `org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.exec.vector.VectorizedRowBatch`, while\r\n - `orc-core:nohive` relies on the same classes copied over to Orc itself (in this case `org.apache.orc.storage.ql.exec.vector.VectorizedRowBatch`)\r\n\r\nNow when we use Spark bringing in its own `orc-core` dependency, it breaks `HoodieOrcWriter` as it can't find classes expected ( `org.apache.orc.storage.*` ones).\r\n\r\nIn this PR we're addressing this by replacing `orc-core:nohive` w/ `orc-core`, and making sure they versions are synchronized w/ Spark (minor) versions we're going to be bundling against.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nAffect core write/read path with Orc\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nMedium\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\nIn Hudi 0.11.0 a lot of refactoring has been done to the `InputFormat` code for better organization and optimizations. As part of that `HoodieRealtimePath` class was introduced, which extends the standard hadoop Path and a method to determine whether the path `isSplitable` was introduced in the class. This logic does not take into account whether the real time path is for bootstrap split or not. It simply determines whether splitting is possible based on whether there is a base path (base parquet file).\r\n\r\nWhen bootstrap feature was developed, it was a design decision to disable file splitting for bootstrap scenario because there is no way we can make sure that source file (external file) gets split at exactly the same rows as the hudi file. There is no way to create splits with 1 to 1 mapping which can then be stitched together at runtime.\r\n\r\nThis disabling is handled correctly for COW scenario https://github.com/apache/hudi/blob/master/hudi-hadoop-mr/src/main/java/org/apache/hudi/hadoop/HoodieCopyOnWriteTableInputFormat.java#L81 but it never reaches here for real time queries because https://github.com/apache/hudi/blob/master/hudi-hadoop-mr/src/main/java/org/apache/hudi/hadoop/realtime/HoodieMergeOnReadTableInputFormat.java#L191 ends up being true and hence the call to super method is never reached.\r\n\r\nIn this change we are disabling file splitting correctly for bootstrap real time queries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *Modify

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the performance problem of repeated data file reading and log merging in the metadata table.\r\n\r\nIn `HoodieBackedTableMetadata` which provides the metadata based on the metadata table, there is a flag `reuse` to control whether to reuse base file and log readers across multiple API calls.  If enabled, the readers are reused and the merged log records are cached inside the log reader so they can be returned immediately.  If disabled, the data file reading and log merging happen again from the cold load.  The Presto Hive connector uses `FileSystemViewManager.createInMemoryFileSystemView` to create file system view, and when metadata table is enabled, the `reuse` flag is set to false, causing repeated reading and poor performance during the query planning phase.\r\n\r\nThis PR flips the `reuse` flag in the above method to make the partition listing more efficient.\r\n\r\nNote that the fix also improves Hudi connector which uses `FileSystemViewManager.createInMemoryFileSystemViewWithTimeline` calling the same underlying API with the `reuse` flag set to false before this fix.\r\n\r\nCall stack from Presto Hive connector:\r\n\r\n```\r\nHudiDirectoryLister constructor (Presto)\r\n  this.fileSystemView = FileSystemViewManager.createInMemoryFileSystemView(engineContext, metaClient, metadataConfig);\r\n-> FileSystemViewManager.createInMemoryFileSystemViewWithTimeline (Hudi)\r\n  new HoodieMetadataFileSystemView(engineContext, metaClient, timeline, metadataConfig)\r\n-> HoodieMetadataFileSystemView (Hudi)\r\n  this.tableMetadata = HoodieTableMetadata.create(engineContext, metadataConfig, metaClient.getBasePath(), (String)FileSystemViewStorageConfig.SPILLABLE_DIR.defaultValue());\r\n\r\nHudiFileInfoIterator constructor (Presto)\r\n  when metadata table is enabled: `this.hoodieBaseFileIterator = fileSystemView.getLatestBaseFiles(partition).iterator();`\r\n-> AbstractTableFileSystemView (Hudi)\r\n  getLatestBaseFiles() -> ensurePartitionLoadedCorrectly()\r\n-> HoodieMetadataFileSystemView (Hudi)\r\n  this.tableMetadata.getAllFilesInPartition(partitionPath);\r\n-> BaseTableMetadata (Hudi)\r\n  getAllFilesInPartition -> fetchAllFilesInPartition -> getRecordByKey(partitionName, MetadataPartitionType.FILES.getPartitionPath())\r\n```\r\n\r\nCall stack from Presto Hudi connector:\r\n```\r\nHudiSplitManager (Presto)\r\n  getSplits()\r\n-> FileSystemViewManager.createInMemoryFileSystemViewWithTimeline (Hudi)\r\n  new HoodieMetadataFileSystemView(engineContext, metaClient, timeline, metadataConfig)\r\n  \r\n  fsView.getLatestFileSlicesBeforeOrOn(relativePartitionPath, timestamp, false)\r\n-> AbstractTableFileSystemView (Hudi)\r\n  ensurePartitionLoadedCorrectly()\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is the analysis of the scope of impact of the `reuse` flag flipping from `false` to `true` in `HoodieBackedTableMetadata` to avoid repeated data file reading and log merging in the metadata table:\r\n\r\nConstructor `HoodieBackedTableMetadata(HoodieEngineContext engineContext, HoodieMetadataConfig metadataConfig, String datasetBasePath, String spillableMapDirectory)`.  This constructor still sets the `reuse` flag to `false`, which is kept as is (no impact. We can follow up to see if this should also be flipped).\r\n- `MetadataCommand` in `hudi-cli`: these are for Hudi metadata-related CLIs which do not affect production\r\n- `HoodieBackedTableMetadataWriter` in `hudi-client-common`: used by `initTableMetadata()` to initialize metadata table.  Each time this is called, a new `HoodieBackedTableMetadata` instance is going to be created.\r\n- `HoodieMergeOnReadRDD` in `hudi-spark-common`: used by `scanLog()` to directly read the metadata table with Spark datasource (`spark.read.format(\"hudi\").load(\"<metadata_table_path>\")`).  A new `HoodieBackedTableMetadata` instance is created each time this method is called.\r\n- `*MetadataTable*Procedure` classes in `hudi-spark`: used for procedure SQLs to read the metadata table information, which does not affect table content.\r\n\r\nConstructor `HoodieBackedTableMetadata(HoodieEngineContext engineContext, HoodieMetadataConfig metadataConfig, String datasetBasePath, String spillableMapDirectory, boolean reuse)`, which assigns the `reuse` flag (no impact)\r\n- `HoodieTableMetadata.create`: creating a new `HoodieBackedTableMetadata` instance with the `reuse` flag.\r\n- `TestHoodieBackedTableMetadata`: for testing `HoodieBackedTableMetadata`\r\n\r\nStatic method `HoodieTableMetadata.create(HoodieEngineContext engineContext, HoodieMetadataConfig metadataConfig, String datasetBasePath, String spillableMapPath, boolean reuse)`\r\n- `FSUtils.getFilesInPartitions(HoodieEngineContext engineContext, HoodieMetadataConfig metadataConfig, String basePathStr, String[] partitionPaths, String spillableMapPath)`: `reuse` flag is already set to `true` (no impact)\r\n- `FileSystemViewManager.createViewManager(final HoodieEngineContext context, final HoodieMetadataConfig metadataConfig, final FileSystemViewStorageConfig config, final HoodieCommonConfig commonConfig, final String basePath)`: `reuse` flag is already set to `true` (no impact)\r\n- `HoodieMetadataFileSystemView(HoodieEngineContext engineContext, HoodieTableMetaClient metaClient, HoodieTimeline visibleActiveTimeline, HoodieMetadataConfig metadataConfig)`: flips the `reuse` flag to `true` in this PR (behavior change)\r\n- `HoodieTableMetadata.create(HoodieEngineContext engineContext, HoodieMetadataConfig metadataConfig, String datasetBasePath, String spillableMapPath)`: still sets the `reuse` flag to `false` (no impact)\r\n\r\nConstructor `HoodieMetadataFileSystemView(HoodieEngineContext engineContext, HoodieTableMetaClient metaClient, HoodieTimeline visibleActiveTimeline, HoodieMetadataConfig metadataConfig)`:\r\n- `FileSystemViewManager.createInMemoryFileSystemViewWithTimeline`: called by `FileSystemViewManager.createInMemoryFileSystemView`, which is used in Presto Hive connector for Hudi integration.\r\n- `ManifestFileWriter.fetchLatestBaseFilesForAllPartitions` in `hudi-sync-common`: used for listing partitions in meta sync \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Sets `reuse` flag to `true` in `HoodieMetadataFileSystemView` to avoid repeated data file reading and log merging\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request is already covered by existing tests in `TestHoodieBackedTableMetadata`.  Performance tests are done in a Presto cluster with 1 coordinator (15 cores) and 10 workers (150 cores in total).  For TPC-DS query 42 which reads partitioned tables with 1000 of partitions, before this fix, the query takes 370s with metadata table enabled in Hive connector.  After this fix, the query takes 45s (8x speedup), and based on the logging, the partition listing is much more efficient.  A similar improvement is observed for Presto Hudi connector.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nIn our internal benchmarks we've detected that there's a very clear performance gap b/w following sequences even though they are using essentially the same underlying infra:\r\n\r\n1. Spark SQL: `INSERT INTO` statement\r\n2. Writing via Spark DS\r\n\r\nThe issue turned out to be inadvertent dereferencing of the incoming `Dataset` into `RDD[Row]`, entailing the penalty of deserialization of every row. \r\n\r\nAfter resolving both of this code-paths have comparable runtime.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n - Cleaning up shaping up flow to avoid unnecessary conversions\r\n - Cleaning up schema reconciliation and evolution handling to fix improper nullability handling\r\n - Avoiding the conversion loop `Dataset` > `RDD[Row]` > `Dataset`\r\n - Tidying up\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message

Issue Summary\r\n\r\n* The payload classes from `hudi-common` get shaded inside `hudi-hadoop-mr-bundle` and are used at hive runtime .

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nThe repo recently upgraded to start using log4j2 instead of log4j. There are a few configuration and dependency changes that needed to happen to make sure all logging was working properly.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - Used the maven enforcer plugin to ensure that the log4j dependencies are no longer being included in any of our modules or transitive dependencies since this can cause issues at runtime\r\n  - Added dependency exclusions to satisfy the enforcer rules\r\n  - Replaced log4j properties files with their log4j2 equivalents\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - Validate that logging works as expected - I validated that the log levels are properly set when looking at our test outputs.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n       \r\n - [ ] For large changes, please consider breaking it into sub-tasks under an umbrella JIRA.\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-21T19:29:48Z","updated_at":"2022-08-25T01:48:27Z","closed_at":"2022-08-25T01:48:26Z","merged_at":"2022-08-25T01:48:26Z","merge_commit_sha":"5f92221655416a345749eae38836d94be873d8e1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2719800718,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE5ODAwNzE4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/priority:critical","name":"priority:critical","color":"B60205","default":false,"description":"production

\r\n\r\n\r\n## *Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nAmazon CloudWatch reporter is broken for metadata enabled tables.\r\n\r\nThis appears to be broken since this commit: https://github.com/apache/hudi/commit/9797fdfbb27ca8f5f06875ad958b597becc27a8d. The commit makes metrics prefix configurable, changing it from the earlier way of using the table name directly. For metadata table, while publishing the metrics, this turns up as empty because the inference mechanism does not find table name in the HoodieConfig it is trying to lookup.\r\n\r\nThis breaks while publishing metrics to cloudwatch, since it cannot publish a Dimension with empty value.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request is a trivial rework /

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## Issue summary \r\nJIRA https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-4435\r\n\r\nFor Avro to 1.10.2, bootstrap realtime table queries through inputformat would break w/ the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\norg.apache.avro.AvroRuntimeException: Not a valid schema field: _hoodie_commit_seqno\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is because when converting Avro records to ArrayWritable, Hudi calls `avroToArrayWritable(Object value, Schema schema)` which would try to extract all the fields in the schema from Avro record. However, in some queries, not all the fields are required in the record, e.g. when enabling usesCustomPayload (which is enabled for bootstrap tables by default), only projection columns are loaded: https://github.com/apache/hudi/blob/release-0.10.1/hudi-hadoop-mr/src/main/java/org/apache/hudi/hadoop/realtime/RealtimeCompactedRecordReader.java#L145-L148. This means some fields are not provided in the record.\r\n\r\nBefore Avro 1.10, this is fine because if record.get(field.name() failed, it would just return null. However, after Avro 1.10, it would throw a realtime exception `AvroRuntimeException` and break the job. So in this patch, we would catch this runtime exception. We also want to make this flexible for both avro 1.8.2 and avro 1.10.2 which contains different api methods, for example `hasField` seems to be present in avro 1.10.2 but not older avro. \r\n\r\n##

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\nJIRA https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-4434\r\n\r\nContribute internal EMR patches to target goal of out of box experience for 0.12 on EMR 6.9.0 (for hudi-spark), for now disabling these two properties. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Issue Summary for dataPrefetch disabled\r\n\r\nRead optimized queries on Hudi 0.11 are failing with EMR spark with partition schema mismatch error, the root caused comes from the data prefetcher feature implemented by EMR Spark team. To target goal of out of box experience for hudi 0.12 on emr 6.9.0, the safest bet is to disable the data prefetcher functionality for Hudi.\r\n\r\nThis issue has been introduced since 0.11, because with this release Hudi has introduced its own `FileFormat` implementation wrapped within `HadoopFsRelation` for performing read optimized queries. In that logic has been introduced to handle scenarios where partition values are read directly from data file instead of being derived from path as was the case earlier. However, this is not correctly handled in EMR Spark's case because Hudi's File Format implementation has not overridden the data prefetcher api and it still goes to the default implementation.\r\n\r\n We will look at a fix to make this work, but it will require a much larger change within Hudi or Spark. We will either have to modify Hudi's file format implementation to override data prefetcher API as well and have custom logic for partition schema handling, or we have to update EMR Spark's implementation to handle this better. So for now, its best to disable this feature for Hudi.\r\n\r\n## Testing for dataPrefetch disabled\r\nPerformed manual testing on latest emr spark to confirm that after disabling, read optimized queries work fine.\r\n```\r\nspark-sql> select * from hudi_basic_test_cow41992;\r\n...\r\n20220513222434502    20220513222434502_0_2    1    one    689d1788-9496-42c0-997c-29a23dbf4678-0_0-7-8_20220513222434502.parquet    1    2015-01-01T23:37:44.343090Z    event_a    8087121    one\r\n20220513222434502    20220513222434502_0_3    3    one    689d1788-9496-42c0-997c-29a23dbf4678-0_0-7-8_20220513222434502.parquet    3    2015-01-01T18:47:44.343090Z    event_c    423424    one\r\n20220513222434502    20220513222434502_0_4    4    one    689d1788-9496-42c0-997c-29a23dbf4678-0_0-7-8_20220513222434502.parquet    4    2015-01-01T19:57:44.343090Z    event_d    52352    one\r\n20220513222434502    20220513222434502_0_5    5    one    689d1788-9496-42c0-997c-29a23dbf4678-0_0-7-8_20220513222434502.parquet    5    2015-01-01T20:31:44.343090Z    event_e    1111    one\r\n20220513222434502    20220513222434502_1_1    2    two    8a1ebcb8-53ca-462d-b9b0-67c00c5579bc-0_1-7-9_20220513222434502.parquet    2    2015-01-02T22:20:44.343090Z    event_b    312131    two\r\nTime taken: 1.341 seconds, Fetched 5 row(s)\r\nspark-sql> show tables;\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Issue Summary for S3 metadata cache disable\r\n\r\nsimilar JIRA https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/5553 \r\n\r\nEmrFS has a cache that is enabled by default, where is maintains File Metadata (FileStaus info) for 60 seconds:\r\n\r\nIt appears that there is a bug with this caching mechanism, and it has surfaced up with Hudi 0.11.0 release more prominently, specially with the checksum information being saved to hoodie.properties which increases the likely hood of file length being changed upon update.\r\n\r\nEMR Hudi's DML test in is failing in the select query that is run immediately after the alter table rename. The root cause is that with alter table rename, the drive modifies the hoodie.properties file with the new table name and checksum. \r\n\r\nHowever, select query is run immediately after, and the existing executor has hoodie.properties file metadata still cached in its EmrFS instance (there is one instance per executor) from a previous query run. Thus, it uses the previous length of the file in the InputStream, even though the file length has changed.\r\n\r\nThis needs a fix in EmrFS, and we will work with internal AWS team.\r\n\r\n## Testing for emrfs caching disabled\r\nThe DML integration tests are passing after this change:\r\n\r\nAlso, ran the test several times manually on the cluster to confirm there is no flakiness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [x] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [x] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nFor now, NUM_COMMITS or TIME_ELAPSED compaction trigger strategy will check the number or time of delta-commits after the last successful compaction. so if the offline compaction application crash for a while, there will be a lot of compaction request（one request per delta commit） in the timeline, and that will have a side effect on performance.\r\n\r\nprovide a new strategy not to check the last successful compaction but check the last compaction request if possible.\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *Modify
