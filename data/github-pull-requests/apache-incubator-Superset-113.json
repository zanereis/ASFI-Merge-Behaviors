SUMMARY\r\nFixes/Improvement to the existing implementation:\r\n- marshmallow schema for `validator_config_json` `op` was called `operation`: **This needs a FE change**\r\n- Introduces a new state called `GRACE` when alerts enter a grace period after a `SUCCESS`: **This needs a FE change**\r\n- Add a column to `ReportSchedule` named `working_timeout` so that bogus reports do not enter a dead end state: **This need a FE change** (this new column can/should be set by the user when configuring a new Report/Alert)\r\n- Fetches the `THUMBNAIL_SELENIUM_USER` using current worker scoped ORM session (not security manager session)\r\n- `AsyncExecuteReportScheduleCommand` calls a state machine, more readable code and easier to reason and extend\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Requires DB Migration.\r\n- [X] Confirm DB Migration upgrade and downgrade tested.\r\n- [ ] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or API\r\n\r\n@mihir174","created_at":"2020-12-02T12:22:03Z","updated_at":"2024-03-12T22:23:34Z","closed_at":"2020-12-09T18:19:07Z","merged_at":"2020-12-09T18:19:07Z","merge_commit_sha":"1e3aaab59075c5220e444759e07a26c080586fed","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"nytai","id":10255196,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjU1MTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10255196?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai","html_url":"https://github.com/nytai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"bkyryliuk","id":5727938,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Mjc5Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5727938?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk","html_url":"https://github.com/bkyryliuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkyryliuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1127990345,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTI3OTkwMzQ1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/risk:db-migration","name":"risk:db-migration","color":"e67e22","default":false,"description":"PRs

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new button to import databases from the UI if the `VERSIONED_EXPORT` feature flag is enabled. It allows users to import databases in the new format proposed in https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/issues/11167.\r\n\r\nThe biggest challenge in importing databases is that we export them without passwords, extra security information, nor certificates. When importing database we can inspect the `sqlalchemy_uri` attribute and see if it has a masked password (`XXXXXXXX`), and if true we can prompt the user for the password.\r\n\r\nThe second biggest challenge is that we don't know how many databases are present in the imported file, since users can export multiple databases at once in a single file. We also don't know how many of those require passwords, since not all databases use them.\r\n\r\nTo work around this when the user tries to import a file the frontend will upload it to the backend. The backend performs validation on the file, and if there are databases with masked passwords it returns a validation error (422). The frontend will parse the error message, and if the only errors are from missing passwords it will prompt the user for the passwords and resubmit the file, this time with the associated passwords.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the backend validation, as well as the import modal. For the API calls I created a new hook similar to `useSingleViewResource` called `useImportResource`, which will be reused for other imports (dataset, chart, dashboard and saved queries).\r\n\r\n###

the changes -->\r\n\r\nManually tested importing a database, and confirmed it prompts for the password and the database is configured correctly.\r\n\r\nAlso added tests.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR checks if annotation type, that user wants to use, is supported by this kind of chart. \r\nFor example, time-line bar chart does not support FORMULA annotation. As specified in `superset-ui`, time-line bar chart should support only interval or event annotations. The problem was that the default annotation type was set to FORMULA for all of the charts. \r\nIn my PR, we first check, which annotation types are supported - if Formula is one of them, we set it as a default one, showing when we open the Annotation Modal. If not, we take the first annotation from Supported Annotations array.\r\nIt also impacts issue #11790.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

TEST PLAN\r\nVerify manually.\r\nCreate time-series bar chart and try to add annotation layer.\r\nTry also with some chart, which Formula is a supported annotation type, for example line chart.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [x] Has associated issue:

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR implements feature described in https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-roadmap/issues/61.\r\nThe goal was to move `View results` and `View samples` tables from `DisplayQueryButton` to main Explore view. Tables are placed in tabs, in a collapsible section.\r\nThe whole chart/table area is resizable, with tables section initially collapsed and with minimal height to show as much of the chart as possible. After \"uncollapsing\" it automatically resizes to 40% if container height, leaving 60% for the chart. The heights can be further adjusted with split handle. After collapsing, it shrinks back to its original height.\r\nThe implemented UI is a bit different compared to the one linked in the issue - changes were discussed with @junlincc and @rusackas.\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n![ezgif com-gif-maker (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/100915702-00bd0c80-34d5-11eb-8bf4-0910ad799c5d.gif)\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n1.

SUMMARY\r\nIn https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/issues/11813 I noticed that the avatar text sizes weren't very consistent due to the varying size of 2 characters in English (\"II\" is much thinner than \"WW\"). After playing around more with the Avatar component, I realized this was because we were setting a much larger size than necessary for the Avatar text (21px). I reduced this to 14px, what seemed to be a happy medium between the 21px that \"II\" could fit in and the tiny 9px that \"WW\" needed to fully fit. It doesn't entirely fix the problem, but I think it's the best we'll get, unless we decided to make these monospaced (something that I considered a worse option).\r\n\r\nI also refactored the style application code a bit to adhere to DRY\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore:\r\n![Screen Shot 2020-11-29 at 7 24 23 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7409244/100566006-bc820000-3279-11eb-8de0-d136f78881a2.png)\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n![Screen Shot 2020-11-29 at 7 23 22 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7409244/100566010-c0158700-3279-11eb-99e5-6800f234a493.png)\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nTest in storybook with initials `II` and `WW`.

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nNative filters is currently **not** feature-complete, but I am opening this PR anyway. We want to validate community acceptance of the core approaches before building the rest on top. This is behind a feature flag, so no need to worry about pushing out unpolished features.\r\n\r\nFuture enhancements will come as separate PRs. Because of this, some filter controls don't do anything yet.\r\n\r\nChanges included in this PR:\r\n\r\n- dashboard metadata filter schema\r\n- dashboard-native filters can be created, edited, and deleted\r\n- charts respond to filters when the user sets values\r\n- filters can be scoped to specific dashboard panels\r\n- ~upgrading react-redux to use ✨hooks✨~\r\n\r\nChanges to be implemented in follow-up PRs:\r\n\r\n- adjust styling to match design spec\r\n- better filter delete UX\r\n- filter indicator compatibility\r\n- date filters\r\n- cascading filters\r\n- error boundaries\r\n- non-instant filtering\r\n- default values\r\n- ... ?\r\n\r\nThis depends on a corresponding change in superset-ui\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not

verify the changes -->\r\n\r\n- (until the superset-ui PR is merged) check out the `villebro/filter-component` branch on superset-ui\r\n- ensure that everything still works as expected with the feature flag off\r\n- Turn on the `DASHBOARD_NATIVE_FILTERS` feature flag\r\n- go to a dashboard\r\n- use the filter bar to add some filters\r\n- apply filter values\r\n- edit filters, delete filters\r\n\r\nAlso, unit and e2e tests\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nIn the new import files, we have a ZIP file called `exported_$object_$timestamp.zip`, with the files inside all prefixed with the ZIP name without the extension:\r\n\r\n- `exported_$object_$timestamp/metadata.yaml`\r\n- `exported_$object_$timestamp/databases/example.yaml`\r\n- etc.\r\n\r\nThe import commands (eg, `ImportDatabasesCommand`) expect the file names to be **without** the prefix, ie:\r\n\r\n- `metadata.yaml`\r\n- `databases/example.yaml`\r\n- etc.\r\n\r\nI modified the API to remove the prefix.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes

SUMMARY\r\nSuperset allow users to enable [CORS](https://pypi.org/project/Flask-Cors/) and domain sharding to improve dashboard performance. Currently domain sharding is enabled by offer a list of domains in `SUPERSET_WEBSERVER_DOMAINS`. But in current configuration, once domain sharding is enabled, it applies to every user in the system. \r\n\r\nWe found there are some cases that we need to exempt some service users from domain sharding. This PR is to add an additional feature flag, so that we can apply/disable this feature to certain users while keeping Superset have domain sharding available.\r\n\r\n### TEST

SUMMARY\r\nMore recent versions of Pandas and PyArrow have started raising exceptions when trying to mutate DataFrames created by PyArrow in-place (see e.g. https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-9772). As it is generally bad practice to mutate objects like this, it is preferable to first make a copy of the `DataFrame` prior to mutating the column values in the `dist_bar` chart. This fixes the following exception seen on current master:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/superset/views/base.py\", line 177, in

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThe current import functionality (v0) was recently moved to two different commands:\r\n\r\n- `datasets.commands.importers.v0.ImportDatasetsCommand`\r\n- `dashboards.commands.importers.v0.ImportDashboardsCommand`\r\n\r\nThe code was moved without modifications, but I plan on cleaning it in the near future, adding proper validation and standardizing on the `ImportExportMixin` that we use for v1. But before we can do that we need to add unit tests! :)\r\n\r\nThis PR adds unit tests to the v0 import, based on the files that are exported from the UI and the CLI. For dashboards the v0 export from the UI and from the CLI (`superset export-dashboards`) is identical, but for datasets they produce different files. I've changed the `ImportDatasetsCommand` to support both, and added tests for both.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n###

SUMMARY\r\nThe current table selector only gets table names from the database engine itself, and leaves out any additional metadata a user may have provided to a physical dataset. This merges the tables list returned from the database with any extra metadata from the datasets so we can display certification status in table selectors throughout the product\r\n\r\n### AFTER

SUMMARY\r\nDue to how menu component was mounted (at the end of body), the selector defined in `downloadAsImage` function returned null instead of dashboard component. This PR changes the mount node of Menu to `div.dashboard`.\r\n\r\nAnother issue was that menu did not close on time before a screenshot was made. I fixed it by using wrapping `downloadAsImage` in `setTimeout` with 1s delay - any suggestion on how to do it better would be greatly appreciated. Using `visible` prop on menu trigger and running `downloadAsImage` in a callback of setState did not work; same as using setTimeout with 0 delay.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nImages below are results of running `downloadAsImage` on a chart.\r\n\r\nBefore - menu is visible and it covers the chart:\r\n![test-2020-11-23T13-52-56

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nImplement [[SIP-56] Adopt React Testing Library for testing React components](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/issues/11688).\r\n\r\n- Add React Testing Library\r\n- Updated the setup files\r\n- Convert a couple of existing components with the new library\r\n\r\nAs demonstrated in the new code, with RTL, we are able to easily test the use of the `useEffect` hook with DOM updates, that is previously not possible to do in Enzyme. Just make sure to use [waitFor](https://testing-library.com/docs/dom-testing-library/api-async/) to wait for the DOM change, otherwise you may encounter `an update inside a test was not wrapped in act(...)` errors.\r\n\r\nAnother lesson learned  is that in order to use `waitFor`, you must explicitly add a `jest-environment: jsdom` docblock to the test file, because the default jest environment `jest-enzyme` is incompatible with RTL.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n/**\r\n * @jest-environment jsdom\r\n */\r\n```\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TEST

SUMMARY\r\nFirst PR for security permission simplification. Scope `SavedQuery` for API and MVC FAB classes.\r\n\r\nThe DB migration step is ready to upgrade and downgrade, note that downgrade will work just fine with superset default roles, but on custom made roles some granularity may be lost, since after converging (upgrading) there is information loss\r\n\r\n#### Existing permissions:\r\n| Permission    | View

SUMMARY\r\nBecause sqllab tab name supports i18n. The sqllab `.CSV` button will use that name for the attachment file name. But the sqllab query tab name can be something unsafe in HTTP header. Without URL encoding this will cause an error like this:\r\n```\r\nError on request:\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/Users/auxten/.pyenv/versions/3.7.6/envs/superset-0.35.2/lib/python3.7/site-packages/werkzeug/serving.py\", line 323, in run_wsgi\r\n    execute(self.server.app)\r\n  File \"/Users/auxten/.pyenv/versions/3.7.6/envs/superset-0.35.2/lib/python3.7/site-packages/werkzeug/serving.py\", line 315, in execute\r\n    write(data)\r\n  File \"/Users/auxten/.pyenv/versions/3.7.6/envs/superset-0.35.2/lib/python3.7/site-packages/werkzeug/serving.py\", line 276, in write\r\n    self.send_header(key, value)\r\n  File \"/Users/auxten/.pyenv/versions/3.7.6/lib/python3.7/http/server.py\", line 516, in send_header\r\n    (\"%s: %s\\r\\n\" % (keyword, value)).encode('latin-1', 'strict'))\r\nUnicodeEncodeError: 'latin-1' codec can't encode characters in position 49-54: ordinal not in range(256)\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom the discussion here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/93551/how-to-encode-the-filename-parameter-of-content-disposition-header-in-http#comment65669446_6745788\r\nAnd blog here: https://fastmail.blog/2011/06/24/download-non-english-filenames/\r\n\r\nHere comes the patch.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/240147/99773186-0155ba80-2b47-11eb-9cf3-2c98a6e67e2e.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n1.

SUMMARY\r\nUpdates Cypress e2e test Github Actions workflow to use the [pull_request_target event](https://github.blog/2020-08-03-github-actions-improvements-for-fork-and-pull-request-workflows/) in order to work around the [secrets sharing limitation](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#using-encrypted-secrets-in-a-workflow) for forked repos. Also adds concurrency via multiple `containers`.\r\n\r\n**NOTE**: the `pull_request` event trigger is required to get e2e tests passing in this PR, but will be removed in a subsequent PR in favor of `pull_request_target`.\r\n\r\nReplaces https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/11730\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n###

SUMMARY\r\nReplaces usages of Tooltip and OverlayTrigger from `react-bootstrap` witht Tooltip from `Antd`.\r\nThe following components are affected by this PR:\r\nColumnElement, Button, SqlEditor, Link, AdhocMetrticPopoverTitle, ControlHeader, DateFilterControl, VizTypeControl, QueryAndSaveBtns, CopyToClipboard, TooltipWrapper, Field.\r\nComponents that use `InfoTooltipWithTrigger` (e.g. controls on Explore view) are not affected by this PR as `InfoTooltipWithTrigger` is defined in `superset-ui` library.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nThe changes affect almost every view. Here's an example from SqlLab's `ColumnElement`. Visually they're very similar, what's different is that you can hover and select text in the new Antd tooltip; before the tooltip disappeared when you stopped hovering the trigger.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/99572434-f4b15500-29d4-11eb-9f42-33652c3a11a8.png)\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/99572200-9be1bc80-29d4-11eb-86ad-b910367a6df5.png)\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nManually test the affected components.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an

SUMMARY\r\nPer @ktmud's findings from https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/11289 there is some jumpy behavior if the \r\nplaceholder is very wide. It looks like react-select is setting a dynamic width on the input based on the length of the placeholder. Then there's an overflow: hidden to cut down the size to fit the component. Together with the existing flex-box styling, it forced the element to go off the element to the left. The width element is somewhat fighting with the flex-box functionality, so I overwrote it and relied solely on flexbox to determine the width of the elements and let it adjust more gracefully. I'm not 100% familiar with the react-select library, so there may be more tooling hid somewhere that we can utilize. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n![select_dropdown

SUMMARY\r\nPR #10645 introduced a regression that caused calculated columns to be dropped when syncing datasource metadata in the legacy CRUD list. When saving the dataset in the legacy CRUD view, metadata was also automatically synced, causing loss of calculated columns. Previously the metadata refresh was triggered every time the dataset was saved in the legacy CRUD view, but the effect of this was less noticeable as the previous metadata refresh only added new columns, updated existing types and left non-present physical columns in the dataset metadata.\r\n\r\nThis changes behavior in the following way:\r\n- Metadata is no longer automatically synced when saved in the legacy CRUD view.\r\n- Calculated columns are no longer dropped when synced in the legacy CRUD list.\r\n- Calculated columns are replaced with its physical counterpart if a physical column with the same name has been added to the dataset.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nLocal testing + CI + new tests\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Requires DB Migration.\r\n- [ ] Confirm DB Migration
