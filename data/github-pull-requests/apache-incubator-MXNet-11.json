Description ##\r\nThis PR separates the partitioning backend from hybridize.\r\n`hybridize` now clears any previous optimization, sets the CachedOp args and activate the hybridization.\r\n`optimize_for` is responsible of setting the backend, backend options and running the partitioning with backend.\r\n\r\nIf the user wish to use any partitioning backend, they have use optimize_for.\r\n\r\nIt also changes the default value of `optimize_for`'s `clear` arg, making the chaining of the backend the default behavior.\r\n\r\nThe PR also make the CachedOp kwargs explicit and documented :  `static_alloc, static_shape, inline_limit, forward_bulk_size, backward_bulk_size`.\r\n\r\n## Examples ##\r\n\r\n### How optimize_for changed\r\n#### Before\r\n```\r\nblk.optimize_for(x, backend=\"someBackend\", backend_opts={'dedup_subgraph':True})\r\n```\r\n#### After\r\n```\r\nblk.optimize_for(x, backend=\"someBackend\", dedup_subgraph=True)\r\n```\r\n### How hybridize changed\r\n#### Before\r\n```\r\nblk.hybridize(backend=\"someBackend\", static_alloc=True)\r\nblk(x)\r\n```\r\n#### After \r\nHybridize can't be used to set the backend anymore, we now have to use `optimize_for`, which will call hybridize internally.\r\n```\r\nblk.optimize_for(x, backend=\"someBackend\", static_alloc=True)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How chaining backends changed\r\n#### Before\r\n```\r\nblk.optimize_for(x, backend=\"firstBackend\", static_alloc=True)\r\nblk.optimize_for(x, backend=\"secondBackend\", clear=False, dedup_subgraph=True)\r\n```\r\n#### After\r\n`clear` default value is `False`, we simply chain them\r\n```\r\nblk.optimize_for(x, backend=\"firstBackend\", static_alloc=True)\r\nblk.optimize_for(x, backend=\"secondBackend\", dedup_subgraph=True)\r\n```\r\n\r\ncc @samskalicky who helped to design the API offline and reviewed the  `1.x` related PR #19386 \r\n     @mseth10 who helped by reviewing

Description ##\r\nFixes to build properly on Windows with Cuda 11.0:\r\n\r\n* Update multi_lamb.cu and multi_lans.cu to use cuda's pow() function instead of std::pow() and statically cast exponent to float so it matches cuda pow signature.\r\n\r\nFixes compilation errors:\r\n```\r\nmulti_lamb.cu(53): error: calling a __host__ function(\"pow<float, int, (int)0> \") from a __global__ function(\"mxnet::op::KernelStep1<(bool)1, float, float> \") is not allowed\r\nmulti_lamb.cu(53): error: identifier \"pow<float, int, (int)0> \" is undefined in device code\r\n```\r\n## Checklist

swish was originally coined the \"SiLU\" in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.08415.pdf long before the swish paper. Renaming other peoples' exact same ideas is unacceptable and mxnet's naming convention implicitly erases other peoples' research. This request inspired by a [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/hkiyir/r_google_has_a_credit_assignment_problem_in/) and a recent [tensorflow issue](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/41066), but this problem has been brought up every few months for the past few years. In light of recent efforts to make the ML community more equitable and _fair_, this is a no-brainer and long overdue.\r\n\r\nThe SiLU has been added to pytorch 1.7, jax, tensorflow, and huggingface. This commit adds the silu as an activation function to mxnet.","created_at":"2020-11-09T01:31:00Z","updated_at":"2020-11-09T16:46:16Z","closed_at":"2020-11-09T16:46:15Z","merged_at":"2020-11-09T16:46:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"d4a5f2d6b478616b1692c78c5939e96423a79b0d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"aaronmarkham","id":5974205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzQyMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5974205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham","html_url":"https://github.com/aaronmarkham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nMasked softmax and log-softmax operators: they mask out values not included in the mask \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Two new operators: masked_softmax and log_masked_softmax\r\n- [x] Forward and Backward passes included\r\n- [x] Optionally, an scaling factor _s_ can be passed as parameter. Each value _x_ in the tensor will be converted into x/s\r\n- [x] Normalization by Max value (activated by default) can be deactivated. This can improve performance when no required\r\n- [x] Automatic broadcast of mask for axis with size=1 (requires same number of dimensions as input data)\r\n- [x] CPU implementation is included\r\n\r\n\r\n@sxjscience

Description ##\r\nThis is a follow-on PR after the initial investigation in #18904 to support loading libraries containing MXNet backend components (particularly operators). Since #19241, the version script was removed and now Linux builds of `libmxnet.so` expose all MXNet symbols. This opens the door for dynamically loading libraries that depend on `libmxnet.so`.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a build option `BUILD_EXTENSION` to the CMakeLists.txt file to give a path to the extension directory to build. This enables the existing MXNet build infrastructure to provide all includes directories automatically which simplifies building extensions. \r\n\r\nAn example is also added in `examples/extensions/lib_external_ops` that builds an operator that is equivalent to a built-in/backend operator into a shared object and uses the existing `mx.library.load` API to load that library at runtime. \r\n\r\n### Caveots\r\nWindows is not supported since by default all symbols are hidden in `mxnet.dll` so dynamically loading libraries will not work. Similarly with Mac, the version script does not expose the necessary symbols at this time. These other platforms can be considered in the future based on user request & community motivation.","created_at":"2020-10-27T06:57:42Z","updated_at":"2020-11-14T07:13:07Z","closed_at":"2020-11-14T07:13:06Z","merged_at":"2020-11-14T07:13:06Z","merge_commit_sha":"6bc064771d805163cd22123e9b3ec25bb55341d3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"aaronmarkham","id":5974205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzQyMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5974205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham","html_url":"https://github.com/aaronmarkham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"marcoabreu","id":18629099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI5MDk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18629099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu","html_url":"https://github.com/marcoabreu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018799529,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk5NTI5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-merge","name":"pr-awaiting-merge","color":"0e8a16","default":false,"description":"Review and CI is complete.

Description ##\r\nThis PR is a continuation of the work started in #18622. It changes the reduction operations to be compiled with runtime compilation (RTC).\r\n\r\nAs the work progresses I will update the description.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] PR's title starts with a category (e.g. [BUGFIX], [MODEL], [TUTORIAL], [FEATURE], [DOC], etc)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n - Changed reduction kernels to RTC\r\n - Removed duplication (`broadcast_reduce-inl.cuh`, `broadcast_reduce_customized-inl.h`)\r\n - Removed allocations/memcpies/synchronizations from forward of NumPy `norm` operator (`ReduceAxesComputeImplWithReducer`)\r\n - Fixed handling of workspace in backward of `kron` operator\r\n - Fixed handling of workspace in NumPy argmin/argmax operators\r\n - Fixed the logic of choosing argmin/argmax (if the values are the same, index should be lower)\r\n - During the process of working on this PR noticed bug in workspace handling in tensordot operator, filed issue #19458.","created_at":"2020-10-26T16:36:23Z","updated_at":"2021-05-25T01:38:17Z","closed_at":"2021-05-25T01:38:17Z","merged_at":"2021-05-25T01:38:17Z","merge_commit_sha":"57d0ace3a9b89032896822dd27af870a9b446d83","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"MoisesHer","id":50716238,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzE2MjM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50716238?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoisesHer","html_url":"https://github.com/MoisesHer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoisesHer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoisesHer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoisesHer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoisesHer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoisesHer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoisesHer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoisesHer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoisesHer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoisesHer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/18667 if users use the `npx.save` / `npx.savez` functions.\r\nLoading legacy parameter formats is still supported. Saving legacy parameter formats is still supported via `nd.save`.\r\n\r\nNote that `npx` functions do not support to save / load npz format from cloud storage (S3, Azure, ...) but contributions adding the feature are welcome.\r\n\r\nCompared to the prior implementation of `npx` save / load functions, legacy NDArrays (including sparse arrays) can now also be saved to the `npy` / `npz` formats by calling the `npx` functions with a legacy NDArray

Description ##\r\nOften it is desirable to use a shared c runtime when build a shared lib on windows. Third party dependencies DMLC and GTEST support this so adding support to mxnet is now easier\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\nChanged cmake file to not replace 'MD' flags with 'MT' flags if MXNET_FORCE_SHARED_CRT is enabled.\r\nMXNET_FORCE_SHARED_CRT is enabled by default if building a shared lib\r\nFixed linking for some Debug (which linked to MD instead of MDd) \r\nAdded missing RelWithDebinfo and MinSizeRel configurations which were missing in parts.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nNot sure if this should be the default when building a shared lib on windows or just an
