What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a projection when any Python UDTF TABLE argument contains PARTITION BY expressions that are not simple attributes that are already present in the output of the relation.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCREATE TABLE t(d DATE, y INT) USING PARQUET;\r\nINSERT INTO t VALUES ...\r\nSELECT * FROM UDTF(TABLE(t) PARTITION BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM d) ORDER BY y ASC);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will generate a plan like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n+- Sort (y ASC)\r\n  +- RepartitionByExpressions (partition_by_0)\r\n    +- Project (t.d, t.y, EXTRACT(YEAR FROM t.d) AS partition_by_0)\r\n      +- LogicalRelation \"t\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWe project the PARTITION BY expressions so that their resulting values

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nOn the lines of DPP which helps DataSourceV2 relations when the joining key is a partition column, the same concept can be extended over to the case where joining key is not a partition column.\r\nIn this PR, the keys available in the BroadcastHashJoinExec are pushed down to the DataSourceV2 scans in form of a SortedSet structure.\r\nFor non partition columns, the DataSources like iceberg have max/min stats on columns available at manifest level, and for formats like parquet , they have max/min stats at various data structure levels. The passed SortedSet can be used to prune using ranges at both driver level ( manifests files) as well as executor level ( while actually going through chunks , row groups etc at parquet level)\r\n\r\nIf the data is stored as Columnar Batch format , then it would not be possible to filter out individual row at DataSource level, even though we have keys.\r\nBut at the scan level, ( ColumnToRowExec) it is still possible to filter out as many rows as possible , if the query involves nested joins. Thus reducing the number of rows to join at the higher join levels.\r\n\r\nAttaching link to a presentation which outlines the idea:\r\n[Broadcast Keys pushdown](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/165Rx7i00TmAKnDJpSQLfrcrW-ShrzPy5/edit?usp=drive_link)\r\n\r\nSPIP : [SPIP-44662](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-44662)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThere is scope of improvement in the performance of Inner and Left Semi join queries when using BroadcastHashJoin\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n1) Ran TPCDS suite using iceberg as DataSource.\r\n2) Converted many of the existing Spark Query tests to also run using iceberg as data source.\r\n3) Will be adding more unit tests.","created_at":"2023-08-04T22:58:14Z","updated_at":"2023-11-20T00:19:16Z","closed_at":"2023-11-20T00:19:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f9009b0b8a3da1a6d2a19bd975d150aaf737806a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406605079,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDc5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/WEB%20UI","name":"WEB

If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n### Master PR: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/42283\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a followup to #42116. It addresses the following issues:\r\n\r\n1. When `removeListener` is called upon one listener, before the python process is left running, now it also get stopped.\r\n2. When multiple `removeListener` is called on the same listener, in non-connect mode, subsequent calls will be noop. But before this PR, in connect it actually throws an error, which doesn't align with existing behavior, this PR addresses it.\r\n3. Set the socket timeout to be None (\\infty) for `foreachBatch_worker` and `listener_worker`, because there could be a long time between each microbatch. If not setting this, the socket will timeout and won't be able to process new data.\r\n\r\n```\r\nscala> Streaming query listener worker is starting with url sc://localhost:15002/;user_id=wei.liu and sessionId 886191f0-2b64-4c44-b067-de511f04b42d.\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.9/runpy.py\", line 197, in _run_module_as_main\r\n    return _run_code(code, main_globals, None,\r\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.9/runpy.py\", line 87, in _run_code\r\n    exec(code, run_globals)\r\n  File \"/home/wei.liu/oss-spark/python/lib/pyspark.zip/pyspark/sql/connect/streaming/worker/listener_worker.py\", line 95, in <module>\r\n  File \"/home/wei.liu/oss-spark/python/lib/pyspark.zip/pyspark/sql/connect/streaming/worker/listener_worker.py\", line 82, in main\r\n  File \"/home/wei.liu/oss-spark/python/lib/pyspark.zip/pyspark/serializers.py\", line 557, in loads\r\n  File \"/home/wei.liu/oss-spark/python/lib/pyspark.zip/pyspark/serializers.py\", line 594, in read_int\r\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.9/socket.py\", line 704, in readinto\r\n    return self._sock.recv_into(b)\r\nsocket.timeout: timed out\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to downgrade the Apache Hadoop dependency to 3.3.4 in `Apache Spark 3.5` in order to prevent any regression from `Apache Spark 3.4.x`. In other words, although `Apache Spark 3.5.x` will lose many bug fixes of Apache Hadoop 3.3.5 and 3.3.6, it will be in the same situation with `Apache Spark 3.4.x`.\r\n- SPARK-44197 Upgrade Hadoop to 3.3.6 (#41744)\r\n- SPARK-42913 Upgrade Hadoop to 3.3.5 (#39124)\r\n- SPARK-43448 Remove dummy dependency `hadoop-openstack` (#41133)\r\n\r\nOn top of reverting SPARK-44197 and SPARK-42913, this PR has additional dependency exclusion change due to the following.\r\n- SPARK-43880 Organize `hadoop-cloud` in standard maven project structure (#41380)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThere is a community report on S3A committer performance regression. Although it's one liner fix, there is no available Hadoop release with that fix at this time.\r\n- HADOOP-18757: Bump corePoolSize of HadoopThreadPoolExecutor in s3a committer (https://github.com/apache/hadoop/pull/5706)\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the

Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n### Master Branch PR: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/42283\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a followup to #42116. It addresses the following issues:\r\n\r\n1. When `removeListener` is called upon one listener, before the python process is left running, now it also get stopped.\r\n2. When multiple `removeListener` is called on the same listener, in non-connect mode, subsequent calls will be noop. But before this PR, in connect it actually throws an error, which doesn't align with existing behavior, this PR addresses it.\r\n3. Set the socket timeout to be None (\\infty) for `foreachBatch_worker` and `listener_worker`, because there could be a long time between each microbatch. If not setting this, the socket will timeout and won't be able to process new data.\r\n\r\n```\r\nscala> Streaming query listener worker is starting with url sc://localhost:15002/;user_id=wei.liu and sessionId 886191f0-2b64-4c44-b067-de511f04b42d.\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.9/runpy.py\", line 197, in _run_module_as_main\r\n    return _run_code(code, main_globals, None,\r\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.9/runpy.py\", line 87, in _run_code\r\n    exec(code, run_globals)\r\n  File \"/home/wei.liu/oss-spark/python/lib/pyspark.zip/pyspark/sql/connect/streaming/worker/listener_worker.py\", line 95, in <module>\r\n  File \"/home/wei.liu/oss-spark/python/lib/pyspark.zip/pyspark/sql/connect/streaming/worker/listener_worker.py\", line 82, in main\r\n  File \"/home/wei.liu/oss-spark/python/lib/pyspark.zip/pyspark/serializers.py\", line 557, in loads\r\n  File \"/home/wei.liu/oss-spark/python/lib/pyspark.zip/pyspark/serializers.py\", line 594, in read_int\r\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.9/socket.py\", line 704, in readinto\r\n    return self._sock.recv_into(b)\r\nsocket.timeout: timed out\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR cherry-picks https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/380c0f2033fb83b5e4f13693d2576d72c5cc01f2. It improves error messages when the result of a Python UDTF is not an Iterable. It also improves the error messages when a UDTF encounters an exception when executing `eval`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo make Python UDTFs more user-friendly.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. For example this UDTF:\r\n```\r\n@udtf(returnType=\"x: int\")\r\nclass TestUDTF:\r\n    def eval(self, a):\r\n        return a \r\n```\r\nBefore this PR, it fails with this error for regular UDTFs:\r\n```\r\n    return tuple(map(verify_and_convert_result, res))\r\nTypeError: 'int' object is not iterable\r\n```\r\nAnd this error for arrow-optimized UDTFs:\r\n```\r\n    raise ValueError(\"DataFrame constructor not properly called!\")\r\nValueError: DataFrame constructor not properly called!\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, the error message will be:\r\n`pyspark.errors.exceptions.base.PySparkRuntimeError: [UDTF_RETURN_NOT_ITERABLE] The return value of the UDTF is invalid. It should be an iterable (e.g., generator or list), but got 'int'. Please make sure that the UDTF returns one of these types.`\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR adds support for pandas DataFrame in `assertDataFrameEqual` (in addition to pandas-on-Spark), while delaying all pandas imports until pandas environment dependency is verified.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe changes are needed to allow users to compare pandas DataFrame equality, while still ensuring compatibility for environments with no pandas installation.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, the PR affects the user-facing function `assertDataFrameEqual`\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded tests to `python/pyspark/sql/tests/test_utils.py` and `python/pyspark/sql/tests/connect/test_utils.py`\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-04T00:29:11Z","updated_at":"2023-08-08T23:59:38Z","closed_at":"2023-08-08T23:59:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fd09e961d377616228aa14ef300617fe8c94bec7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4138679613,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs72rz09","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PANDAS%20API%20ON%20SPARK","name":"PANDAS

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis makes sure that all iterators used in Spark Connect scala client are `CloseableIterator`.\r\n\r\n1. Makes `CustomSparkConnectBlockingStub.executePlan` return `CloseableIterator` and make all wrappers respect that.\r\n2. Makes `ExecutePlanResponseReattachableIterator` a `CloseableIterator`, with an implementation that will inform the server that query result can be released with ReleaseExecute.\r\n3. Makes `SparkResult.iterator` explicitly a `CloseableIterator`, and also register the `SparkResult.responses` iterator as with the `SparkResultCloseable` cleaner, which will make it close upon GC, if not closed explicitly sooner.\r\n4. Because `Dataset.toLocalIterator` requires a Java iterator, implement a conversion to `java.util.Iterator with AutoCloseable` to be returned there\r\n5. Using `CloseableIterator` consistently everywhere else removes the need to convert between iterator types.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nProperly closeable iterators are needed for resource management, and with reattachable execution to inform server that processing finished.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExercise current E2E tests.\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Alice Sayutina

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdds memory limits for Python UDTF analyzer.\r\n\r\n- `spark.sql.analyzer.pythonUDTF.analyzeInPython.memory` (`None` by default)\r\n\r\n> The amount of memory to be allocated to PySpark for Python UDTF analyzer, in MiB unless otherwise specified. If set, PySpark memory for Python UDTF analyzer will be limited to this amount. If not set, Spark will not limit Python's memory use and it is up to the application to avoid exceeding the overhead memory space shared with other non-JVM processes.\r\nNote: Windows does not support resource limiting and actual resource is not limited on MacOS.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nPython UDTF analyzer should be able to set a memory limit.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nUsers will be able to set the memory limit for Python UDTF analyzer.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR fixes a regression introduced in Spark 3.4.x  where  Encoders.bean is no longer able to process nested beans having type arguments. For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass A<T> {\r\n   T value;\r\n   // value getter and setter\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass B {\r\n   A<String> stringHolder;\r\n   // stringHolder getter and setter\r\n}\r\n\r\nEncoders.bean(B.class); // throws \"SparkUnsupportedOperationException: [ENCODER_NOT_FOUND]...\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nJavaTypeInference.encoderFor main match does not manage ParameterizedType and TypeVariable cases. I think this is a regression introduced after getting rid of usage of guava TypeToken: [SPARK-42093 SQL Move JavaTypeInference to AgnosticEncoders](https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/18672003513d5a4aa610b6b94dbbc15c33185d3#diff-1191737b908340a2f4c22b71b1c40ebaa0da9d8b40c958089c346a3bda26943b) @hvanhovell @cloud-fan \r\n\r\nIn this PR I'm leveraging commons lang3 TypeUtils functionalities to solve ParameterizedType type arguments for classes\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests have been extended to check correct encoding of a nested bean having type arguments.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR makes sure we use unique partition values when calculating the final partitions in `BatchScanExec`, to make sure no duplicated partitions are generated.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWhen `spark.sql.sources.v2.bucketing.pushPartValues.enabled` and `spark.sql.sources.v2.bucketing.partiallyClusteredDistribution.enabled` are enabled, and SPJ is not triggered, currently Spark will generate incorrect/duplicated results. \r\n\r\nThis is because with both configs enabled, Spark will delay the partition grouping until the time it calculates the final partitions used by the input RDD. To calculate the partitions, it uses partition values from the `KeyGroupedPartitioning` to find out the right ordering for the partitions. However, since grouping is not done when the partition values is computed, there could be duplicated partition values. This means the result could contain duplicated partitions too.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo, this is a bug fix.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded a new test case for this scenario.","created_at":"2023-08-03T18:33:13Z","updated_at":"2023-08-08T02:20:34Z","closed_at":"2023-08-08T02:16:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9eb392dd68d95f5d21eeea25a0cc430c5ca9520d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42324/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42324/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/42324/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0d44668643fde984c1a1ba041b5def37eb98bc38","head":{"label":"sunchao:SPARK-44641","ref":"SPARK-44641","sha":"0d44668643fde984c1a1ba041b5def37eb98bc38","user":{"login":"sunchao","id":506679,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506679?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao","html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":29795757,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTc5NTc1Nw==","name":"spark","full_name":"sunchao/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sunchao","id":506679,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506679?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao","html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sunchao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sunchao/spark","description":"Mirror

Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nFixes the limit checking of `maxEstimatedBatchSize` and `maxRecordsPerBatch` to respect the more restrictive limit and fixes the config parsing of `CONNECT_GRPC_ARROW_MAX_BATCH_SIZE` by converting the value to bytes.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nBugfix. \r\nIn the arrow writer [code](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/6161bf44f40f8146ea4c115c788fd4eaeb128769/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/arrow/ArrowConverters.scala#L154-L163) , the conditions don’t seem to hold what the documentation says regd \"maxBatchSize and maxRecordsPerBatch, respect whatever smaller\" since it seems to actually respect the conf which is \"larger\" (i.e less restrictive) due to || operator.\r\n\r\n\r\nFurther, when the `CONNECT_GRPC_ARROW_MAX_BATCH_SIZE` conf is read, the value is not converted to bytes from MiB ([example](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/3e5203c64c06cc8a8560dfa0fb6f52e74589b583/connector/connect/server/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/connect/execution/SparkConnectPlanExecution.scala#L103)).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFollow-up to https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/42298\r\n\r\nThis makes sure that iterators processed through SparkResult are also properly closed.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, this introduces the following changes:\r\n1. SparkResult recognises CloseableIterators and will call close on them when destructed.\r\n2. ExecutePlanResponseReattachableIterator becomes CloseableIterator which consumes all it's elements when closed\r\n3. The client code is refactored to not use mix of java.util.Iterator and scala Iterator. In the current code there is a lot of logic processing iterators both before and after they are converted from java to scala, this moves the conversion much earlier in iterator lifetime to make almost all the code work with scala iterators only.\r\n4. CloseableIterator moved one level up\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nProperly closeable iterators are needed for session reconnection.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, Spark runtime filter supports multi level shuffle join side as filter creation side. Please see: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/39170. Although this feature adds the adaptive scene and improves the performance, there are still need to support other case.\r\n\r\n**Optimization of Expression Transitivity on the Creation Side of Spark Runtime Filter**\r\n\r\n**Principle**\r\nAssociation expressions are transitive in some Joins, such as:\r\n`Tab1.col1A = Tab2.col2B` and `Tab2.col2B = Tab3.col3C`\r\nActually, it can be inferred that `Tab1.col1A = Tab3.col3C`.\r\n\r\n**Optimization points**\r\nCurrently, the runtime filter's creation side expression only uses directly associated keys. If the transitivity of association conditions is utilized, runtime filters can be injected into many scenarios, such as:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT *\r\nFROM (\r\n  SELECT *\r\n  FROM tab1\r\n    JOIN tab2 ON tab1.c1 = tab2.c2\r\n  WHERE tab2.a2 = 5\r\n) AS a\r\n  JOIN tab3 ON tab3.c3 = a.c1\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `tab3.c3` here is only associated with `tab1.c1` and not with `tab2.c2`. Although there is selective filtering on tab2 (`tab2.a2 = 5`), Spark is currently unable to inject a Runtime Filter.\r\nAs long as transitivity is considered, we can know that `tab3.c3` and `tab2.c2` are related, so we can still inject Runtime Filter and improve performance.\r\n\r\nFor the current implementation, Spark only inject runtime filter into tab1 with bloom filter based on `bf2.a2 = 5`.\r\nBecause there is no the join between tab3 and tab2, so Spark can't inject runtime filter into tab3 with the same bloom filter.\r\nBut the above SQL have the join condition `tab3.c3 = a.c1(tab1.c1)` between tab3 and tab2, and also have the join condition `tab1.c1 = tab2.c2`. We can rely on the transitivity of the join condition to get the virtual join condition `tab3.c3 = tab2.c2`, then we can inject the bloom filter based on `bf2.a2 = 5` into tab3.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nEnhance the Spark runtime filter and improve performance.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n'No'.\r\nJust update the inner implementation.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew tests.\r\nMicro benchmark for q75 in TPC-DS.\r\n**2TB TPC-DS**\r\n| TPC-DS Query   | Before(Seconds)  | After(Seconds)  | Speedup(Percent)  |\r\n|  ----  | ----  | ----  | ----  |\r\n| q75 | 129.664 | 81.562 | 58.98%

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis merges #39952 into 3.5 branch.\r\n\r\nSimilar to #38223, improve the error messages when a Python method provided to `DataFrame.mapInPandas` returns a Pandas DataFrame that does not match the expected schema.\r\n\r\nWith\r\n```Python\r\ndf = spark.range(2).withColumn(\"v\", col(\"id\"))\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Mismatching column names:**\r\n```Python\r\ndf.mapInPandas(lambda it: it, \"id long, val long\").show()\r\n# was: KeyError: 'val'\r\n# now: RuntimeError: Column names of the returned pandas.DataFrame do not match specified schema.\r\n#      Missing: val  Unexpected: v\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Python function not returning iterator:**\r\n```Python\r\ndf.mapInPandas(lambda it: 1, \"id long\").show()\r\n# was: TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable\r\n# now: TypeError: Return type of the user-defined function should be iterator of pandas.DataFrame, but is <class 'int'>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Python function not returning iterator of pandas.DataFrame:**\r\n```Python\r\ndf.mapInPandas(lambda it: [1], \"id long\").show()\r\n# was: TypeError: Return type of the user-defined function should be Pandas.DataFrame, but is <class 'int'>\r\n# now: TypeError: Return type of the user-defined function should be iterator of pandas.DataFrame, but is iterator of <class 'int'>\r\n# sometimes: ValueError: A field of type StructType expects a pandas.DataFrame, but got: <class 'list'>\r\n# now: TypeError: Return type of the user-defined function should be iterator of pandas.DataFrame, but is iterator of <class 'list'>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Mismatching types (ValueError and TypeError):**\r\n```Python\r\ndf.mapInPandas(lambda it: it, \"id int, v string\").show()\r\n# was: pyarrow.lib.ArrowTypeError: Expected a string or bytes dtype, got int64\r\n# now: pyarrow.lib.ArrowTypeError: Expected a string or bytes dtype, got int64\r\n#      The above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:\r\n#      TypeError: Exception thrown when converting pandas.Series (int64) with name 'v' to Arrow Array (string).\r\n\r\ndf.mapInPandas(lambda it: [pdf.assign(v=pdf[\"v\"].apply(str)) for pdf in it], \"id int, v double\").show()\r\n# was: pyarrow.lib.ArrowInvalid: Could not convert '0' with type str: tried to convert to double\r\n# now: pyarrow.lib.ArrowInvalid: Could not convert '0' with type str: tried to convert to double\r\n#      The above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:\r\n#      ValueError: Exception thrown when converting pandas.Series (object) with name 'v' to Arrow Array (double).\r\n\r\nwith self.sql_conf({\"spark.sql.execution.pandas.convertToArrowArraySafely\": True}):\r\n  df.mapInPandas(lambda it: [pdf.assign(v=pdf[\"v\"].apply(str)) for pdf in it], \"id int, v double\").show()\r\n# was: ValueError: Exception thrown when converting pandas.Series (object) to Arrow Array (double).\r\n#      It can be caused by overflows or other unsafe conversions warned by Arrow. Arrow safe type check can be disabled\r\n#      by using SQL config `spark.sql.execution.pandas.convertToArrowArraySafely`.\r\n# now: ValueError: Exception thrown when converting pandas.Series (object) with name 'v' to Arrow Array (double).\r\n#      It can be caused by overflows or other unsafe conversions warned by Arrow. Arrow safe type check can be disabled\r\n#      by using SQL config `spark.sql.execution.pandas.convertToArrowArraySafely`.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nExisting errors are generic (`KeyError`) or meaningless (`'int' object is not iterable`). The errors should help users in spotting the mismatching columns by naming them.\r\n\r\nThe schema of the returned Pandas DataFrames can only be checked during processing the DataFrame, so such errors are very expensive. Therefore, they should be expressive.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nThis only changes error messages, not behaviour.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTests all cases of schema mismatch for `DataFrame.mapInPandas`.","created_at":"2023-08-03T07:27:14Z","updated_at":"2023-08-04T01:38:45Z","closed_at":"2023-08-04T01:38:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"36949b543ee430bae1d7212bbb5834796f78f422","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4138679613,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs72rz09","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PANDAS%20API%20ON%20SPARK","name":"PANDAS

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nWe have a long-standing tricky optimization in `Dataset.union`, which invokes the optimizer rule `CombineUnions` to pre-optimize the analyzed plan. This is to avoid too large analyzed plan for a specific dataframe query pattern `df1.union(df2).union(df3).union...`.\r\n\r\nThis tricky optimization is designed to break dataframe caching, but we thought it was fine as people usually won't cache the intermediate dataframe in a union chain. However, `CombineUnions` gets improved from time to time (e.g. https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/35214) and now it can optimize a wide range of Union patterns. Now it's possible that people union two dataframe, do something with `select`, and cache it. Then the dataframe is unioned again with other dataframes and people expect the df cache to work. However the cache won't work due to the tricky optimization in `Dataset.union`.\r\n\r\nThis PR updates `Dataset.union` to only combine adjacent Unions to match the original purpose.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFix perf regression due to breaking df caching\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/42235 that fixes the Connect related import after the dependency checking.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn order to show the end users a nice error message for optional dependencies instead of just saying that they were not found.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, the PR has not been released out yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually.","created_at":"2023-08-02T23:41:41Z","updated_at":"2024-01-15T00:48:23Z","closed_at":"2023-08-02T23:56:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"adb2a197abcf2f9313c17ba0a7c379acc8874479","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42311/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42311/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/42311/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7656dae65a356b4ab54af037dc7428742e66ac78","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-44424-folowup","ref":"SPARK-44424-folowup","sha":"7656dae65a356b4ab54af037dc7428742e66ac78","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n- Add new conf spark.sql.sources.v2.bucketing.allowJoinKeysSubsetOfPartitionKeys.enabled\r\n- Change key compatibility checks in EnsureRequirements.  Remove checks where all partition keys must be in join keys to allow isKeyCompatible = true in this case (if this flag is enabled)\r\n- Change BatchScanExec/DataSourceV2Relation to group splits by join keys if they differ from partition keys (previously grouped only by partition values).  Do same for all auxiliary data structure, like commonPartValues.\r\n- Implement partiallyClustered skew-handling.\r\n  - Group only the replicate side (now by join key as well), replicate by the total size of other-side partitions that share the join key.\r\n  - add an additional sort for partitions based on join key, as when we group the replicate side, partition ordering becomes out of order from the non-replicate side.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n- Support Storage Partition Join in cases where the join condition does not contain all the partition keys, but just some of them\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change? \r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested? \r\n-Added tests in KeyGroupedPartitioningSuite\r\n-Found two existing problems, will address in separate PR:\r\n- Because of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/37886   we have to select all join keys to trigger SPJ in this case, otherwise DSV2 scan does not report KeyGroupedPartitioning and SPJ does not get triggered.  Need to see how to relax this.\r\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-44641 was found when testing this change.  This pr refactors some of those code to add group-by-join-key, but doesnt change the underlying logic, so issue continues to exist.  Hopefully this will also get fixed in another way.","created_at":"2023-08-02T22:43:16Z","updated_at":"2023-11-20T16:38:38Z","closed_at":"2023-09-11T18:19:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"35e4a68334dba416baf1889618593ff4df4b9ed5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42306/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42306/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/42306/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e83265293869c232a79b302bea002f82f6623920","head":{"label":"szehon-ho:spj_attempt_master","ref":"spj_attempt_master","sha":"e83265293869c232a79b302bea002f82f6623920","user":{"login":"szehon-ho","id":20555759,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTU1NzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20555759?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho","html_url":"https://github.com/szehon-ho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":647563706,"node_id":"R_kgDOJpkJug","name":"spark","full_name":"szehon-ho/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"szehon-ho","id":20555759,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTU1NzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20555759?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho","html_url":"https://github.com/szehon-ho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szehon-ho/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/szehon-ho/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nClient:\r\nWhen server returns error on the response stream via onError, the ExecutePlanResponseReattachableIterator will not see the stream finish with a ResultsComplete. Instead, a StatusRuntimeException will be thrown from next() or hasNext(). Handle catching that exception, telling the server to ReleaseExecute when we receive it, and rethrow it to the user.\r\n\r\nServer:\r\nWe also have to tweak the behaviour of ReleaseAll to also interrupt the query. The previous behaviour that in case of a running query one has to first send an interrupt, and then release was done to prevent race conditions of an interrupt coming after ResultComplete. Now, this has been resolved with proper synchronization at the final moments of execution in ExecuteThreadRunner, and as we want the release to be async, having one ReleaseExecutel vs. needing a combination of Interrupt+ReleaseExecute simplifies things.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIf ReleaseExecute is not called by the client to acknowledge that the error was received, the

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR improves error messages when the result of a Python UDTF is not an Iterable. It also improves the error messages when a UDTF encounters an exception when executing `eval`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo make Python UDTFs more user-friendly.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. For example this UDTF:\r\n```\r\n@udtf(returnType=\"x: int\")\r\nclass TestUDTF:\r\n    def eval(self, a):\r\n        return a \r\n```\r\nBefore this PR, it fails with this error for regular UDTFs:\r\n```\r\n    return tuple(map(verify_and_convert_result, res))\r\nTypeError: 'int' object is not iterable\r\n```\r\nAnd this error for arrow-optimized UDTFs:\r\n```\r\n    raise ValueError(\"DataFrame constructor not properly called!\")\r\nValueError: DataFrame constructor not properly called!\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, the error message will be:\r\n`pyspark.errors.exceptions.base.PySparkRuntimeError: [UDTF_RETURN_NOT_ITERABLE] The return value of the UDTF is invalid. It should be an iterable (e.g., generator or list), but got 'int'. Please make sure that the UDTF returns one of these types.`\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nNew

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nUpdate the RocksDB state store to store its local data underneath `java.io.tmpdir` instead of going through `Utils.getLocalDir` when running on Yarn. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nOn YARN, the local RocksDB directory is placed in a directory created inside the root application folder such as\r\n\r\n```\r\n/tmp/nm-local-dir/usercache/<user>/appcache/<app_id>/spark-<uuid>/StateStoreId(...)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem with this is that if an executor crashes for some reason (like OOM) and the shutdown hooks don't get run, this directory will stay around forever until the application finishes, which can cause jobs to slowly accumulate more and more temporary space until finally the node manager goes unhealthy.\r\n\r\nBecause this data will only ever be accessed by the executor that created this directory, it would make sense to store the data inside the container folder, which will always get cleaned up by the node manager when that yarn container gets cleaned up. Yarn sets the `java.io.tmpdir` to a path inside this directory, such as\r\n\r\n```\r\n/tmp/nm-local-dir/usercache/<user>/appcache/<app_id>/<container_id>/tmp/StateStoreId(...)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt looks like only Yarn setts the tmpdir property, and other resource managers (standalone and k8s) always rely on the local dirs setting/env vars. I went back and forth on whether to add a new Util function (i.e. `getExecutorLocalDir`) or add a flag to `getLocalDir`, but just kept it local to the RocksDB provider for now. There may be more use cases where it makes more sense to use the tmpdir on Yarn rather than the local dirs for things that don't need to persist beyond executor shutdown.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nShouldn't be any effective changes, other than preventing disk space from filling up on Node Managers under certain scenarios.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFunction `removeResponsesUntilId` is used by `ReleaseExecute` RPC, and that needs to be synchronized against `removeCachedResponses` running from `consumeResponse` for `ExecutePlan` or `ReattachExecute` RPC.\r\n\r\nIn general, all public accesses to ExecuteResponseObserver should best be synchronized.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFix synchronization bug caught by testing of python client.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nCaught in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/42235, but want to fix separately because this is a server side

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nMinorly refactored execute functions to not leave dangling iterators\r\n\r\n(Note: we also should do that with SparkResult, however in almost all cases there should be no problem with iterators not consumed).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nNeeded for ongoing work regarding session reattachment.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThis is intended to be tested after session reattachment is complete (cc

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nRemove executor pod from `schedulerKnownNewlyCreatedExecs` in `ExecutorPodsAllocator` if schedulerBackend no longer knows about that executor.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIf executor was created and removed in a short period, then it is possible that the creation was not captured by any snapshots. In this case, we should remove the executor from schedulerKnownNewlyCreatedExecs list, otherwise it will get stuck in the list and new executor will never be requested.\r\n\r\n(This can often happen if watch connection is closed for some reason and driver has to fallback on `ExecutorPodsPollingSnapshotSource`)\r\n\r\nPlease check [jira issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-44609) to get more details\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Unit tests `test(\"SPARK-44609: Do not track an executor if it was removed from scheduler backend.\")`\r\n- Tested locally by disabling informers and manually killing executor pods and seeing the new ones coming up within the `spark.kubernetes.executor.apiPollingInterval` 30s\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-02T12:15:40Z","updated_at":"2024-05-10T00:19:22Z","closed_at":"2024-05-10T00:19:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7cec00cc8627c40d3be5b97a5bd44536a88017e4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605057,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/KUBERNETES","name":"KUBERNETES","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42297/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42297/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/42297/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/caaa4bb73bf8fdfd4b0e1f9c571ce62550333621","head":{"label":"alibiyeslambek:spark-44609","ref":"spark-44609","sha":"caaa4bb73bf8fdfd4b0e1f9c571ce62550333621","user":{"login":"alibiyeslambek","id":32357332,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzU3MzMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32357332?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alibiyeslambek","html_url":"https://github.com/alibiyeslambek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alibiyeslambek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alibiyeslambek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alibiyeslambek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alibiyeslambek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alibiyeslambek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alibiyeslambek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alibiyeslambek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alibiyeslambek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alibiyeslambek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":673777055,"node_id":"R_kgDOKCkFnw","name":"spark","full_name":"alibiyeslambek/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"alibiyeslambek","id":32357332,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzU3MzMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32357332?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alibiyeslambek","html_url":"https://github.com/alibiyeslambek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alibiyeslambek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alibiyeslambek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alibiyeslambek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alibiyeslambek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alibiyeslambek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alibiyeslambek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alibiyeslambek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alibiyeslambek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alibiyeslambek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/alibiyeslambek/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis change tries to handle shuffle fetch failures due to decommissions.\r\n\r\nWhen encountering a fetch failure for a block, `ShuffleBlockFetcherIterator` will check the updated map output location (`BlockManagerId`) for it, and see if the location changes. When it does, the fetch failure will be ignored and the updated location and the block id will be recorded. At the end of the fetch request (when all blocks in the request are processed), multiple requests will be assembled and enqueued, to retry the fetches from the updated locations for the corresponding blocks.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis is to improve stability when decommission is enabled.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nThis change comes with a feature flag `spark.storage.decommission.shuffleBlocks.refreshLocationsEnabled`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded a new unit test.\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-02T11:01:47Z","updated_at":"2025-01-08T01:35:39Z","closed_at":"2024-04-29T00:19:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6d356340b47bdaad82179397e3bbc53908ea9571","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42296/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42296/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/42296/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8188981a1e4cf77bc3a3a8b9465c1705bd0cf995","head":{"label":"bozhang2820:spark-44635","ref":"spark-44635","sha":"8188981a1e4cf77bc3a3a8b9465c1705bd0cf995","user":{"login":"bozhang2820","id":44179472,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTc5NDcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44179472?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820","html_url":"https://github.com/bozhang2820","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":295316675,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTUzMTY2NzU=","name":"spark","full_name":"bozhang2820/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bozhang2820","id":44179472,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTc5NDcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44179472?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820","html_url":"https://github.com/bozhang2820","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bozhang2820/spark","description":"Apache

If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nfix the bug in issue [SPARK-44581](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-44581)\r\n\r\n**Bug:**\r\nIn spark3.2 it throws the org.apache.hadoop.security.AccessControlException, but in spark2.4 this hook does not throw exception.\r\n\r\n\r\nI rebuild the hadoop-client-api.jar, and add some debug log before the hadoop shutdown hook is created, and rebuild the spark-yarn.jar to add some debug log when creating the spark shutdown hook manager, here is the screenshot of the log: \r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/62563545/ea338db3-646c-432c-bf16-1f445adc2ad9)\r\n\r\n\r\nWe can see from the screenshot, the ShutdownHookManager is initialized before the ApplicationManager create a new ugi.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Reason**\r\n\r\nThe main cause is that ShutdownHook thread is created before we create the ugi in ApplicationMaster.\r\n\r\nWhen we set the config key \"hadoop.security.credential.provider.path\", the ApplicationMaster will try to get a filesystem when generating SSLOptions, and when initialize the filesystem during which it will generate a new thread whose ugi is inherited from the current process (yarn).\r\nAfter this, it will generate a new ugi (SPARK_USER) in ApplicationMaster and execute the doAs() function.\r\n\r\nHere is the chain of the call:\r\nApplicationMaster.(ApplicationMaster.scala:83) -> org.apache.spark.SecurityManager.(SecurityManager.scala:98) -> org.apache.spark.SSLOptions$.parse(SSLOptions.scala:188) -> org.apache.hadoop.conf.Configuration.getPassword(Configuration.java:2353) -> org.apache.hadoop.conf.Configuration.getPasswordFromCredentialProviders(Configuration.java:2434) -> org.apache.hadoop.security.alias.CredentialProviderFactory.getProviders(CredentialProviderFactory.java:82)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI didn't add new UnitTest for this, but I rebuild the package, and runs a program in my cluster, and turns out that the user when I delete the staging file turns to be the same with the SPARK_USER.\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-02T10:22:26Z","updated_at":"2023-08-09T02:48:13Z","closed_at":"2023-08-09T02:48:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"46ab975899de364662d1852212fb680dd7a8d860","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1427970157,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDI3OTcwMTU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/YARN","name":"YARN","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1982110661,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMTEwNjYx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/INFRA","name":"INFRA","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42295/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42295/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/42295/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/34b5dd32907cf8b52f241ef81e4c284bbe64cd1f","head":{"label":"liangyu-1:SPARK-44581","ref":"SPARK-44581","sha":"34b5dd32907cf8b52f241ef81e4c284bbe64cd1f","user":{"login":"liangyu-1","id":62563545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNTYzNTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62563545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangyu-1","html_url":"https://github.com/liangyu-1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangyu-1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangyu-1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangyu-1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangyu-1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangyu-1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangyu-1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangyu-1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangyu-1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangyu-1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":667729839,"node_id":"R_kgDOJ8y_rw","name":"spark","full_name":"liangyu-1/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"liangyu-1","id":62563545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNTYzNTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62563545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangyu-1","html_url":"https://github.com/liangyu-1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangyu-1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangyu-1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangyu-1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangyu-1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangyu-1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangyu-1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangyu-1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangyu-1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liangyu-1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/liangyu-1/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe following situation exists in the Spark code:\r\n1. The `repl` module depends on the `core` module, which in turn depends on the `common/network-common` module.\r\n2. The `common/network-common` module will perform `shade+relocation` operation on the guava dependency (dependency scope is compile), while `core` will only perform `relocation` operation on the Guava dependency (dependency scope is provided)\r\n\r\n\r\nSo when we conduct Maven tests on the `repl` module, it is necessary to depend on both the jar package of `core` module and `common/network-common` module or both `target/classes` directory of `core` module and `common/network-common` module, and when the Maven test command leads to the dependence on the jar package of `core` module and  `target/classes` directory of `common/network-common` module, test failures will occure due to `shade+relocation` issue.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\nif we run `build/mvn test -pl common/network-common,repl` \r\n\r\nThe test `Dependencies classpath` is `/Users/yangjie01/.m2/repository/org/apache/spark/spark-core_2.12/4.0.0-SNAPSHOT/spark-core_2.12-4.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar:.../Users/yangjie01/SourceCode/git/spark-mine-12/common/network-common/target/scala-2.12/classes:...`\r\n\r\n`repl` module test failed as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n*** RUN ABORTED ***\r\n  java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/sparkproject/guava/cache/CacheLoader\r\n  at org.apache.spark.SparkConf.loadFromSystemProperties(SparkConf.scala:75)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.SparkConf.<init>(SparkConf.scala:70)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.SparkConf.<init>(SparkConf.scala:59)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.repl.Main$.<init>(Main.scala:37)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.repl.Main$.<clinit>(Main.scala)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.repl.ReplSuite.$anonfun$new$1(ReplSuite.scala:94)\r\n  at org.scalatest.enablers.Timed$$anon$1.timeoutAfter(Timed.scala:127)\r\n  at org.scalatest.concurrent.TimeLimits$.failAfterImpl(TimeLimits.scala:282)\r\n  at org.scalatest.concurrent.TimeLimits.failAfter(TimeLimits.scala:231)\r\n  at org.scalatest.concurrent.TimeLimits.failAfter$(TimeLimits.scala:230)\r\n  ...\r\n  Cause: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.sparkproject.guava.cache.CacheLoader\r\n  at java.net.URLClassLoader.findClass(URLClassLoader.java:387)\r\n  at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:419)\r\n  at sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader.loadClass(Launcher.java:352)\r\n  at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:352)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.SparkConf.loadFromSystemProperties(SparkConf.scala:75)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.SparkConf.<init>(SparkConf.scala:70)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.SparkConf.<init>(SparkConf.scala:59)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.repl.Main$.<init>(Main.scala:37)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.repl.Main$.<clinit>(Main.scala)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.repl.ReplSuite.$anonfun$new$1(ReplSuite.scala:94)\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe test failed due to `core.jar` already relocation Guava class path, but the content in `network-common/target/scala-2.12/classes ` has not yet undergone `shaded + relocation` for Guava, the is determined by the lifecycle executed by Maven.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut when we execute `build/mvn clean install -pl common/network-common,repl` \r\n\r\nThe test `Dependencies classpath` is `/Users/yangjie01/.m2/repository/org/apache/spark/spark-core_2.12/4.0.0-SNAPSHOT/spark-core_2.12-4.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar:.../Users/yangjie01/SourceCode/git/spark-mine-12/common/network-common/target/spark-network-common_2.12-4.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar:...`\r\n\r\nAnd All tests passed.\r\n\r\nThe failure of the `repl` module test in the Maven daily test is due to similar reason: https://github.com/apache/spark/actions/runs/5751080986/job/15589117861\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1479\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/1475305/be385810-2173-4b77-898d-0f452ce65088\">\r\n\r\n\r\nThe possible solutions are as follows:\r\n1. Force the use of `network-common.jar` as a test dependency in the above scenario during Maven testing, but I haven’t found a solution that can be confirmed as viable (consulted gpt-4)\r\n2. Make the `core` module also perform shading on Guava, but this would increase the size of the core.jar by 15+% (14660516 bytes -> 16871122 bytes)\r\n3. Move the `common/network-common` module to a separate group for testing to avoid similar problems, but this would waste some GA resources.\r\n4. Move the `repl` module to another group to avoid this issue, but the remaining modules in the original group need to ensure that they can pass the test.\r\n\r\n\r\nUltimately, this PR chose method 4, moving the `repl` module and `hive-thriftserver` into the same group, while also verifying through GAthat the `repl` module and the original group can both pass the test.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nMake `repl` module to pass Maven daily testing. After this PR, only the `connector/connect/client/jvm` and `connector/connect/server` modules will have Maven test failures.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, just for test.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Verified and passed using GitHub Action.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/LuciferYang/spark/actions/runs/5745978299/job/15580477796\r\n\r\n<img

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR cherry-picks https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/5384f4601a4ba8daba76d67e945eaa6fc2b70b2c. It improves error messages when the output of an arrow-optimized Python UDTF cannot be casted to the specified return schema of the UDTF.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo make Python UDTFs more user-friendly.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, before this PR, when the output of a UDTF fails to cast to the desired schema, Spark will throw this confusing error message:\r\n```python\r\n@udtf(returnType=\"x: int\")\r\nclass TestUDTF:\r\n    def eval(self):\r\n        yield [1, 2],\r\n\r\nTestUDTF().collect()\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n  File \"pyarrow/array.pxi\", line 1044, in pyarrow.lib.Array.from_pandas\r\n  File \"pyarrow/array.pxi\", line 316, in pyarrow.lib.array\r\n  File \"pyarrow/array.pxi\", line 83, in pyarrow.lib._ndarray_to_array\r\n  File \"pyarrow/error.pxi\", line 100, in pyarrow.lib.check_status\r\npyarrow.lib.ArrowInvalid: Could not convert [1, 2] with type list: tried to convert to int32\r\n```\r\nNow, after this PR, the error message will look like this:\r\n`pyspark.errors.exceptions.base.PySparkRuntimeError: [UDTF_ARROW_TYPE_CAST_ERROR] Cannot convert the output value of the column 'x' with type 'object' to the specified return type of the column: 'int32'. Please check if the data types match and try again.\r\n`\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nNew unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to remove session-based directories when the isolated session is evicted from the cache.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSPARK-44078 added the cache for isolated sessions, and SPARK-44348 added the session-based directory for isolation.\r\nWhen the isolated session cache is evicted, we should remove the session-based directory so it doesn't fail when the same session is used, see also https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/41625#discussion_r1251427466\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo to end users since the feature has not been released yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI manually tested as described in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/41292. Especially, I reduced the TTL to few minutes, and tested as below at the last step:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nspark.range(10).select(plug_one(\"id\")).show()\r\nspark.range(10).select(plug_one(\"id\")).show()\r\n# Wait few minutes\r\nspark.range(10).select(plug_one(\"id\")).show()\r\n```\r\n\r\nI verified that the same session can be added back to the cache, and creates the directory with the same name by reading executor's stderr at Spark

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe subDir in the memory cache could be stale, for example, after a damaged disk repair or replacement. This dir could be accessed subsequently by others. Especially,  `filename` generated by `RDDBlockId` is unchanged between task reties, so it probably attempts to access the same subDir repeatedly. Therefore, it is necessary to check if the subDir exists. If it is stale and the hardware has been recovered without data and directories, we will recreate the subDir to prevent FileNotFoundException during writing.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds an existence checker for cache sub dir entry.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

When multiple `removeListener` is called on the same listener, in non-connect mode, subsequent calls will be noop. But before this PR, in connect it actually throws an error, which doesn't align with existing behavior, this PR addresses it.\r\n3. Set the socket timeout to be None (\\infty) for `foreachBatch_worker` and `listener_worker`, because there could be a long time between each microbatch. If not setting this, the socket will timeout and won't be able to process new data.\r\n\r\n```\r\nscala> Streaming query listener worker is starting with url sc://localhost:15002/;user_id=wei.liu and sessionId 886191f0-2b64-4c44-b067-de511f04b42d.\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.9/runpy.py\", line 197, in _run_module_as_main\r\n    return _run_code(code, main_globals, None,\r\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.9/runpy.py\", line 87, in _run_code\r\n    exec(code, run_globals)\r\n  File \"/home/wei.liu/oss-spark/python/lib/pyspark.zip/pyspark/sql/connect/streaming/worker/listener_worker.py\", line 95, in <module>\r\n  File \"/home/wei.liu/oss-spark/python/lib/pyspark.zip/pyspark/sql/connect/streaming/worker/listener_worker.py\", line 82, in main\r\n  File \"/home/wei.liu/oss-spark/python/lib/pyspark.zip/pyspark/serializers.py\", line 557, in loads\r\n  File \"/home/wei.liu/oss-spark/python/lib/pyspark.zip/pyspark/serializers.py\", line 594, in read_int\r\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.9/socket.py\", line 704, in readinto\r\n    return self._sock.recv_into(b)\r\nsocket.timeout: timed out\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nRemoved keep alive feature in `SparkConnectStreamingQueryCache` so that the session mapping of running queries can expire after a client session times out. This is needed for a change to terminate the query when client session is timed out.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a followup of https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-44432. Without removing the keep alive feature, the session mapping for running queries cannot expire correctly since it would be accessed periodically\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nDid manual testing and verified the change is working as expected. Adding unit test is kind of hard since the session mapping logic cannot be easily mocked. We want to get this checked in with Spark 3.5 asap and this is already verified with a manual testing.\r\n\r\nCreate a streaming query on client side and then disconnect:\r\n```\r\n@ val q = spark.readStream.format(\"rate\").load().writeStream.format(\"console\").start()\r\n\r\n@ exit\r\n```\r\n\r\nValidate on server side that the running query is stopped after a while:\r\n```\r\n23/08/01

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFix double encryption issue for migrated shuffle blocks\r\n\r\nShuffle blocks upon migration are sent without decryption when io.encryption is enabled. The code on the receiving side ends up using serializer.wrapStream on the OutputStream to the file which results in the already encrypted bytes being encrypted again when the bytes are written out.\r\n\r\nThis patch removes the usage of serializerManager.wrapStream on the receiving side and also adds tests that validate that this works as expected. I have also validated that the added tests will fail if the fix is not in place.\r\n\r\nJira ticket with more details: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-44588\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nMigrated shuffle blocks will be double encrypted when `spark.io.encryption = true` without this fix.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests were added to test shuffle block migration with spark.io.encryption enabled and also fixes a test helper method to properly construct the SerializerManager with the encryption

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFix double encryption issue for migrated shuffle blocks\r\n\r\nShuffle blocks upon migration are sent without decryption when io.encryption is enabled. The code on the receiving side ends up using serializer.wrapStream on the OutputStream to the file which results in the already encrypted bytes being encrypted again when the bytes are written out.\r\n\r\nThis patch removes the usage of serializerManager.wrapStream on the receiving side and also adds tests that validate that this works as expected. I have also validated that the added tests will fail if the fix is not in place.\r\n\r\nJira ticket with more details: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-44588\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nMigrated shuffle blocks will be double encrypted when `spark.io.encryption = true` without this fix.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests were added to test shuffle block migration with spark.io.encryption enabled and also fixes a test helper method to properly construct the SerializerManager with the encryption

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFix double encryption issue for migrated shuffle blocks\r\n\r\nShuffle blocks upon migration are sent without decryption when io.encryption is enabled. The code on the receiving side ends up using serializer.wrapStream on the OutputStream to the file which results in the already encrypted bytes being encrypted again when the bytes are written out.\r\n\r\nThis patch removes the usage of serializerManager.wrapStream on the receiving side and also adds tests that validate that this works as expected. I have also validated that the added tests will fail if the fix is not in place.\r\n\r\nJira ticket with more details: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-44588\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nMigrated shuffle blocks will be double encrypted when `spark.io.encryption = true` without this fix.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests were added to test shuffle block migration with spark.io.encryption enabled and also fixes a test helper method to properly construct the SerializerManager with the encryption

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR eases some restriction of LCA resolution regarding queries with having.\r\n\r\nPreviously LCA won't rewrite (to the new plan shape) when the whole queries contains `UnresolvedHaving`, in case it breaks the plan shape of `UnresolvedHaving - Aggregate` that can be recognized by other rules. But this limitation is too strict and it causes some deadlock in having - lca - window queries. See https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-42936 for more details and examples.\r\n\r\nWith this PR, it will only skip LCA resolution on the `Aggregate` whose direct parent is `UnresolvedHaving`. This is enabled by a new bottom-up resolution without using the transform or resolve utility function.\r\n\r\nThis PR also recognizes a vulnerability related to `TEMP_RESOVLED_COLUMN` and comments in the code. It should be considered as future work.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nMore complete functionality and better user experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew tests.\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-01T22:06:05Z","updated_at":"2023-08-08T09:07:18Z","closed_at":"2023-08-08T09:07:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5e8efa283e9839e1518c5883a9c5b2591d8197ab","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42276/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42276/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/42276/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/791dc0007bf47648d75f63aaa3ef010b9192d04e","head":{"label":"anchovYu:lca-limitation-better-error","ref":"lca-limitation-better-error","sha":"791dc0007bf47648d75f63aaa3ef010b9192d04e","user":{"login":"anchovYu","id":25225043,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjI1MDQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25225043?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu","html_url":"https://github.com/anchovYu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":286528918,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODY1Mjg5MTg=","name":"spark","full_name":"anchovYu/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"anchovYu","id":25225043,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjI1MDQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25225043?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu","html_url":"https://github.com/anchovYu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anchovYu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/anchovYu/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFix double encryption issue for migrated shuffle blocks\r\n\r\nShuffle blocks upon migration are sent without decryption when io.encryption is enabled. The code on the receiving side ends up using serializer.wrapStream on the OutputStream to the file which results in the already encrypted bytes being encrypted again when the bytes are written out.\r\n\r\nThis patch removes the usage of serializerManager.wrapStream on the receiving side and also adds tests that validate that this works as expected. I have also validated that the added tests will fail if the fix is not in place.\r\n\r\nJira ticket with more details: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-44588\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nMigrated shuffle blocks will be double encrypted when `spark.io.encryption = true` without this fix.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests were added to test shuffle block migration with spark.io.encryption enabled and also fixes a test helper method to properly construct the SerializerManager with the encryption key.\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-01T22:05:58Z","updated_at":"2023-08-01T22:07:43Z","closed_at":"2023-08-01T22:06:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1405801475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/ML","name":"ML","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1405803268,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAzMjY4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/MLLIB","name":"MLLIB","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIf the ExecutePlan never reached the server, a ReattachExecute will fail with INVALID_HANDLE.OPERATION_NOT_FOUND. In that case, we could try to send ExecutePlan again.\r\n\r\nNote: This is an \"overkill\" version of the change.\r\nEven though we empirically observed that error is throws only from first next() or hasNext() of the response StreamObserver, wrap the initial call in retries as well to not depend on it in case it's just an quirk of GRPC that's not fully dependable.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis solves an edge case of reattachable execution where the initial execution never reached the server.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTesting these failures is difficult, will require some special testing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to match the type for `DatetimeIndex`/`TimedeltaIndex` with [pandas 2](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/whatsnew/v2.0.0.html).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo match the behavior with pandas 2 and above.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, the return type for several DatatimeIndex & TimedeltaIndex APIs is changed to `int32` instead of `int64`. e.g.\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n>>> s = ps.from_pandas(pd.date_range('2016-12-31', '2017-01-08', freq='D').to_series())\r\n>>> s.dt.dayofweek\r\n2016-12-31    5\r\n2017-01-01

If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nMethod `DataSourceStrategy#selectFilters`, which is used to determine \"pushdown-able\" filters, does not preserve the order of the input Seq[Expression] nor does it return the same order across the same plans. This is resulting in CodeGenerator cache misses even when the exact same LogicalPlan is executed. \r\n\r\nThis PR to make sure `selectFilters` returns predicates in deterministic order.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nMake sure `selectFilters` returns predicates in deterministic order, to reduce the probability of codegen cache misses.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nadd new test.\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1. Refactor `UnresolvedHint` to accept Expressions only as parameters\r\n2. ResolveHints now parses StringLiteral as UnresolvedAttribute, which would allow users to specify string in parameters directly\r\n3. `hint` method in Dataset now treats all its parameters as `Column`s or `Literal`s, all other values would be rejected. The method signature is kept for better compatibility and ease of use. It also matches how hint method is handled in the Connect module.\r\n4. Connect: PySpark Connect now accepts `Column` as hint's parameters.\r\n5. PySpark: allows `Column` as hint's parameters and tighten the input parameters type check: for list input, only list of primitive values is now allowed\r\n6. SparkR: allows `Column` as hint's parameters and corresponding test.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis is a rework of #37616. Before this commit, there's no way for users to directly specify hint info that include column info in PySpark's hint method. In other ways, `rebalance` hint that requires column refs is not possible before this PR.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. PySpark and Spark for R uses may specify rebalance and repartition hint with ease.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded UTs.","created_at":"2023-08-01T06:09:32Z","updated_at":"2023-08-22T04:59:17Z","closed_at":"2023-08-21T00:28:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b43e555fbaa5679e228398e95895e7bf9a125613","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1984361638,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTg0MzYxNjM4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/R","name":"R","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42255/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/42255/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/42255/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1383efa5e2de8e86114db8ba6c5c0c1cfb73b1e3","head":{"label":"advancedxy:SPARK-40178","ref":"SPARK-40178","sha":"1383efa5e2de8e86114db8ba6c5c0c1cfb73b1e3","user":{"login":"advancedxy","id":807537,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzUzNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/807537?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy","html_url":"https://github.com/advancedxy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18693947,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODY5Mzk0Nw==","name":"spark","full_name":"advancedxy/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"advancedxy","id":807537,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzUzNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/807537?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy","html_url":"https://github.com/advancedxy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/advancedxy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/advancedxy/spark","description":"Mirror
