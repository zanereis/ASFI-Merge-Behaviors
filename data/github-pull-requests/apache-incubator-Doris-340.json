Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #7823\r\n\r\nAfter the subquery is rewritten, the rewritten stmt needs to be reset\r\n(that is, the content of the first analyze semantic analysis is cleared),\r\nand then the rewritten stmt can be reAnalyzed.\r\n\r\nThe lateral view ref in the previous implementation forgot to implement the reset function.\r\nThis caused him to keep the first error message in the second analyze.\r\nEventually, two duplicate tupleIds appear in the new stmt and are marked with different tuple.\r\nFrom the explain string, the following syntax will have an additional wrong join predicate.\r\n```\r\nQuery: explain select k1 from test_explode lateral view explode_split(k2, \",\") tmp as e1  where k1 in (select k3 from tbl1);\r\nError equal join conjunct: `k3` = `k3`\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis pr mainly adds the reset function of the lateral view\r\nto avoid possible errors in the second analyze\r\nwhen the lateral view and subquery rewrite occur at the same time.\r\n","created_at":"2022-01-21T03:11:09Z","updated_at":"2022-01-30T11:18:09Z","closed_at":"2022-01-30T11:18:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"36ef5bc6fd01245d25d7849d439bc5d3886b40b4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":665965626,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2NjU5NjU2MjY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/kind/fix","name":"kind/fix","color":"e11d21","default":false,"description":"Categorizes

Proposed changes\r\n1. refactor BitmapRangeIterator, avoid new/delete, check _eof in loop while _read_next_batch to simply outloop's check\r\n2. modify evaluate_vec, avoid set and check new_flags out of block_column_predicate->evaluate_vec()\r\n3. replace _block_rowids.reserve() with _block_rowids.resize(). access vector's data with subscript is illegal after reverving, when via at() or operator[] access vector's data may assert failed, the behavior is depend on STL's implements \r\n4. optimize insert_default_value_res_column and insert_res_column by operating PODArray data directly\r\n5. using empty() interface instead of 'size() > 0', because empty() is fittable, sometimes faster, such as for container list, refer to Effective C++ \r\n6. some other small changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close

Some code from clickhouse\r\n\r\n**ClickHouse is an excellent implementation of the vectorized execution engine database, so here we have borrowed a lot from its excellent implementation in terms of data structure and function implementation. We are based on ClickHouse v19.16.2.2 and would like to thank the ClickHouse community and developers.**\r\n\r\nThe following comment has been added to the code from Clickhouse:\r\n// This file is copied from\r\n// https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/blob/master/src/Interpreters/AggregationCommon.h\r\n// and modified by Doris\r\n\r\n### 2. Support exec node and query:\r\n* vaggregation_node\r\n* vanalytic_eval_node\r\n* vassert_num_rows_node\r\n* vblocking_join_node\r\n* vcross_join_node\r\n* vempty_set_node\r\n* ves_http_scan_node\r\n* vexcept_node\r\n* vexchange_node\r\n* vintersect_node\r\n* vmysql_scan_node\r\n* vodbc_scan_node\r\n* volap_scan_node\r\n* vrepeat_node\r\n* vschema_scan_node\r\n* vselect_node\r\n* vset_operation_node\r\n* vsort_node\r\n* vunion_node\r\n* vhash_join_node\r\n\r\nYou can run exec engine of SSB/TPCH and 70% TPCDS stand query test set.\r\n\r\n### 3. Data Model\r\n\r\nVec Exec Engine Support **Dup/Agg/Unq** table, Support Block Reader Vectorized. Segment Vec is working in process.\r\n\r\n### 4. How to use\r\n\r\n1. Set the environment variable `set enable_vectorized_engine = true; `(required)\r\n2. Set the environment variable `set batch_size = 4096; ` (recommended)\r\n\r\n### 5. Some diff from origin exec engine\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/doris-vectorized/doris-vectorized/issues/294\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: (No)\r\n2. Has unit tests been added: (Yes)\r\n3. Has document been added or modified: (No)\r\n4. Does it need to update dependencies: (No)\r\n5. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back: (Yes)\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n","created_at":"2022-01-17T13:04:30Z","updated_at":"2023-11-13T06:18:23Z","closed_at":"2022-01-18T02:07:16Z","merged_at":"2022-01-18T02:07:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"e1d7233e9ca6addf4967c7df10a7c7c5728716d9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1099563192,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDk5NTYzMTky","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/kind/feature","name":"kind/feature","color":"c7def8","default":false,"description":"Categorizes

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #7755\r\n\r\n## Problem Summary:\r\n\r\nIf an load task has a relatively short timeout, then we need to ensure that\r\neach RPC of this task does not get blocked for a long time.\r\nAnd an RPC is usually blocked for two reasons.\r\n\r\n1. handling \"memory exceeds limit\" in the RPC\r\n    \r\n    If the system finds that the memory occupied by the load exceeds the threshold,\r\n    it will select the load channel that occupies the most memory and flush the memtable in it.\r\n    this operation is done in the RPC, which may be more time consuming.\r\n\r\n2. close the load channel\r\n\r\n    When the load channel receives the last batch, it will end the task.\r\n    It will wait for all memtables flushes to finish synchronously. This process is also time consuming.\r\n\r\nTherefore, this PR solves this problem by.\r\n\r\n1. Use timeout to determine whether it is a high-priority load task\r\n\r\n    If the timeout of an load task is relatively short, then we mark it as a high-priority task.\r\n\r\n2. not processing \"memory exceeds limit\" for high priority tasks\r\n3. use a separate flush thread to flush memtable for high priority tasks.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: (No)\r\n2. Has unit tests been added: (No Need)\r\n3. Has document been added or modified: (Yes)\r\n4. Does it need to update dependencies: (No)\r\n5. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back: (No)\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered,

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nPrepare to generate hermetic build using GCC 11 and Clang 13.

If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have created an issue on (Fix #ISSUE) and described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [X] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [X] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] If these changes need document changes, I have updated the document\r\n- [X] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nThe experience of compiling Doris can be improved in many ways (I failed to compile it several times over the last year). The non-intrusive way of doing it will be providing a dedicated toolchain to build both thirdparty deps and the backend. This PR contains such proposal along with some improvements for building the thirdparty on unclean environment (some environment provides system shared libs which should not be found and used).\r\n\r\nBenefits:\r\n\r\n1. Generate Byte-identical binaries. Good for quality control, testing, debugging, redistributing and forking.\r\n2. No docker dependency (your dev environment will appreciate that).\r\n3. Extremely friendly to new developers and potentially attracting more contributors\r\n4. Much easier to correctly maintain all build deps.\r\n\r\nWith the ldb toolchain, a minimal centos-7 dev machine (without web-ui things) will be the following:\r\n```\r\n    yum install -y \\\r\n        byacc \\\r\n        patch \\\r\n        automake \\\r\n        libtool \\\r\n        make \\\r\n        which \\\r\n        file \\\r\n        ncurses-devel \\\r\n        gettext-devel \\\r\n        bison \\\r\n        java-11-openjdk-devel \\\r\n        maven \\\r\n        unzip \\\r\n        bzip2 \\\r\n        zip\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhy centos 7? Because it's the still maintained linux distribution with oldest GLIBC (2.17). https://gist.github.com/wagenet/35adca1a032cec2999d47b6c40aa45b1\r\n\r\nIt's also possible to enrich the LDB toolchain so that no external dependency is required.\r\n\r\nIt's worth mentioning if LDB toolchain is used, env `ASAN_SYMBOLIZER_PATH` should be set to the path of llvm-symbolizer explicitly.\r\n\r\nWith alternative toolchains, we can catch undefined behaviors like https://github.com/apache/incubator-doris/blob/a034c20d169d65b500bd984240eacd5c89c68571/be/src/util/simd/vstring_function.h#L93-L112\r\n\r\nThe undefined behavior of `__builtin_ctz` is described here

Proposed changes\r\n\r\n1. Add a new FE config `colocate_group_relocate_delay_second`\r\n\r\n    The relocation of a colocation group may involve a large number of tablets moving within the cluster.\r\n    Therefore, we should use a more conservative strategy to avoid relocation of colocation groups as much as possible.\r\n    Relocation usually occurs after a BE node goes offline or goes down.\r\n    This config is used to delay the determination of BE node unavailability.\r\n    The default is 30 minutes, i.e., if a BE node recovers within 30 minutes, relocation of the colocation group\r\n    will not be triggered.\r\n\r\n2. Change the priority of colocate tablet repair and balance task from HIGH to NORMAL\r\n\r\n2. Add a new FE config allow_replica_on_same_host\r\n\r\n    If set to true, when creating table, Doris will allow to locate replicas of a tablet\r\n    on same host. And also the tablet repair and balance will be disabled.\r\n    This is only for local test, so that we can deploy multi BE on same host and create table\r\n    with multi replicas.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [ ] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n- [ ] Optimization. Including functional usability improvements and performance improvements.\r\n- [ ] Dependency. Such as changes related to third-party components.\r\n- [ ] Other.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have created an issue on (Fix #ISSUE) and described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] If these changes need document changes, I have updated the document\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at dev@doris.apache.org by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n","created_at":"2022-01-07T02:03:10Z","updated_at":"2022-01-18T02:26:37Z","closed_at":"2022-01-18T02:26:37Z","merged_at":"2022-01-18T02:26:37Z","merge_commit_sha":"3494c8973b91d725cff1c4c20e87bcb1e6f4f300","assignee":{"login":"yangzhg","id":9098473,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwOTg0NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9098473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg","html_url":"https://github.com/yangzhg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"yangzhg","id":9098473,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwOTg0NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9098473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg","html_url":"https://github.com/yangzhg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1998965480,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTk4OTY1NDgw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/area/colocated","name":"area/colocated","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":"Issues

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nCurrently, if we encounter a problem with a replica of a tablet during the load process,\r\nsuch as a write error, rpc error, -235, etc., it will cause the entire load job to
