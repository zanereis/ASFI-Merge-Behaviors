a 4-byte integer instead of a 2-byte short. When using uncompressed data, we know that the length of the DataFrame will be no more than 64 KB so a 2-byte short is sufficient. However, if data is compresed, there's a chance that the compressed form of the data will be larger than the uncompressed form (for example, with random binary data or with encrypted data). In this situation, we can end up overflowing the 2-byte short, which causes the length that is written to be wrong. Using a 4-byte integer avoids this situation.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\n_Enables X functionality; fixes bug NIFI-YYYY._\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-6703\r\nUsers should be able to easily run Stateless NiFi flows from the CLI without docker.\r\n\r\nAdded stateless bootstrap and nar to nifi-assembly and removed nifi-stateless/nifi-stateless-assembly. nifi-docker/dockermaven-stateless was updated to accommodate this change.\r\n\r\nAdded a new top level action (stateless) to nifi.sh which runs the \"org.apache.nifi.stateless.NiFiStateless\" bootstrap class with the provided arguments after extracting nars. Note that this is intentionally synchronous to allow for many stateless flows on the same machine.\r\n\r\nMoved nifi-stateless into nifi-framework to resolve jar conflicts between traditional and stateless runtimes.\r\n\r\nUpdated stateless-nifi/README.md\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ X ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [ X ] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [ X ] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `master`)?\r\n\r\n- [ X ] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ X ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ X ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on both JDK 8 and JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check travis-ci for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

Description of PR\r\n\r\nThe NiFi and NiFi Bootstrap processes both bind to random ephemeral\r\nports to allow for inter-process communication (e.g. shutdown, port,\r\nping, etc.). However, the randomness of these ephemeral ports can pose\r\nchallenges for some security policies (e.g. iptables, firewall).\r\n\r\nThis adds two configuration options, nifi.bootstrap.listen.port and\r\nnifi.commandcontrol.listen.port, that allow an administrator to define\r\nwhich ports the two processes should bind to for this communication,\r\nmaking it easier to define security policies. Options default to zero to\r\nmaintain the current ephemeral port behavior.\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nThere was an issue where the `Apply` button on the Edit Parameter dialog wouldn't be enabled if the parameter value entered matches the masked value that the server sends to the UI (`********`  - 8 asterisks). This PR fixes that as well as ensures that `Set Empty String` checkbox is reset on dialog close like the other input fields.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `master`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on both JDK 8 and JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check travis-ci for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nSeveral processor-related values that can be got by ProcessorStatus api are not still implemented in Prometheus Reporting Task. Also, JVM GC metrics are valuable and would be needed, it's worth adding them. This PR enriches them.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `master`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on both JDK 8 and JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nWhen using PrometheusReportingTask, metrics of removed/renamed components continues to remain after removing/renaming them completely in the NiFi UI. This is supposed to happen because PrometheusReportingTask adds an incremental difference into the Prometheus' collector. To deal with it, we could clear all collectors before returning the metrics. This PR fixes it.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `master`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [X] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on both JDK 8 and JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check travis-ci for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-6703\r\nUsers should be able to easily run Stateless NiFi flows from the CLI without docker.\r\n\r\nAdded stateless bootstrap and nar to nifi-assembly and removed nifi-stateless/nifi-stateless-assembly. nifi-docker/dockermaven-stateless was updated to accommodate this change.\r\n\r\nAdded a new top level action (stateless) to nifi.sh which runs the \"org.apache.nifi.stateless.NiFiStateless\" bootstrap class with the provided arguments after extracting nars. Note that this is intentionally synchronous to allow for many stateless flows on the same machine. \r\n\r\nUpdated stateless-nifi/README.md\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ X ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [ X ] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [ X ] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `master`)?\r\n\r\n- [ X ] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ X ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on both JDK 8 and JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ X ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check travis-ci for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as possible.\r\n","created_at":"2019-09-23T22:54:36Z","updated_at":"2019-10-01T03:42:43Z","closed_at":"2019-10-01T03:42:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"80c90c7f080644701e5ef1edf065739e100e44b8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/3762/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/3762/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3762/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/statuses/816ba42b5eb7260999fc6a0ee546a404e46cd74e","head":{"label":"SamHjelmfelt:statelesscli","ref":"statelesscli","sha":"816ba42b5eb7260999fc6a0ee546a404e46cd74e","user":{"login":"SamHjelmfelt","id":17031932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDMxOTMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17031932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamHjelmfelt","html_url":"https://github.com/SamHjelmfelt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamHjelmfelt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamHjelmfelt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamHjelmfelt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamHjelmfelt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamHjelmfelt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamHjelmfelt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamHjelmfelt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamHjelmfelt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamHjelmfelt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":161776511,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjE3NzY1MTE=","name":"nifi","full_name":"SamHjelmfelt/nifi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"SamHjelmfelt","id":17031932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDMxOTMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17031932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamHjelmfelt","html_url":"https://github.com/SamHjelmfelt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamHjelmfelt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamHjelmfelt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamHjelmfelt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamHjelmfelt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamHjelmfelt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamHjelmfelt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamHjelmfelt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamHjelmfelt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SamHjelmfelt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/SamHjelmfelt/nifi","description":"Mirror

Description of PR\r\n\r\n* Porting of MIN_IDLE, MAX_IDLE, EVICTION_RUN_PERIOD, MIN_EVICTABLE_IDLE_TIME properties from DBCPConnectionPool into Hive3ConnectionPool.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned to the Jira user @jamescheng, I wasn't able to bring all the additional features from DBCPConnectionPool to Hive3ConnectionPool because they rely on different commons-dbcp (that is, Hive3ConnectionPool uses an older implementation). \r\n\r\nFor this reason, since this is a minor update, I avoided MAX_CONN_LIFETIME and SOFT_MIN_EVICTABLE_IDLE_TIME, while however introducing MIN_IDLE,  MAX_IDLE, EVICTION_RUN_PERIOD and MIN_EVICTABLE_IDLE_TIME.\r\n\r\nI moreover found out a lack of UTs for Hive3ConnectionPool, for which I was thinking to fix using the same strategy I saw in other controller service tests (i.e. creating a fake processor with a single property which is the controller service to test and then applying tests on that processor to verify the controller service behavior). \r\ncc @mattyb149 and @patricker, since you worked on Hive3ConnectionPool and DBCPConnectionPool, could you please take a look on this PR? What do you think about working on adding a more comprehensive test suite? Thank you!\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nThis enables the option of sending out a Useragent header to all InvokeHTTP requests and also adds a sensible default value.\r\n\r\nSomething like this was present before in the (now deprecated) GetHTTP (but without the default value).\r\n\r\nThe default useragent value is based on a combination of the version of Nifi at hand, the java version and the operating system version.\r\n\r\nIn my local environment the end result was this default useragent:\r\n\r\n`Apache Nifi/1.10.0-SNAPSHOT (git:rel/nifi-1.9.0-347-gec3ea46; Java/1.8.0_222; Linux 4.4.0-159-generic; amd64; https://nifi.apache.org/)`\r\n\r\nTo make this possible I changed:\r\n1. The nifi-api now has a generated class that contains several build time variables (like project version, build time and git information).\r\n1. The VariableRegistry ENVIRONMENT_SYSTEM_REGISTRY includes these variables.\r\n1. The StandardProcessorTestRunner now loads the ENVIRONMENT_SYSTEM_REGISTRY variables by default to allow any testing on these variables.\r\n1. The InvokeHTTP now has a property with that holds the useragent value that uses the Expression language to make it dynamic. It is dynamic per flow file so people have the option of writing a flow that changes the useragent per flowfile going through.\r\n\r\nThis improvement fixes NIFI-6666.\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve?

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nProperties for Volatile Content Repository are introduced, but they don't appear in the default nifi.properties. It is convenient if we prepare these properties by default. This PR adds them.\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-6664\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `master`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on both JDK 8 and JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check travis-ci for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as possible.\r\n","created_at":"2019-09-13T09:11:48Z","updated_at":"2021-05-11T00:04:56Z","closed_at":"2021-05-11T00:04:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a459a477f2e91f4c749a1ea1fbf1582e71353428","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2915399856,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyOTE1Mzk5ODU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/3733/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/3733/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/3733/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/statuses/89db1a061827cea107a41dfba4a410fe2d310d13","head":{"label":"kotarot:NIFI-6664","ref":"NIFI-6664","sha":"89db1a061827cea107a41dfba4a410fe2d310d13","user":{"login":"kotarot","id":1787125,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODcxMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1787125?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kotarot","html_url":"https://github.com/kotarot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kotarot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kotarot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kotarot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kotarot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kotarot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kotarot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kotarot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kotarot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kotarot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":151353521,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTEzNTM1MjE=","name":"nifi","full_name":"kotarot/nifi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kotarot","id":1787125,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODcxMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1787125?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kotarot","html_url":"https://github.com/kotarot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kotarot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kotarot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kotarot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kotarot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kotarot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kotarot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kotarot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kotarot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kotarot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kotarot/nifi","description":"Mirror

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nAdds parameter contexts and parameters to the things that can be searched.\r\n\r\nParameter contexts match on name, id, and/or description. Selecting a Parameter context result opens the Parameter Context List dialog with the appropriate one selected in the table. Users must have READ access, otherwise that context (and parameters) will not be searched.\r\n\r\nParameters match on name, description, and value (for non-sensitive parameters). Selecting a Parameter result opens the parameter context dialog and selects the parameter in the table.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `master`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [X] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on both JDK 8 and JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check travis-ci for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as
