Airflow Maintainers,\n\nPlease accept this PR that addresses the following issues:\n- AIRFLOW-124\n\nThis PR forms the basis for the roadmap (https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_Y7S4YFVWvYM1o0aDhKMjJhNzg) . It is one of the initial commits from https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/compare/master...bolkedebruin:AIRFLOW_SCHEDULER .\n\n**DAG.create_dagrun (please review: @aoen, @jlowin, @mistercrunch, @artwr )**\n\nThis creates dagrun from a Dag. It also creates the TaskInstances from the tasks known at instantiation time. By having taskinstances created at dagrun instantiation time, deadlocks that were tested for will not take place anymore (@jlowin, correct? different test required?). For now, the visual consequence of having these taskinstances already there is that they will be black in the tree view.\n\nTests in core.py were adjusted as they were supposedly creating a dagrun with tasks, while they were actually creating dagruns and orphaned TaskInstances (ie. the dag_id was not matching the dag_id from the dagrun). This was discussed with @artwr, who said these were remnants from the past.\n\nBy doing this I also fixed an issue in models.py that a dag was not set for a task if called from dag.add_task (@aoen, @jlowin).\n\n**DagRun.find is a convenience function that returns the DagRuns for a given dag. It makes sure to have a single place how to find dagruns**\n\nDagRun.find does not work for all cases yet (ie multiple execution dates etc). My aim is to limit the ORM required in sub functions that implement somethings just a bit differently creating compatibility

Airflow Maintainers,\n\nPlease accept this PR that addresses the following issues:\n- _https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-106_\n\nA Picture speaks a 1000 words. \nThe first 4 DagRuns in the image below are before the fix, the last DagRun is with the fix.\n\nThe bug in the first 4 DagRuns is that the task is forever stuck in the UP_FOR_RETRY state although the DagRun has FAILED. As a consequence, failure callbacks, failure emails, and retries are not executed.\n\nThe 5th DagRun has the fix. In this case, all retries were executed. When the retries had been exhausted, full failure handing was executed: failure emails, failure callbacks, etc...\n\n<img width=\"783\" alt=\"screenshot 2016-05-12 03 42 37\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/581734/15203474/bea73828-17f3-11e6-8284-66a4e0b8c321.png\">\n\nThis shows that if the failed task is not the first in the DagRun, then the behavior is correct before and after my fix. As above, the first 4 DagRuns are with before my fix and the 5th is with my fix. \n\n<img width=\"786\" alt=\"screenshot 2016-05-12 16 34 25\"

moving to Apache, and the Highcharts license is not compatible with ours.\n\nThis rips out the dependency on Highcharts in favor of NVD3, and attempts to keep the charting application working where

IS A DRAFT WIP PULL REQUEST**\nThis is a draft for a solution to https://github.com/airbnb/airflow/issues/1383 among several other things.\nThere are tons of things broken/missing here, I'm just putting this out there to get some initial eyes on the high-level changes.\n\n**Goals**\n- Simplify, consolidate, and make consistent the logic of whether or not a task should be run\n- Provide a view that gives insight into why a task instance is not currently running (no more viewing the scheduler logs to find out why a task instance isn't running for the majority of cases)\n  e.g. (this will not be the final product):\n  ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1592778/14835487/daf435e4-0bbe-11e6-9650-844543bb82e7.png)\n\n**Things to review in this PR**\n- The high level idea of refactoring of all of the dependency checking for regular task execution, backfills, etc into one single function\n- Any of the functional changes (not the code itself) made listed in \"Some big changes made in this PR\"\n- The design of the BaseTIDep class\n- Any changes in design that would require a complete rewrite of the current changes (where it would be non-trivial to change the code in the PRs diff to conform with the new design)\n\n**Things NOT to review in this PR**\n- The view layer for surfacing the failing dependencies to users\n- Bugs/debugging statements that should be removed/lack of tests/lack of comments/etc.\n- Failing CI/merge conflicts, due to the somewhat large scope of this change I will iterate on a fixed SHA on master and then either rebase all at once or break the PR up into smaller parts and release them individually\n- Performance/DB hits (Max had some valid concerns and I will test for this and optimize/cache as appropriate)\n\n**Some big changes made in this PR**\n- Paused DAG checking now occurs at the task instance level in models.py instead of in jobs.py to consolidate the \"should this task run\" logic into one place\n- Pool behavior in backfills is now consistent with how regular tasks are pooled (pools are always respected in backfills).\n  This will break one use case:\n  Using pools to restrict some resource on airflow executors themselves (rather than an external resource like a DB), e.g. some task uses 60% of cpu on a worker so we restrict that task's pool size to 1 to prevent two of the tasks from running on the same host. When backfilling a task of this type, now the backfill will wait on the pool to have slots open up before running the task even though we don't need to do this if backfilling on a different host outside of the pool. I think breaking this use case is OK since the use case is a hack due to not having a proper resource isolation solution (e.g. mesos should be used in this case instead).\n- To make things less confusing for users, force running a task will now override/ignore:\n  - task instance's pool being full\n  - execution date for a task instance being in the future\n  - a task instance being in the retry waiting period\n  - the task instance's task ending prior to the task instance's execution date\n  - task instance is already queued\n  - task instance has already succeeded\n  - task instance is in the shutdown state\n  - WILL NOT OVERRIDE task instance is already running\n- SLA miss emails will now include all tasks that did not finish for a particular DAG run, even if the tasks didn't run because depends_on_past was not met for a task\n- Failed tasks will no longer be considered \"runnable\", they must be force-run or cleared first from the UI to be run, just like successful tasks\n\nI can revert these changes in behavior but it will make the code messier and I think it's a huge win to be consistent (both for code simplicity and for intuitiveness for users) across the board as much as possible when the question \"should this task be run right now?\" is asked.\n\n**Future Work (will not be released in the first version)**\n- Show one more dagrun in the tree view (even when that dagrun's execution date hasn't occured yet) so that users can see why task instances in the next dagrun are blocked. I wanted to include this in the first release but it's non-trivial to do (one way to solve this is to generate DAG runs before their execution date occurs).\n- Break down failed dependency explanations better (e.g. if the trigger rules requiring all upstream task successes fails, indicate the specific upstream tasks that failed)\n- Make failing dependencies for task instances more visible to users (e.g. asyncrhonously display failing dependencies when mousing over a task instance in the tree view).\n- Parallelize task instance dependency checking.\n- Indicate that a task isn't running because it was manually cleared: if a task is manually cleared the scheduler won't automatically rerun it, but there is no way of knowing this for sure without some kind of flag that marks the task state as cleared.\n- Can potentially add tips to fix a failing dependency in the new view that shows failed task instance dependencies (e.g. for \"depends_on_past\" when the last task state is failing we can give the tip to get this task to succeed, or even provide a button to clear it right from that view)\n- Additional task instance dependencies, e.g. there are no schedulers running (a task can't get scheduled until a scheduler is running), or the airflow scheduler queue is backed up\n- Forcing tasks in the UI should give users feedback on why their task didn't get forced (e.g. task was already running)\n- Keep history of changes to blocked dependencies that are accessible via the UI (this is useful to know why a task's execution was delayed)\n\n@mistercrunch @jlowin @plypaul

particular issue arises because of an alignment issue between\nstart_date and schedule_interval. This can only happen with cron-based\nschedule_intervals that describe absolute points in time (like “1am”) as\nopposed to time deltas (like “every hour”)\n\nIn the past (and in the docs) we have simply said that users must make\nsure the two params agree. But this is counter intuitive. As in these\ncases, start_date is sort of like telling the scheduler to\n“start paying attention” as opposed to “this is my first execution date”.\n\nThis patch changes the behavior of the scheduler. The next run date of\nthe dag will be treated as \"start_date + interval\" unless the start_date\nis on the (previous) interval in which case the start_date will be the\nnext run date.\n- Supersedes

Airflow Maintainers,\n\nPlease accept the following PR:\n\n_Context_\nCurrently, when **marking the success status** of an operator via the UI, there is no way to **recursively include all operators that are nested within a SubDagOperator**\n\n_Solution_\nThis PR adds a UI toggle \"Recursive\" (on the same level as Past/Future/Downstream/Upstream) to recursively set the success status of all operators within a SubDagOperator\n\n![screen shot 2016-04-28 at 12 56 01

Airflow Maintainers,\n\nPlease forgive the sudden PR, but I felt like it would be easier to describe what i want to do if there was some (pseudo) code to look at to understand the idea.\n\nI'd like to add a \"continuous\" scheduling option.  A \"continuous\" schedule is one that will run the DAG unless there is already an instance of the DAG running.  This is primarily useful for DAGs that are started by sensors written under the assumption that you either want the sensor to be active and checking for data or you want the DAG to be running.\n\nI.e. if you have a sensor that watches something like HCat for partition changes, you'd really like to know that either there is a partition change that is being processed or that there is nothing to be processed but you are actively looking and waiting for something to show up.\n\nI haven't run the attached code yet so there's likely some issue with it, but I believe that it expresses what I think is required.  Namely, we add the `\"@continuous\"` scheduling option as well as a new parameter `max_consecutive_failures` parameter on the DAG.  \n\n`max_consecutive_failures` exists as a protection to an error in the DAG causing infinite restarts of the DAG.  It is a property that only applies to the continuous case (or it could be promoted to apply in any scheduled case as well, if people were interested in that, but I'm intending to keep this proposal self-contained and not affect other things).\n\nThe primary downside I see to this implementation is that the DAG `execution_date` is always equal to `start_date` and is \"non-deterministic\".  I.e. it will be difficult to use the time selector in the DAG view on the UI to view a specific run of the DAG.  You can still track things down through the DAG history views and it could be possible to eventually adjust the UI to jump to like \"next\" and \"previous\" runs if this is a significant concern.  For us right now, this is not a significant concern.  Also, given that it only muddies the waters when you choose to use the continuous scheduling, it should only impact people who use this feature.\n\nIs this something that could get accepted into airflow or is this an abomination that you would never be willing to accept?  If it is something that people would be willing to accept, I can work on making it actually work and have tests and all that good stuff.\n","created_at":"2016-04-22T23:49:34Z","updated_at":"2016-11-21T00:07:17Z","closed_at":"2016-11-21T00:07:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cd1140281305f1f5681ed98f04c968820ee90ac7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1425/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1425/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1425/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/ef8b5cffa50377e4c54e8d04fcf318803b144a4f","head":{"label":"cheddar:continuous-scheduling","ref":"continuous-scheduling","sha":"ef8b5cffa50377e4c54e8d04fcf318803b144a4f","user":{"login":"cheddar","id":216778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNjc3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/216778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar","html_url":"https://github.com/cheddar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":56883371,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1Njg4MzM3MQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"cheddar/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cheddar","id":216778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNjc3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/216778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar","html_url":"https://github.com/cheddar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cheddar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cheddar/airflow","description":"Airflow

does, show a plus sign where the user can click to toggle the detail view.\n\nThis PR is related to the corresponding [roadmap item](https://github.com/airbnb/airflow/wiki/Roadmap#ui), I'd like to continue working on the edit form component if necessary. \n\nThe same goes to DagRun `conf` property, do you feel it's good to expose that as well? We internally have implemented that column in the DAG run view, it's quite helpful.\n\nReminder to contributors:\n- You must add an Apache License header to all new files\n- Please squash your commits

before doing execv. This makes it difficult\nfor some manager daemons (like supervisord) to send kill signals.\nThis patch uses os.execve directly. os.execve takes over the current\nprocess and thus responds correctly to signals\n\nIt also reverts detaching from the console by default.

running Airflow into a non development environment, I have found out that it could be a good idea to not initialize the metadata DB with the default connections that are added when you run `airflow initdb`.\n\nWith this PR, the DB is initialized without the connection examples and they are only added if you explicit it in the CLI as follows: `airflow initdb -l` or `airflow initdb --load-examples`. The same applies when running resetdb: `airflow resetdb -l` or `airflow resetdb --load-examples`.\n\nIf this functionality is covered with some features that I haven't heard of so far, please, forgive me, I am still quite new using the platform. If not, and you consider that it could be useful for other people, I'd be glad to see it merged.\n\nThanks in advance!\n","created_at":"2016-04-16T15:47:47Z","updated_at":"2016-10-22T09:58:44Z","closed_at":"2016-10-22T09:58:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"340fd7cee5735e9085592684bc0b40e7f23cbdd1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1392/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1392/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1392/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/4c5d2b9c0e79de8a94f1280c417c958e9233f5ba","head":{"label":"sdiazb:feature/initdb_without_examples","ref":"feature/initdb_without_examples","sha":"4c5d2b9c0e79de8a94f1280c417c958e9233f5ba","user":{"login":"sdiazb","id":2188742,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxODg3NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2188742?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdiazb","html_url":"https://github.com/sdiazb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdiazb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdiazb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdiazb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdiazb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdiazb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdiazb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdiazb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdiazb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdiazb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":56379863,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NjM3OTg2Mw==","name":"airflow","full_name":"sdiazb/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sdiazb","id":2188742,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxODg3NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2188742?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdiazb","html_url":"https://github.com/sdiazb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdiazb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdiazb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdiazb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdiazb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdiazb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdiazb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdiazb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdiazb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdiazb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sdiazb/airflow","description":"Airflow

PR aims as a start to apify the access to common functionality\n\nCurrently there is code and functionality duplication between for example the webserver and cli. In addition there are some concerns \n1. Many airflow 'services' (including the CLI) directly access the database.\n2. Duplication of functionality and code raising concerns about future maintainability (ie. in the webserver and the cli)\n3. Cluttering due to slightly different implementations\n\nTherefore this PR should track the initial implementation of an api that allows access to common functionality. The aim is to still allow direct access to the database for backward compatibility but also allow the use of a rest api.\n\nI took the recently added functionality of being able set and get variable from the cli as an example and initial starting point\n","created_at":"2016-04-16T13:19:37Z","updated_at":"2016-11-02T07:10:24Z","closed_at":"2016-11-02T07:10:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f3004fc48e2a12d1d2013c583ea4f44ee6558b44","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1391/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1391/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1391/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/c3072e67eba1885b95d989e847f36ba32589bbbc","head":{"label":"bolkedebruin:api_v2","ref":"api_v2","sha":"c3072e67eba1885b95d989e847f36ba32589bbbc","user":{"login":"bolkedebruin","id":4282712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4282712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin","html_url":"https://github.com/bolkedebruin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":38505714,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODUwNTcxNA==","name":"airflow","full_name":"bolkedebruin/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bolkedebruin","id":4282712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4282712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin","html_url":"https://github.com/bolkedebruin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bolkedebruin/airflow","description":"AirFlow

exist.\n\nThanks!\n","created_at":"2016-04-14T08:40:17Z","updated_at":"2016-10-26T18:26:33Z","closed_at":"2016-10-26T18:26:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ac67701757a14ef6bcf64d9af07e70ea187accec","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1379/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1379/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1379/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/6067cd18ccb3af11162a877a38535d31d0ae74ba","head":{"label":"yuanfeiz:descriptive-celery-executor-err-message","ref":"descriptive-celery-executor-err-message","sha":"6067cd18ccb3af11162a877a38535d31d0ae74ba","user":{"login":"yuanfeiz","id":705367,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNTM2Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/705367?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuanfeiz","html_url":"https://github.com/yuanfeiz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuanfeiz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuanfeiz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuanfeiz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuanfeiz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuanfeiz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuanfeiz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuanfeiz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuanfeiz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuanfeiz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"975b90ec3ce6410a0b578b7d031dc3d92874bcb2","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":33884891,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzg4NDg5MQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"apache/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow","description":"Apache

have been observing strange behavior from the Airflow scheduler lately. The behavior manifests itself as having a lot of active DAG runs with very few task instances being executed. Then, every two minutes, or so, a bunch of task instances would get scheduled. They'd then finish up pretty quickly (< 30s), and there would be no activity for 1m30s until more tasks were added.\n\nUpon investigation, it appears that the Airflow scheduler was taking more than 2 minutes to complete a single loop. We put in profiling in the jobs.py _execute method, and it became apparent that this loop was the culprit:\n\n```\n            for dag in dags:\n                self.logger.debug(\"Scheduling {}\".format(dag.dag_id))\n                dag = dagbag.get_dag(dag.dag_id)\n                if not dag or (dag.dag_id in paused_dag_ids):\n                    continue\n                try:\n                    self.schedule_dag(dag)\n                    self.process_dag(dag, executor)\n                    self.manage_slas(dag)\n                except Exception as e:\n                    self.logger.exception(e)\n```\n\nThe dagbag.get_dag(dag.dag_id) invocation was taking about 500ms per-DAG. I have 270 DAGs. 270 \\* .5 = ~2 minutes.\n\nThe get_dag method has an if-statement to determine if the DAG should be refreshed. Every DAG was getting refreshed on every iteration. This was happening because orm_dag.last_expired is None for all DAGs, which resulted in a check of `dag.last_loaded < datetime(2100, 1, 1)`, which it always is.\n\nThe fix appears to only check if last_expired is not None. If it's None, the UI hasn't been clicked, and we shouldn't bother checking if it needs to be refreshed (unless it's not in self.dags).\n\nThis dropped the scheduler loop from ~2 minutes to 16 seconds. This is still not great, but it's better. Now, each iteration of the for loop takes .05s. Still, .05_270 = 13.5 seconds. Ideally, I'd like this loop to be even lower. 270 DAGs aren't *that_ many.\n\nI think the scheduler's loop might need to be re-thought a bit, but I'll leave that for a different issue.\n","created_at":"2016-04-13T20:33:50Z","updated_at":"2016-05-04T19:40:49Z","closed_at":"2016-04-14T06:55:55Z","merged_at":"2016-04-14T06:55:55Z","merge_commit_sha":"e29bc34b1c1ea65f93d3723c7fd7d72cc99c41ba","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1374/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1374/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1374/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/fbd4c2b2bd2f870a2d07f05b45f61086dcd0823a","head":{"label":"criccomini:dont-reload-dags-on-every-scheduler-iteration","ref":"dont-reload-dags-on-every-scheduler-iteration","sha":"fbd4c2b2bd2f870a2d07f05b45f61086dcd0823a","user":{"login":"criccomini","id":167569,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NzU2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/167569?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini","html_url":"https://github.com/criccomini","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criccomini/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"5d15d6849ab8de5b835330a1ffced0690ee1a867","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":33884891,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzg4NDg5MQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"apache/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow","description":"Apache Airflow -
