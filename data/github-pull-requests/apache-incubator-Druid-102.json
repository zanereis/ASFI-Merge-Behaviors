is a less intrusive version of PR https://github.com/druid-io/druid/pull/3351, fixing issue https://github.com/druid-io/druid/issues/3346\n\nThe problem is that if the thread that executes `ZookeeperConsumerConnector.shutdown()` is interrupted, then the shutdown may fail to actually terminate the `ConsumerFetcherThread`s.\n\nTo avoid this, the following changes were made:\n1. When cancelling the futures, set `mayInterruptIfRunning` to `false`\n2. Make sure to always softly `shutdown()` the executor (instead of aggressively doing `shutdownNow()`).\n\nAlso, redundant checks like `!future.cancel() && !future.isDone()` were removed, since the javadoc of `cancel()` says that:\n\n> `After this method returns, subsequent calls to {@link #isDone} will always return {@code true}`\n\n(regardless of what `cancel` returns)\n","created_at":"2016-08-28T11:59:53Z","updated_at":"2018-07-06T15:36:30Z","closed_at":"2016-09-15T00:44:27Z","merged_at":"2016-09-15T00:44:27Z","merge_commit_sha":"d981a2aa02aedfdf18e0bed5848e704bd9597563","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/20","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/milestone/20","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/20/labels","id":1571409,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMTU3MTQwOQ==","number":20,"title":"0.9.2","description":"","creator":{"login":"fjy","id":428325,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODMyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/428325?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy","html_url":"https://github.com/fjy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":248,"state":"closed","created_at":"2016-02-08T22:01:21Z","updated_at":"2017-05-16T22:41:57Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2017-04-07T07:16:56Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/3403/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/3403/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/3403/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/statuses/72e3701ac3715eb62705c3c978fb561a3a74bbb6","head":{"label":"Plumbr:kafka-lookups-graceful-shutdown","ref":"kafka-lookups-graceful-shutdown","sha":"72e3701ac3715eb62705c3c978fb561a3a74bbb6","user":{"login":"Plumbr","id":4598624,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ1OTg2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4598624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Plumbr","html_url":"https://github.com/Plumbr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Plumbr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Plumbr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Plumbr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Plumbr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Plumbr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Plumbr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Plumbr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Plumbr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Plumbr/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":66762144,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2Njc2MjE0NA==","name":"druid","full_name":"Plumbr/druid","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Plumbr","id":4598624,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ1OTg2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4598624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Plumbr","html_url":"https://github.com/Plumbr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Plumbr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Plumbr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Plumbr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Plumbr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Plumbr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Plumbr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Plumbr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Plumbr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Plumbr/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Plumbr/druid","description":"Column

is a tool called [`insert-segment-to-db`](http://druid.io/docs/latest/operations/insert-segment-to-db.html) which produces metadata from actual files(descriptor.json, index.zip) stored in various storages. It's cool to use when I migrate segments from one to another or when I totally lose metadata at all and recover it from the scratch.\nHowever, I've found out that `insert-segment-to-db` does not support AWS S3 while I tried to regenerate metadata. That's why I made `S3DataSegmentFinder` to support finding segments in S3. There are some considerations I took as the below.\n1. `S3DataSegmentPushConfig` is reused here as other classes in `druid-s3-extensions` in place of introducing another configuration object.\n2. Since it is hard to write test codes to verify interations with S3, `MockStorageService` is introduced to mock `RestS3Service` up refering to `S3DataSegmentMoverTest`.\n\nThank you.\n","created_at":"2016-08-26T05:19:35Z","updated_at":"2018-07-06T15:36:30Z","closed_at":"2016-10-11T00:27:09Z","merged_at":"2016-10-11T00:27:09Z","merge_commit_sha":"6f21778364934a84f88e0ecac7a0f1ec088885bd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287687,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Feature","name":"Feature","color":"2ceefb","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/21","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/milestone/21","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/21/labels","id":1831000,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMTgzMTAwMA==","number":21,"title":"0.10.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"fjy","id":428325,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODMyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/428325?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy","html_url":"https://github.com/fjy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":310,"state":"closed","created_at":"2016-06-15T22:35:58Z","updated_at":"2017-06-06T17:41:02Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2017-05-16T22:41:20Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/3399/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/3399/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/3399/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/statuses/fce9c043e16cecfb926bef0dfb0a167e7bac91ff","head":{"label":"jaehc:feature-s3-segment-finder","ref":"feature-s3-segment-finder","sha":"fce9c043e16cecfb926bef0dfb0a167e7bac91ff","user":{"login":"jaehc","id":7674735,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NzQ3MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7674735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaehc","html_url":"https://github.com/jaehc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaehc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaehc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaehc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaehc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaehc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaehc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaehc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaehc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaehc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"67920c114e56b87ab911ed90280639fc40d63184","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":6358188,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MzU4MTg4","name":"druid","full_name":"apache/druid","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apac

OutputName is renamed according to new DimensionSpec.\n\nCurrently, however, it does not work for select and search queries.\nIt returns previous outputName stored in cached result.\n\nThis patch enables renaming of outputName in cached result for select and search queries.\n","created_at":"2016-08-24T09:17:12Z","updated_at":"2018-07-06T15:36:30Z","closed_at":"2016-09-20T15:19:14Z","merged_at":"2016-09-20T15:19:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"54ec4dd5846cdb35f3faa4898b6b7df033f3e60e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/20","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/milestone/20","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/20/labels","id":1571409,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMTU3MTQwOQ==","number":20,"title":"0.9.2","description":"","creator":{"login":"fjy","id":428325,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODMyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/428325?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy","html_url":"https://github.com/fjy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":248,"state":"closed","created_at":"2016-02-08T22:01:21Z","updated_at":"2017-05-16T22:41:57Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2017-04-07T07:16:56Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/3395/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/3395/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/3395/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/statuses/2070d5d9dbaf7b90de3ae45210fad87609257206","head":{"label":"sirpkt:cache-rename-output","ref":"cache-rename-output","sha":"2070d5d9dbaf7b90de3ae45210fad87609257206","user":{"login":"sirpkt","id":4968993,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Njg5OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4968993?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirpkt","html_url":"https://github.com/sirpkt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirpkt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirpkt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirpkt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirpkt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirpkt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirpkt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirpkt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirpkt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirpkt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":45589174,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NTU4OTE3NA==","name":"druid","full_name":"sirpkt/druid","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sirpkt","id":4968993,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Njg5OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4968993?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirpkt","html_url":"https://github.com/sirpkt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirpkt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirpkt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirpkt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirpkt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirpkt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirpkt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirpkt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirpkt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sirpkt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sirpkt/druid","description":"Column

holds count and sum (and nvariance). We can use of it.\n\nThis PR introduces `getInputTypeName()` in `AggregatorFactory` to acquire proper extractor for custom format. For example, basically variance can be calculated from serial numeric values from column. But in some case, we should accept pre-calculated variance something like `{\"sum\":x, \"count\":y, \"nvar\":z}` or `x:y:z`. This possibly can be done by using custom parser but it's redundant and not re-useable. If we can tip the type by specifying it in inputTypeName (`json-var` or 'num-var' for example), we can safely parse that to make variance holder in extractor.

directory behind\n\n```\n/global-work-dir/dataSource/version\n```\n\nthis patch changes the intermediate path to\n\n```\n/global-work-dir/dataSource/version_uuid\n```\n\nso that only 1 directory is created and then deleted appropriately which was also the behavior before

patch provides the integration of Druid & [Netflix Exhibitor](https://github.com/Netflix/exhibitor/wiki).\n\nExhibitor is a supervisor system for ZooKeeper.

#3346 required introducing more strict state management. However, while I was there, I felt obliged to do some refactoring to increase maintainability.\n\nI have reached a point where advancing further would be a bad idea before discussing it with original author(s) and other project collaborators. The main goals of this PR are:\n- Untangle the lifecycle management and make it explicit\n- Encapsulate the internal state of the class and stop directly mutating and checking it from within tests\n- Split up large methods with loads of nested blocks into small manageable methods\n\nMore detailed comments on specific changes are made inline, see the diff.\n\nPlease bash this PR as hard as you can :) I must have violated quite some conventions.\n\n**UPD: It might be much more convenient to view the changes as a split view instead of the unified

response json instead of HTTP header (\"X-Druid-Response-Context\")\n\nthis is primarily required to handle concerns regarding limits to the size of HTTP headers [in jetty and other places]. Currently we have a hack in place to always truncate context ( https://github.com/druid-io/druid/issues/2331 ) which makes responseContext somewhat unusable on the client side.\n\nso, to ensure backward compatibility, this PR introduces a new query endpoint \"/druid/v3\" that has following response format...\n\n{\n  \"result\": [ result1, result2,..... ],\n  \"context\": { \"k1\": &lt; value &gt; , .... }\n}\n\nNote that backward compatibility can also be achieved by utilizing a new value for HTTP \"Accept\" header instead of a new endpoint. But, chose new endpoint for \"simplicity\" (or at least thought it was simpler). I am willing to switch to that if others believe that is better than a new

streaming version of select.\r\nThe query is similar to select query\r\n\r\n``` json\r\n{\r\n    \"queryType\": \"scan\",\r\n    \"columns\": [\r\n        \"q_sales\",\"pv\"\r\n    ],\r\n    \"dataSource\": \"dws_tb_log_wl_100w_shard5\",\r\n    \"limit\": 10,\r\n    \"filter\": {\r\n        \"dimension\": \"q_sales\",\r\n        \"value\": \"55\",\r\n        \"type\": \"selector\"\r\n

the beginning to the end\r\n2. select query returns 1 Object who contains a event list which is huge, like {[a,b,c,d,e,f,...]}, scan query returns list of small batch of events, like [ [a,b,c], [d,e,f], [...] ]\r\n3. select query cost lots of memory because it has to buffer a huge list of events in memory, and flushes until the list is ready. scan query flushes when a small batch is ready,

an issue in production or not (it depends on whether\nsomething doing merging would `run` a QueryRunner but then not use the Sequence).\nIt did cause issues in the unit tests though, and fixing it

reverts commit a931debf790eaf4454ae13f35e11ba9d39765645.\nFixes #3283\n\nThe core issue here is that realtime nodes announce their size as 0, so a coordinator which interns the realtime version of the data segment will not be able to see the new sized announcement when handoff occurs.\n\nThis is caused by the `eauals` method on a `DataSegment` only evaluating the identifier. the `eauals` method _should_ be correct for object equivalence, and things which need to check equivalence of some sub-portion of the object should do so explicitly.\n","created_at":"2016-07-26T17:36:46Z","updated_at":"2018-07-06T15:36:24Z","closed_at":"2016-07-26T18:47:34Z","merged_at":"2016-07-26T18:47:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"188a4bc89aa0fc19887546dd6de9c813d4ae45a2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/20","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/milestone/20","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/20/labels","id":1571409,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMTU3MTQwOQ==","number":20,"title":"0.9.2","description":"","creator":{"login":"fjy","id":428325,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODMyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/428325?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy","html_url":"https://github.com/fjy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fjy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":248,"state":"closed","created_at":"2016-02-08T22:01:21Z","updated_at":"2017-05-16T22:41:57Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2017-04-07T07:16:56Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/3286/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/3286/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/3286/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/statuses/38e57151aa9d61d223be8f0f14caf5ce3cb99343","head":{"label":"metamx:revert3238","ref":"revert3238","sha":"38e57151aa9d61d223be8f0f14caf5ce3cb99343","user":{"login":"metamx","id":299329,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjI5OTMyOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/299329?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx","html_url":"https://github.com/metamx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":28248872,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODI0ODg3Mg==","name":"druid","full_name":"metamx/druid","private":false,"owner":{"login":"metamx","id":299329,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjI5OTMyOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/299329?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx","html_url":"https://github.com/metamx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/metamx/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/metamx/druid","description":"Real²time

PR adds a pure numeric StringComparator (supports decimals, negative numbers), used by the BoundFilter and GroupBy/TopN/Search queries.\n\nThe comparator will attempt to parse and compare Strings as BigDecimals.\n\nUnparseable strings are treated as nulls, and nulls precede numbers. When comparing two strings that cannot be parsed as numbers, the comparator will order them lexicographically.\n\nThe BoundDimFilter interface has also been changed, deprecating \"alphanumeric\" in favor of an \"ordering\" String field.\n\nThe PR also unifies the existing lexicographic and alphanumeric TopNMetricSpecs (i.e., the ones that sort on dimension values) into a DimensionTopNMetricSpec, which can accept any of the 4 string comparators currently supported.\n\nA similar unifying change is made for the SearchSortSpec (implemented in NewSearchSortSpec).\n\nFixes https://github.com/druid-io/druid/issues/2989\n# \n\nThe following benchmarks show the performance difference between using this numeric comparator and the existing alphanumeric comparator on a long column (__time).\n\nThe `basic` data set spans an interval from (0,1000000) milliseconds.\n\n`timeFilter` runs a timeseries query on the entire interval, using a filtered aggregator long sum with a BoundFilter for the __time interval (200000, 300000). The BoundFilter has an optimization that compares using long primitives if possible, when using the numeric comparator.\n\n`timeFilterAlphanumeric` is the same as the previous query, but using the existing alphanumeric comparator instead.\n\n`timeFilterByInterval` is a timeseries query on the interval (200000, 300000) with a long sum. This query is meant to provide a baseline comparison (interval based filtering vs. boundfilter on __time column). The interval based filtering is faster since the IncrementalIndex/QueryableIndex have optimizations that allow exclusion of rows using the interval (the boundfilter applied to the whole interval still has to read all of the rows)\n\n```\nTimeseriesBenchmark.queryMultiQueryableIndex                       1            750000              basic.timeFilter  avgt   50    19433.259 ±    66.505

PR changes the way v2 groupBy strategy process outer query using the result of inner query as datasource, addressing #3246. \n\nv1 groupBy strategy will use the same approach as before, by building an IncrementalIndex of inner query result, then use the query engine to process each interval on the built inner IncrementalIndex, and build an outer IncrementalIndex to merge the results.\n\nv2 groupBy strategy will process the inner query results directly using a combined approach of process and merge with the v2 Grouper.\n\nThis change also fixes #3239 for v2 since

changing the logic less error prone; otherwise there is a lot of similar but\nslightly different code in the two files.\n\nAlso fixes inconsistent metric handling between the two implementations. Formerly,\nRealtimePlumber only emitted query/segmentAndCache/time and query/wait, while\nAppenderator only emitted query/partial/time and query/wait (all per sink).\n\nNow they both do the same thing:\n- query/segmentAndCache/time, query/segment/time are the time spent per sink.\n- query/cpu/time is the CPU time spent per query. [new for both of them]\n- query/wait/time is the executor waiting time per sink. [no change to either]\n\nThese generally match historical metrics, except segmentAndCache & segment\nmean the same thing here, because one Sink may be partially cached and\npartially uncached and we
