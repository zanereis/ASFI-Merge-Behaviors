What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR adds new versions of `SparkSession.createDataset` and `SparkSession.createDataFrame` that take an `Array[Byte]` as input. The older versions that take a `protobuf.Any` are deprecated. This PR also adds new versions of `SparkConnectPlanner.transformRelation` and `SparkConnectPlanner.transformExpression` that take an `Array[Byte]`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nWithout these changes it's difficult to create plugins for Spark Connect. The methods above used to take a protobuf class that is shaded as input, meaning that that plugins had to shade these classes in the exact same way. Now they can just serialize the protobuf object to bytes and pass that in instead.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nTests were added\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a follow-up of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/45797 . Instead of detecting query execution errors and not wrapping them, it's better to do the error wrapping only in the data writer, which has more context. We can provide the specific file path when the error happened, instead of the destination directory name.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFollow up to https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/40447.\r\nAllows to configure the currently hardcoded max message of 128MB on the client side for both the Scala and Python clients.\r\nAdds the option to the Scala client and improves the way we handle `channelOptions` in Python's `ChannelBuiler`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nUsability - I am aware of two different cases where these limits are hit:\r\n\r\n1. The user is trying to create a large dataframe from local data. We either hit the` grpc.max_send_message_length` in the Python client ([currently hardcoded](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/40447/files)) or the `maxInboundMessageSize`  on the cluster side ([now configurable](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/40447/files)).\r\n2. The result from the cluster has a single row that is larger than 128MB, causing an `ExecutePlanResponse` that is larger than the client's `grpc.max_receive_message_length` (Python) or `channel.maxInboundMessageSize`  (Scala) ([both hardcoded](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/40447/files)).\r\n\r\nThis gives the option to increase these limits on the client side.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nScala: Adds option to set `grpcMaxMessageSize` to `SparkConnectClient.Builder`\r\nPython: No.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTests added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-04-03T09:15:25Z","updated_at":"2024-04-15T18:53:05Z","closed_at":"2024-04-15T18:53:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"423ba9a7a787be24fd4a5c8064bb14a0b855ed02","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45842/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45842/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/45842/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b580a99255e03744d2a431f79c8395093e78847d","head":{"label":"dillitz:SPARK-47694","ref":"SPARK-47694","sha":"b580a99255e03744d2a431f79c8395093e78847d","user":{"login":"dillitz","id":135709731,"node_id":"U_kgDOCBbEIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/135709731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz","html_url":"https://github.com/dillitz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":661600404,"node_id":"R_kgDOJ284lA","name":"spark","full_name":"dillitz/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dillitz","id":135709731,"node_id":"U_kgDOCBbEIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/135709731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz","html_url":"https://github.com/dillitz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dillitz/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently if there's any gRPC exception, instead of just handling it, the PySpark's gRPC error handler is going to print it out to the stderr, not allowing the user to cleanly ignore the exception by using try/except control flow statement.\r\n\r\nIn this PR we are removing the logger.exception call and we rely on the downstream exception mechanism to report this to the user.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWithout this change, there's no way that the user ignores the gRPC error without piping the stderr to /dev/null or equivalent.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, the stderr will not have the exception trace written twice.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nExisting tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

To be precise, SPARK-47704 missed this corner case because I could not find a small stable repro for the problem at the time.\r\n\r\nWhen `spark.sql.json.enablePartialResults` is enabled (which is the default), if a user tries to read `{\"a\":[{\"key\":{\"b\":0}}]}` with the code: \r\n```scala\r\nval df = spark.read\r\n  .schema(\"a array<map<string, struct<b boolean>>>\")\r\n  .json(path)\r\n```\r\nexception is thrown: \r\n```\r\njava.lang.ClassCastException: class org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.util.ArrayBasedMapData cannot be cast to class org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.util.ArrayData (org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.util.ArrayBasedMapData and org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.util.ArrayData are in unnamed module of loader 'app')\r\nat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.BaseGenericInternalRow.getArray(rows.scala:53)\r\nat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.BaseGenericInternalRow.getArray$(rows.scala:53)\r\nat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.GenericInternalRow.getArray(rows.scala:172)\r\nat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.GeneratedClass$SpecificUnsafeProjection.apply(Unknown Source)\r\nat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.GeneratedClass$SpecificUnsafeProjection.apply(Unknown Source)\r\nat scala.collection.Iterator$$anon$10.next(Iterator.scala:461)\r\nat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.FileScanRDD$$anon$1$$anon$2.getNext(FileScanRDD.scala:605)\r\nat org.apache.spark.util.NextIterator.hasNext(NextIterator.scala:73)\r\nat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.FileScanRDD$$anon$1.$anonfun$prepareNextFile$1(FileScanRDD.scala:884)\r\nat scala.concurrent.Future$.$anonfun$apply$1(Future.scala:659) \r\n```\r\n\r\nThe same happens when map and array are reversed: `{\"a\":{\"key\":[{\"b\":0}]}}`:\r\n```scala\r\nval df = spark.read\r\n  .schema(\"a map<string, array<struct<b boolean>>>\")\r\n  .json(path)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn both cases, we should partially parse the record, only struct with boolean type cannot be parsed: \r\n- `Row(Array(Map(\"key\" -> Row(null))))` in the first case.\r\n- `Row(Map(\"key\" -> Array(Row(null))))` in the second case.\r\n\r\nWe simply did not handle all of the partial results exceptions when converting array and map, instead of catching `PartialResultException` which is only for structs. Instead, we should catch `PartialValueException` that covers struct, map, and array.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to enforce to install `six` to Python 3.10 because `Python 3.10` is missing `six` and causes `Pandas` detection failures in CIs. \r\n- https://github.com/apache/spark/actions/runs/8525063765/job/23373974516\r\n   - Note that `pandas` is visible in the installed package list, but it fails when PySpark detects it due to the missing `six`.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/apache/apache-spark-ci-image:master-8345361470 python3.9 -m pip freeze | grep six\r\nsix==1.16.0\r\n$ docker run -it --rm

Improve the performance by optimizing lowercase comparison function for `UTF8String` instances instead of performing full lowercase conversion before binary comparison.\r\n\r\nOptimization is based on similar method used in `toLowerCase` where we check character by character if conversion is valid under ASCII and fallback to slow comparison of native strings. In latter case, we only take into consideration suffixes that are left to compare.\r\n\r\nBenchmarks from `CollationBenchmark` ran locally show substantial performance increase:\r\n```\r\n[info] collation unit benchmarks - equalsFunction:  Best Time(ms)   Avg Time(ms)   Stdev(ms)    Rate(M/s)   Per Row(ns)   Relative\r\n[info] --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[info] UTF8_BINARY_LCASE                                    7199           7209          14          0.0       71988.8       1.0X\r\n[info] UNICODE                                              3925           3929           5          0.0       39250.4       1.8X\r\n[info] UTF8_BINARY                                          3935           3950          21          0.0       39351.2       1.8X\r\n[info] UNICODE_CI                                          45248          51404        8706          0.0      452484.7       0.2X\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to support `three` methods of the log `concatenation` in the `structured logging framework`. eg:\r\n- 1.log\"... MDC(...) $normal_variables ...\"\r\n```\r\nlog\"Driver terminated with exit code ${MDC(EXIT_CODE, exitCode)}! Shutting down. $remoteAddress\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n- 2.s\"... $normal_variables ...\" ++ log\"... MDC(...) ...\"\r\n```\r\nlog\"Driver terminated with exit code ${MDC(EXIT_CODE, exitCode)}! Shutting down.\" ++ s\"$remoteAddress\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n- 3.log\"... MDC(...) ...\" ++ s\"... $normal_variables ...\"\r\n```\r\ns\"$remoteAddress\" ++ log\"Driver terminated with exit code ${MDC(EXIT_CODE, exitCode)}! Shutting down.\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSometimes we just want to make some `simple variable replacements` in the log text, without the need for MDC\r\nAt present, the above logs, `compile` will fail.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd new UT.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-04-02T07:36:02Z","updated_at":"2024-07-14T00:23:19Z","closed_at":"2024-07-14T00:23:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7107f79b80ff566bb217283511ab52efe3dec66b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45813/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45813/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/45813/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/338fbcd76ea25a5d7cdf7e889d100f5c229961ce","head":{"label":"panbingkun:SPARK-47688","ref":"SPARK-47688","sha":"338fbcd76ea25a5d7cdf7e889d100f5c229961ce","user":{"login":"panbingkun","id":15246973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQ2OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15246973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun","html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":481429011,"node_id":"R_kgDOHLIGEw","name":"spark","full_name":"panbingkun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"panbingkun","id":15246973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQ2OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15246973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun","html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to:\r\n- migrate `logError` in module `Resource managers` with variables to `structured logging framework`.\r\n- add some test case to `*LoggingSuite`\r\n- add new UT `MDCSuite`\r\n- make the `type` of `value` from `String` to `Any`( so that when using `MDC`, some code can be `omitted`, eg: `String.valueOf(...)` , `x.toString`)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo enhance Apache Spark's logging system by implementing structured logging.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Pass GA.\r\n- Add & update new UT.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR allows casting from variant to another type. It has the same semantics as `variant_get` with an empty path.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIt can bring much convenience if the user can directly cast variant into another type rather than having to use `variant_get` with an empty path.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. Casting from variant was previously not allowed but now allowd.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-04-02T02:43:08Z","updated_at":"2024-04-09T04:05:48Z","closed_at":"2024-04-09T04:05:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"70bab605ae56a40e801984a1dcfe288428358a28","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45807/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45807/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/45807/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4d33ab0c35d583fe84fd1258dc2ea9d65dd3e2c3","head":{"label":"chenhao-db:cast_from_variant","ref":"cast_from_variant","sha":"4d33ab0c35d583fe84fd1258dc2ea9d65dd3e2c3","user":{"login":"chenhao-db","id":122326661,"node_id":"U_kgDOB0qOhQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/122326661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db","html_url":"https://github.com/chenhao-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":608298960,"node_id":"R_kgDOJEHn0A","name":"oss","full_name":"chenhao-db/oss","private":false,"owner":{"login":"chenhao-db","id":122326661,"node_id":"U_kgDOB0qOhQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/122326661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db","html_url":"https://github.com/chenhao-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/chenhao-db/oss","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new `VariantExplode` expression. It separates a variant object/array into multiple rows containing its fields/elements. Its result schema is `struct<pos int, key string, value variant>`. `pos` is the position of the field/element in its parent object/array, and `value` is the field/element value. `key` is the field name when exploding a variant object, or is NULL when exploding a variant array. It ignores any input that is not a variant array/object, including SQL NULL, variant null, and any other variant values.\r\n\r\nIt is exposed as two SQL expressions, `variant_explode` and `variant_explode_outer`. The only difference is that whenever `variant_explode` produces zero output row for an input row, `variant_explode_outer` will produce one output row containing `{NULL, NULL, NULL}`.\r\n\r\nUsage examples:\r\n\r\n```\r\n> SELECT variant_explode(parse_json('[\"hello\", \"world\"]'));\r\n 0\tNULL\t\"hello\"\r\n 1\tNULL\t\"world\"\r\n> SELECT variant_explode(parse_json('{\"a\": true, \"b\": 3.14}'));\r\n 0\ta\ttrue\r\n 1\tb\t3.14\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis expression allows the user to process variant array and object more conveniently.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes.  A new SQL expression is added.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-04-02T02:29:23Z","updated_at":"2024-04-10T14:47:52Z","closed_at":"2024-04-10T14:47:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f3721993a6331a06eb167f951eec5dd455a3469d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45805/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45805/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/45805/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c6ac4887c12898bfec53197b4aa963fed3c8e28f","head":{"label":"chenhao-db:variant_explode","ref":"variant_explode","sha":"c6ac4887c12898bfec53197b4aa963fed3c8e28f","user":{"login":"chenhao-db","id":122326661,"node_id":"U_kgDOB0qOhQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/122326661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db","html_url":"https://github.com/chenhao-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":608298960,"node_id":"R_kgDOJEHn0A","name":"oss","full_name":"chenhao-db/oss","private":false,"owner":{"login":"chenhao-db","id":122326661,"node_id":"U_kgDOB0qOhQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/122326661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db","html_url":"https://github.com/chenhao-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenhao-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/chenhao-db/oss","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCheck `spark.shuffle.readHostLocalDisk` config to determine whether read shuffle block from same local host machine.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSpark has a special shuffle optimization to check whether the shuffle block is on the same local host machine, and read from local disk when possible. This local host machine check is done by comparing block ip address with current host ip address. This will cause issue when running Spark on Kubernetes, because Kubernetes may reuse pod ip when some old executor exits and the new executor starts.\r\n\r\nConsider following sequence:\r\n\r\n1. Executor 1 starts with IP address 10.0.0.1.\r\n2. Some shuffle block (e.g. block1) is written on Executor 1.\r\n3. Executor 1 terminates.\r\n4. Executor 2 starts with same IP address 10.0.0.1 (this is rare, but did happen in our test, because Kubernetes may reuse ip when launching pods).\r\n5. Executor 2 tries to read block1. It finds block1's address is same as current host address, thus assumes block1 exists on its local disk.\r\n6. Executor 2 will read from local disk and get error, since block1 is not there (block1 is on Executor 1, which is gone)\r\n\r\nThis is already a Spark config (spark.shuffle.readHostLocalDisk).

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nChanges the filter pushDown optimizer to not push down past projections of the same element if we reasonable expect that computing that element is likely to be expensive.\r\n\r\nThis introduces an \"expectedCost\" mechanism which we may or may not want. Previous filter ordering work used filter pushdowns as an approximation of expression cost but here we need more granularity. As an alternative we could introduce a flag for expensive rather than numeric operations.\r\n\r\n### Future Work / What else remains to do?\r\n\r\nRight now if a cond is expensive and it references something in the projection we don't push-down. We could probably do better and gate this on if the thing we are reference is expensive rather than the condition it's self. We could do this as a follow up item or as part of this PR.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently Spark may double compute expensive operations (like json parsing, UDF eval, etc.) as a result of filter pushdown past projections.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nSQL optimizer change may impact some user queries, results should be the same and hopefully a little faster.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew tests were added to the FilterPushDownSuite, and the initial problem of double evaluation was confirmed with a github gist \r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to support Apache Hive 4.0 Metastore where partition filters even for CHAR and a VARCHAR types can be pushed down.\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/apache/hive/releases/tag/rel%2Frelease-4.0.0\r\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?version=12343343&styleName=Text&projectId=12310843\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis is blocked by SPARK-47679 due to the incompatible change of HIVE-27925 .\r\n- https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/45804\r\n\r\nSupporting more Hive versions (with extra performance improvement) is good for our users.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. Regarding supporting Hive 4.0 metastore the documentation is updated accordingly.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n#### Manually\r\n\r\nI used the docker image of apache/hive:4.0.0-beta-1 for starting a metastore and a hiveserver2 (along with a hadoop3 docker image).\r\n\r\nCreated a table:\r\n```\r\nCREATE EXTERNAL TABLE testTable1 ( \r\n  column1 String \r\n) PARTITIONED BY (partColumn1 CHAR(30), partColumn2 VARCHAR(30)) LOCATION 'hdfs://hadoop3:8020/tmp/hive_external/';\r\n```\r\n\r\nInserted some values in beeline:\r\n\r\n```\r\ninsert into table testtable1 values (\"column1_v1\", \"partcolumn1_v1\", \"partcolumn2_v1\"), (\"column1_v2\", \"partcolumn1_v2\", \"partcolumn2_v2\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nStarted my spark in the hiveserver2 container as:\r\n```\r\n./bin/spark-shell --conf spark.sql.hive.metastore.version=4.0.0 --conf spark.sql.hive.metastore.jars=\"/opt/hive/lib/*\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nRun the query as:\r\n```\r\nscala> sql(\"select * from testtable1 where partcolumn1 = 'partcolumn1_v1' and partcolumn2 = 'partcolumn2_v1'\").show\r\nHive Session ID = 6846fe0e-968a-474d-afec-4f67b3a2a274\r\n+----------+--------------------+--------------+\r\n|   column1|         partcolumn1|   partcolumn2|\r\n+----------+--------------------+--------------+\r\n|column1_v1|partcolumn1_v1   ...|partcolumn2_v1|\r\n+----------+--------------------+--------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd check the HMS calls in the metastore container in the file `/tmp/hive/hive.log`:\r\n```\r\n...\r\n2023-09-22T21:06:34,293  INFO [Metastore-Handler-Pool: Thread-1356] HiveMetaStore.audit: ugi=hive       ip=172.30.0.5   cmd=source:172.30.0.5 get_partitions_by_filter : tbl=hive.default.testtable1\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich contains the expected `get_partitions_by_filter`.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to use AWS SDK v2 `2.23.19` in `kubernetes/integration-tests` which is consistent with SPARK-45393.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSince SPARK-45393, Apache Spark uses `software.amazon.awssdk:bundle:2.23.19` which is higher than the current value of `aws.java.sdk.v2.version`,

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIt's quite confusing to report `TASK_WRITE_FAILED` error when the error was caused by input query execution. This PR updates the error wrapping code to not wrap with `TASK_WRITE_FAILED` if the error was from input query execution.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR proposes to replace  _LEGACY_ERROR_TEMP_2011 with UNEXPECTED_DATA_TYPE, as part of the parent initiative of SPARK-37935\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo rename the legacy error class as part of the refactoring effort, and simplify Spark's error handling aspect.  \r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have tried to test `QueryExecutionErrors.typeUnsupportedError` also. Still, by understanding the SQL module code base better, seem there is no way to do that, as all inferred types generated by `inferPartitionColumnValue( )` are already covered by `castPartValueToDesiredType( )`.\r\nAlso, I have tried the approach of custom type, but by doing so `castPartValueToDesiredType( )` will be

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nWe want to support timer feature during initial state handling. Currently, if grouping key introduced in initial state is never seen again in new input rows, those rows in initial state will never be emitted. We want to add a field in initial state handling function such that users can manipulate the timers with initial state rows.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThese changes are needed to support timer with initial state. The changes are part of the work around adding new stateful streaming operator for arbitrary state mgmt that provides a bunch of new features listed in the SPIP JIRA here - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-45939\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. We add a new `timerValues` field in `StatefulProcessorWithInitialState`:\r\n```\r\n  /**\r\n   * Function that will be invoked only in the first batch for users to process initial states.\r\n   *\r\n   * @param key - grouping key\r\n   * @param initialState - A row in the initial state to be processed\r\n   * @param timerValues  - instance of TimerValues that provides access to current processing/event\r\n   *                     time if available\r\n   */\r\n  def handleInitialState(key: K, initialState: S, timerValues: TimerValues): Unit\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nAdd unit tests in `TransformWithStateWithInitialStateSuite`\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool

See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nSupport the log concatenation in the structured logging framework. For example\r\n```\r\nlog\"${MDC(CONFIG, SHUFFLE_MAPOUTPUT_MIN_SIZE_FOR_BROADCAST.key)} \" +\r\n  log\"(${MDC(MIN_SIZE, minSizeForBroadcast.toString)} bytes) \" +\r\n  log\"must be <= spark.rpc.message.maxSize (${MDC(MAX_SIZE, maxRpcMessageSize.toString)} \" +\r\n  log\"bytes) to prevent sending an rpc message that is too large.\" \r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAlthough most of the Spark logs are short, we need this convenient syntax when handling long logs with multiple variables.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nNew UT\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd support for negative numeric types and range scan key encoder\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWithout this change, sort ordering for `-ve` numbers is not maintained on iteration. Negative numbers would appear last previously. Note that only non-floating integer types such as `short, integer, long` are supported for signed values. For float/double, we cannot simply prepend a sign byte given the way floating point values are stored in the IEEE 754 floating point representation. Additionally we also need to flip all the bits and convert them back to the original value on read, in order to support these types.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to make the `parameter inputs` of the function `[csv|parquet|orc|json|text|xml](paths: String*)` `non empty` when not explicitly specify the schema.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n- it's a bit weird when the `inputs` is empty, `text()` can actually run successfully.\r\n- when the `inputs` is empty, various prompts may vary.\r\n\r\n- Before\r\n  <img width=\"1004\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/15246973/7dd75493-ae46-446c-b81d-d100fd99bcf2\">\r\n\r\n- After\r\n  <img width=\"581\"

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nModify `LateralJoin` to include right-side plan output in `allAttributes`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn the following example, the view v1 is cached, but a query of v1 does not use the cache:\r\n```\r\nCREATE or REPLACE TEMP VIEW t1(c1, c2) AS VALUES (0, 1), (1, 2);\r\nCREATE or REPLACE TEMP VIEW t2(c1, c2) AS VALUES (0, 1), (1, 2);\r\n\r\ncreate or replace temp view v1 as\r\nselect *\r\nfrom t1\r\njoin lateral (\r\n  select c1 as a, c2 as b\r\n  from t2)\r\non c1 = a;\r\n\r\ncache table v1;\r\n\r\nexplain select * from v1;\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\nAdaptiveSparkPlan isFinalPlan=false\r\n+- BroadcastHashJoin [c1#180], [a#173], Inner, BuildRight, false\r\n   :- LocalTableScan [c1#180, c2#181]\r\n   +- BroadcastExchange HashedRelationBroadcastMode(List(cast(input[0, int, false] as bigint)),false), [plan_id=113]\r\n      +- LocalTableScan [a#173, b#174]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe canonicalized version of the `LateralJoin` node is not consistent when there is a join condition. For example, for the above query, the join condition is canonicalized as follows:\r\n```\r\nBefore canonicalization: Some((c1#174 = a#167))\r\nAfter canonicalization:  Some((none#0 = none#167))\r\n```\r\nYou can see that the `exprId` for the second operand of `EqualTo` is not normalized (it remains 167). That's because the attribute `a` from the right-side plan is not included `allAttributes`.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds right-side attributes to `allAttributes` so that references to right-side attributes in the join condition are normalized during canonicalization.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew test.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFollow-up to https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/45703, which added validation for the Parquet vectorized reader. When the vectorized reader is disabled, we do not go through the code path that was modified in that PR. This PR adds the same checks for when the parquet-mr reader is used.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nImproved error checking.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, Variant has not yet been released.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nModified the previous test to also run with the vectorized reader disabled. It fails without the changes in this PR.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-03-28T14:14:20Z","updated_at":"2024-03-29T02:49:25Z","closed_at":"2024-03-29T02:49:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"080322ec7a6bd160bc8b78756d5a500c90a38555","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45755/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/45755/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/45755/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8359f646ecb661c816ab0d31b49d36bb08cb7ad3","head":{"label":"cashmand:SPARK-47546-parquet-mr","ref":"SPARK-47546-parquet-mr","sha":"8359f646ecb661c816ab0d31b49d36bb08cb7ad3","user":{"login":"cashmand","id":54722026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NzIyMDI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54722026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand","html_url":"https://github.com/cashmand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":469837514,"node_id":"R_kgDOHAEmyg","name":"spark","full_name":"cashmand/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cashmand","id":54722026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NzIyMDI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54722026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand","html_url":"https://github.com/cashmand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cashmand/spark","description":"Apache
