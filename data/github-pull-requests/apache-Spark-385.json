(This is also consistent with ML `LogisticRegression`.)\n- BTW, if we use a known updater(L1 or L2) for binary classification, `LogisticRegressionWithLBFGS` will call the ML implementation. We should update the API doc to clarifying `numCorrections` will have no effect if we fall into that route.\n- Make a pass for all parameters of `LogisticRegressionWithLBFGS`, others are set

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nRemove old deprecated ThreadPoolExecutor and replace with ExecutionContext using a ForkJoinPool. The downside of this is that scala's ForkJoinPool doesn't give us a way to specify the thread pool name (and is a wrapper of Java's in 2.12) except by providing a custom factory. Note that we can't use Java's ForkJoinPool directly in Scala 2.11 since it uses a ExecutionContext which reports system parallelism. One other implicit change that happens is the old ExecutionContext would have reported a different default parallelism since it used system parallelism rather than threadpool parallelism (this was likely not intended but also likely not a huge difference).\n\nThe previous version of this PR attempted to use an execution context constructed on the ThreadPool (but not the deprecated ThreadPoolExecutor class) so as to keep the ability to have human readable named threads but this reported system parallelism.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nunit tests: streaming/testOnly

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nAfter analysis by Analyzer, two operators could have alias. They are `Project` and `Aggregate`. So far, we only rewrite and propagate constraints if `Alias` is defined in `Project`. This PR is to resolve this issue in `Aggregate`.\n#### How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded a test case for `Aggregate` in `ConstraintPropagationSuite`.\n\n@marmbrus @sameeragarwal

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nNested classes defined within Scala objects are translated into Java static nested classes. Unlike inner classes, they don't need outer scopes. But the analyzer still thinks that an outer scope is required.\n\nThis PR fixes this issue simply by checking whether a nested class is static before looking up its outer scope.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nA test case is added to `DatasetSuite`. It checks contents of a Dataset whose element type is a nested class declared in a Scala object.\n","created_at":"2016-02-28T16:22:30Z","updated_at":"2016-02-29T17:12:19Z","closed_at":"2016-02-29T17:09:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"45d2c9a01545ee7a836f0c1cb73c4ceb1cf34f3d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11421/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11421/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11421/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e70788159c58e65aa15587e4d6b5416509e45754","head":{"label":"liancheng:spark-13540-object-as-outer-scope","ref":"spark-13540-object-as-outer-scope","sha":"e70788159c58e65aa15587e4d6b5416509e45754","user":{"login":"liancheng","id":230655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng","html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17232535,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzMjUzNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"liancheng/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"liancheng","id":230655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng","html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng/spark","description":"Mirror

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-13537\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIn readBytes of VectorizedPlainValuesReader, we use buffer[offset] to access bytes in buffer. It is incorrect because offset is added with Platform.BYTE_ARRAY_OFFSET when initialization. We should fix it.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\n`ParquetHadoopFsRelationSuite` sometimes (depending on the randomly generated data) will be [failed](https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/SparkPullRequestBuilder/52136/consoleFull) by this bug. After applying this, the test can be passed.\n\nI added a test to `ParquetHadoopFsRelationSuite` with the data which will fail without this patch.\n\nThe error exception:\n\n```\n[info]

like:\n\n![subquery](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/40902/13377963/932bcbae-dda7-11e5-82f7-03c9be85d77c.png)\n\nThis PR also change the tree structure of WholeStageCodegen to make it consistent than others. Before this change, Both WholeStageCodegen and InputAdapter hold a references to the same plans, those could be updated without notify another, causing problems, this is discovered by #11403 .\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting tests, also manual tests with the example query, check the explain and web UI.\n","created_at":"2016-02-28T07:16:21Z","updated_at":"2016-03-04T01:38:32Z","closed_at":"2016-03-04T01:38:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c19ffe4bd96e0c7d1f2dfb9e60e6c69b5a278900","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11417/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11417/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11417/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e69262ae6d4648f4f0314b0c05e898fd239996b2","head":{"label":"davies:viz_subquery","ref":"viz_subquery","sha":"e69262ae6d4648f4f0314b0c05e898fd239996b2","user":{"login":"davies","id":40902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies","html_url":"https://github.com/davies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21724875,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTcyNDg3NQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"davies/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"davies","id":40902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies","html_url":"https://github.com/davies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/davies/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWhen missing sort attributes are not in the output of `Transform`, we should not bypass it and check its child nodes. Like `subquery`, we should not continue finding the missing attributes in its child nodes.\n#### How was this patch tested?\n\nThis is an internal code bug. So far, unable to trigger the external behavior difference. The newly added code is just for covering and verifying it.\n","created_at":"2016-02-28T06:22:37Z","updated_at":"2016-04-19T09:15:46Z","closed_at":"2016-04-19T09:15:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1084d53b8217c4ef1c44054b354372045ef5cee0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11416/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11416/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11416/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1199ca8ab4d6ab6c15a1a391f4cf63dbc9fd9851","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:missingSortAttrInTransform","ref":"missingSortAttrInTransform","sha":"1199ca8ab4d6ab6c15a1a391f4cf63dbc9fd9851","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\ncase classes defined in REPL are wrapped by line classes, and we have a trick for scala 2.10 REPL to automatically register the wrapper classes to `OuterScope` so that we can use when create encoders.\nHowever, this trick doesn't work right after we upgrade to scala 2.11, and unfortunately the tests are only in scala 2.10, which makes this bug hidden until now.\n\nThis PR moves the encoder tests to scala 2.11  `ReplSuite`, and fixes this bug by another approach(the previous trick can't port to scala 2.11 REPL): make `OuterScope` smarter that can detect classes defined in REPL and load the singleton of line wrapper classes automatically. \n## How was this patch tested?\n\nthe migrated encoder tests in `ReplSuite`\n","created_at":"2016-02-27T09:40:28Z","updated_at":"2016-03-24T07:36:26Z","closed_at":"2016-03-21T17:39:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f552b3fdfa8a7821eccb77464394fbff7bace838","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11410/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11410/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11410/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/47e0e393c907ffa54ac23c9902f5db00dcbca147","head":{"label":"cloud-fan:repl","ref":"repl","sha":"47e0e393c907ffa54ac23c9902f5db00dcbca147","user":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19689699,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTY4OTY5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"cloud-fan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nRemove all the deterministic conditions in a [[Filter]] that are contained in the Child's Constraints.\n\nFor example, the first query can be simplified to the second one.\n\n``` scala\n    val queryWithUselessFilter = tr1\n      .where(\"tr1.a\".attr > 10 || \"tr1.c\".attr < 10)\n      .join(tr2.where('d.attr < 100), Inner,

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis creates a `SessionState`, which groups a few fields that existed in `SQLContext`. Because `HiveContext` extends `SQLContext` we also need to make changes there. This is mainly a cleanup task that will soon pave the way for merging the two contexts.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting unit tests; this patch introduces no change in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIt’s possible to have common parts in a query, for example, self join, it will be good to avoid the duplicated part to same CPUs and memory (Broadcast or cache).\n\nExchange will materialize the underlying RDD by shuffle or collect, it’s a great point to check duplicates and reuse them. Duplicated exchanges means they generate exactly the same result inside a query.\n\nIn order to find out the duplicated exchanges, we should be able to compare SparkPlan to check that they have same results or not. We already have that for LogicalPlan, so we should move that into QueryPlan to make it available for SparkPlan.\n\nOnce we can find the duplicated exchanges, we should replace all of them with same SparkPlan object (could be wrapped by ReusedExchage for explain), then the plan tree become a DAG.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWe provide a very limited set of cluster management script in Spark for Tachyon, although Tachyon itself provides a much better version of it. Given now Spark users can simply use Tachyon as a normal file system and does not require extensive configurations, we can remove this management capabilities to simplify Spark bash scripts.\n\nNote that this also reduces coupling between a 3rd party external system and Spark's release scripts, and would eliminate possibility for failures such as Tachyon being renamed or the tar balls being

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWhen the driver removes an executor's state, the connection between the driver and the executor may be still alive so that the executor cannot exit automatically (E.g., Master will send RemoveExecutor when a work is lost but the executor is still alive), so the driver should try to tell the executor to stop itself. Otherwise, we will leak an executor.\n\nThis PR modified the driver to send `StopExecutor` to the executor when it's removed.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nmanual test: increase the worker heartbeat interval to force it's always timeout and the leak executors are

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-13511\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrent limit operator doesn't support wholestage codegen. This is open to add support for it.\n\nIn the `doConsume` of `GlobalLimit` and `LocalLimit`, we use a count term to count the processed rows. Once the row numbers catches the limit number, we set the variable `stopEarly` of `BufferedRowIterator` newly added in this pr to `true` that indicates we want to stop processing remaining rows. Then when the wholestage codegen framework checks `shouldStop()`, it will stop the processing of the row iterator.\n\nBefore this, the executed plan for a query `sqlContext.range(N).limit(100).groupBy().sum()` is:\n\n```\nTungstenAggregate(key=[], functions=[(sum(id#5L),mode=Final,isDistinct=false)], output=[sum(id)#6L])\n+- TungstenAggregate(key=[], functions=[(sum(id#5L),mode=Partial,isDistinct=false)], output=[sum#9L])\n   +- GlobalLimit 100\n      +- Exchange SinglePartition, None\n         +- LocalLimit 100\n            +- Range 0, 1, 1, 524288000, [id#5L]\n```\n\nAfter add wholestage codegen support:\n\n```\nWholeStageCodegen\n:  +- TungstenAggregate(key=[], functions=[(sum(id#40L),mode=Final,isDistinct=false)],

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis is another try of PR #11323.\n\nThis PR removes DataFrame RDD operations except for `foreach` and `foreachPartitions` (they are actions rather than transformations). Original calls are now replaced by calls to methods of `DataFrame.rdd`.\n\nPR #11323 was reverted because it introduced a regression: both `DataFrame.foreach` and `DataFrame.foreachPartitions` wrap underlying RDD operations with `withNewExecutionId` to track Spark jobs. But they are removed in #11323.\n## How was the this patch tested?\n\nNo extra tests are added. Existing tests should do the work.\n","created_at":"2016-02-26T08:17:37Z","updated_at":"2016-03-01T05:27:40Z","closed_at":"2016-02-26T16:30:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"de878cd5ee5f571888b4785f8ae9910a72d9f13a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11388/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11388/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11388/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/153da19164f97a678540b06802c5f0191284b305","head":{"label":"liancheng:remove-df-rdd-ops","ref":"remove-df-rdd-ops","sha":"153da19164f97a678540b06802c5f0191284b305","user":{"login":"liancheng","id":230655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng","html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17232535,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzMjUzNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"liancheng/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"liancheng","id":230655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng","html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng/spark","description":"Mirror

(https://github.com/google/guava/commit/fd0cbc2c5c90e85fb22c8e86ea19630032090943) and it's possible that some classpath issues affecting Unidoc could be causing this to trigger compilation failures. \n\nIn order to work around this issue, this patch removes this use of Stopwatch since we don't use it anywhere else in the Spark

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR adds an optimizer rule to eliminate reading (unnecessary) NULL values if they are not required for correctness by inserting `isNotNull` filters is the query plan. These filters are currently inserted beneath existing `Filter` and `Join` operators and are inferred based on their data constraints.\n\nNote: While this optimization is applicable to all types of join, it primarily benefits `Inner` and `LeftSemi` joins.\n## How was this patch tested?\n1. Added a new `NullFilteringSuite` that tests for `IsNotNull` filters in the query plan for joins and filters. Also, tests interaction with the `CombineFilters` optimizer rules.\n2. Test generated ExpressionTrees via `OrcFilterSuite`\n3. Test filter source pushdown logic via `SimpleTextHadoopFsRelationSuite`\n\ncc @yhuai @nongli

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nPreviously the Mesos framework webui URL was being derived only from the Spark UI address leaving no possibility to configure it. This commit makes it configurable. If unset it falls back to the previous behavior.\n\nMotivation:\nThis change is necessary in order to be able to install Spark on DCOS and to be able to give it a custom service link. The configured `webui_url` is configured to point to a reverse proxy in the DCOS environment.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nLocally, using unit tests and on DCOS testing and stable revision.\n","created_at":"2016-02-25T13:19:56Z","updated_at":"2016-08-02T21:01:12Z","closed_at":"2016-03-10T02:11:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"61233e70af0088dc9876aeae230c673970314e65","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11369/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11369/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11369/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/46ea0abfc47d36067ad258cdbdbd6a2a47ebef56","head":{"label":"d2iq-archive:sur-webui-url","ref":"sur-webui-url","sha":"46ea0abfc47d36067ad258cdbdbd6a2a47ebef56","user":{"login":"d2iq-archive","id":184508684,"node_id":"O_kgDOCv9hDA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184508684?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive","html_url":"https://github.com/d2iq-archive","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34087729,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDA4NzcyOQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"d2iq-archive/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"d2iq-archive","id":184508684,"node_id":"O_kgDOCv9hDA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184508684?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive","html_url":"https://github.com/d2iq-archive","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d2iq-archive/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/d2iq-archive/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nAFTSurvivalRegression should support feature standardization, it will improve the convergence rate.\nTest the convergence rate on the [Ovarian](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/survival/html/ovarian.html) data which is standard data comes with Survival library in R,\n- without standardization(before this PR) -> 74 iterations.\n- with standardization(after this PR) -> 38 iterations.\n\nBut after this fix, with or without `standardization` will converge to the same solution. It means that `standardization = false` will run the same code route as `standardization = true`. Because if the features are not standardized at all, it will result convergency issue when the features have very different scales. This behavior is the same as ML [`LinearRegression` and `LogisticRegression`](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-8522).

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis change adds a workaround to allow users to drop a table with a name starting with an underscore. Without this patch, we can create such a table, but we cannot drop it. The reason is that Hive's parser unquote an quoted identifier (see https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/release-1.2.1/ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/parse/HiveLexer.g#L453). So, when we issue a drop table command to Hive, a table name starting with an underscore is actually not quoted. Then, Hive will complain about it because it does not support a table name starting with an underscore without using backticks (underscores are allowed as long as it is not the first char though).\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdd a test to make sure we can drop a table with a name starting with an underscore.\n\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-13454\n","created_at":"2016-02-24T18:46:04Z","updated_at":"2016-02-26T22:34:56Z","closed_at":"2016-02-26T22:34:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"424714765813f93c2af3c02f1ef7570c6b22889e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11349/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11349/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11349/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ce05f8b85060bb9f1a9d9eca04e4f266ffa5e85b","head":{"label":"yhuai:fixDropTable","ref":"fixDropTable","sha":"ce05f8b85060bb9f1a9d9eca04e4f266ffa5e85b","user":{"login":"yhuai","id":2072857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNzI4NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2072857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai","html_url":"https://github.com/yhuai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:branch-1.6","ref":"branch-1.6","sha":"abe8f991a32bef92fbbcd2911836bb7d8e61ca97","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR introduce a new API: Python dataset. Conceptually it's a combination of Python DataFrame and Python RDD, supports both typed operations(e.g. map, flatMap, filter, etc.) and untyped operations(e.g. select, sort, etc.). This is a simpler version of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/11117, without the aggregate part.\n\nThere are 3 ways(can be more) to add the `Dataset` API to python:\n- Extending `DataFrame` to support typed operations and alias it with `Dataset`\n\n```\n# conceptually there is only DataFrame, but users can call it Dataset if they like\ndf = sqlContext.createDataFrame(...)\ndf2 = df.map(...)\ndf3 = df2.select(...)\ndf4 = df2.applySchema(...)\n```\n- Renaming `DataFrame` to `Dataset`, and alias `Dataset` with `DataFrame` for compatibility(so conceptually we only have Dataset). We also need to rename a lot of related stuff like `createDataFrame`, some documents, etc.\n\n```\n# conceptually there is only Dataset, but previous users can still use DataFrame\n# for compatibility\nds = sqlContext.createDataset(...)\nds2 = ds.map(...)\nds3 = ds2.select(...)\nds4 = ds2.applySchema(...)\n```\n- Add typed operations in `DataFrame` and make `Dataset` extend `DataFrame`. Typed operations will always return `Dataset`, structured operations will always return `DataFrame`, and `Dataset` has an extra API called `applySchema` to turn it into `DataFrame`.\n\n```\n# We have

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis updates the hive dependency from 1.2.1.spark to 1.2.1.1.spark, an update which does nothing but\n1. Update the POM\n2. Update groovy to 2.4.4\n\nIn doing so it ensures that CVE-2015-3253 is not passed on to applications pulling in spark-hive via POM dependencies.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nFull tests ongoing; basic build & hive tests seemed happy. This only works with a local build of `org.spark-project.hive` of 1.2.1.1.spark with the modified groovy dependency; Jenkins will fail to build until the artifact is actually published. ( see [https://github.com/pwendell/hive/pull/1] \n\naudit of maven dependencies shows that later groovy version is picked up\n\n```\n[INFO] +-

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-13466\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWith column pruning rule in optimizer, some Project operators will become redundant. We should remove these redundant Projects.\n\nFor an example query:\n\n```\nval input = LocalRelation('key.int, 'value.string)\n\nval query =\n  Project(Seq($\"x.key\", $\"y.key\"),\n    Join(\n      SubqueryAlias(\"x\", input),\n      BroadcastHint(SubqueryAlias(\"y\", input)), Inner, None))\n```\n\nAfter the first run of column pruning, it would like:\n\n```\nProject(Seq($\"x.key\", $\"y.key\"),\n  Join(\n    Project(Seq($\"x.key\"), SubqueryAlias(\"x\", input)),\n    Project(Seq($\"y.key\"),      <-- inserted by the rule\n    BroadcastHint(SubqueryAlias(\"y\", input))),\n    Inner, None))\n```\n\nActually we don't need the outside Project now.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nTaskContext supports task completion callback, which gets called regardless of task failures.

PR adds a new abstraction called an `ExpressionSet` which attempts to canonicalize expressions to remove cosmetic differences.  Deterministic expressions that are in the set after canonicalization will always return the same answer given the same input (i.e. false positives should not be possible). However, it is possible that two canonical expressions that are not equal will in fact return the same answer given any input (i.e. false negatives are possible).\n\n``` scala\nval set = AttributeSet('a + 1 :: 1 + 'a :: Nil)\n\nset.iterator => Iterator('a + 1)\nset.contains('a + 1) => true\nset.contains(1 + 'a) => true\nset.contains('a + 2) => false\n```\n\nOther relevant changes include:\n- Since this concept overlaps with the existing `semanticEquals` and `semanticHash`, those functions are also ported to this new infrastructure.\n- A memoized `canonicalized` version of the expression is added as a `lazy val` to `Expression` and is used by both `semanticEquals` and `ExpressionSet`.\n- A set of unit tests for `ExpressionSet` are added\n- Tests which expect `semanticEquals` to be less intelligent than it now is are updated.\n\nAs a followup, we should consider auditing the places where we do `O(n)` `semanticEquals` operations and replace them with `ExpressionSet`.  We should also consider consolidating `AttributeSet` as a specialized factory for an `ExpressionSet.`\n","created_at":"2016-02-24T00:54:33Z","updated_at":"2016-03-08T00:04:37Z","closed_at":"2016-02-25T03:44:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9b62ada2da189af2c2b06757a4f1811485e7b637","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11338/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11338/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11338/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a255d957a400ecbef113e6f74e385786db0cd5a7","head":{"label":"marmbrus:expressionSet","ref":"expressionSet","sha":"a255d957a400ecbef113e6f74e385786db0cd5a7","user":{"login":"marmbrus","id":527,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/527?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus","html_url":"https://github.com/marmbrus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17230869,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzMDg2OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"marmbrus/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"marmbrus","id":527,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/527?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus","html_url":"https://github.com/marmbrus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/marmbrus/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\n`scala.collection.Iterator`'s methods (e.g., map, filter) will return an `AbstractIterator` which is not Serializable. E.g.,\n\n``` Scala\nscala> val iter = Array(1, 2, 3).iterator.map(_ + 1)\niter: Iterator[Int] = non-empty iterator\n\nscala> println(iter.isInstanceOf[Serializable])\nfalse\n```\n\nIf we call something like `Iterator.map(...).toSeq`, it will create a `Stream` that contains a non-serializable `AbstractIterator` field and make the `Stream` be non-serializable.\n\nThis PR uses `toArray` instead of `toSeq` to fix such issue in `def createDataFrame(data: java.util.List[_], beanClass: Class[_]): DataFrame`.  \n## How was the this patch tested?\n\nJenkins

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR adds equality operators to UDT classes so that they can be correctly tested for dataType equality during union operations.\n\nThis was previously causing `\"AnalysisException: u\"unresolved operator 'Union;\"\"` when trying to unionAll two dataframes with UDT columns as below.\n\n```\nfrom pyspark.sql.tests import PythonOnlyPoint, PythonOnlyUDT\nfrom pyspark.sql import types\n\nschema = types.StructType([types.StructField(\"point\", PythonOnlyUDT(), True)])\n\na = sqlCtx.createDataFrame([[PythonOnlyPoint(1.0, 2.0)]], schema)\nb = sqlCtx.createDataFrame([[PythonOnlyPoint(3.0, 4.0)]], schema)\n\nc = a.unionAll(b)\n```\n## How was the this patch tested?\n\nTested using two unit tests in sql/test.py and the DataFrameSuite.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently, BroadcastNestedLoopJoin is implemented for worst case, it's too slow, very easy to hang forever. This PR will create fast path for some joinType and buildSide, also improve the worst case (will use much less memory than before).\n\nBefore this PR, one task requires O(N*K) + O(K) in worst cases, N is number of rows from one partition of streamed table, it could hang the job (because of GC). \n\nIn order to workaround this for InnerJoin, we have to disable auto-broadcast, switch to CartesianProduct: This could be workaround for InnerJoin, see https://forums.databricks.com/questions/6747/how-do-i-get-a-cartesian-product-of-a-huge-dataset.html \n\nIn this PR, we will have fast path for these joins :\n\n InnerJoin with BuildLeft or BuildRight\n LeftOuterJoin with BuildRight\n RightOuterJoin with BuildLeft\n LeftSemi with BuildRight\n\nThese fast paths are all stream based (take one pass on streamed table), required O(1) memory.\n\nAll other join types and build types will take two pass on streamed table, one pass to find the matched rows that includes streamed part, which require O(1) memory, another pass to find the rows from build table that does not have a matched row from streamed table, which required O(K) memory, K is the number rows from build side, one bit per row, should be much smaller than the memory for broadcast. The following join types work in this way:\n\nLeftOuterJoin with BuildLeft\nRightOuterJoin with BuildRight\nFullOuterJoin with BuildLeft or BuildRight\nLeftSemi with BuildLeft\n\nThis PR also added tests for all the join types for BroadcastNestedLoopJoin.\n\nAfter this PR, for InnerJoin with one small table, BroadcastNestedLoopJoin should be faster than CartesianProduct, we don't need that workaround anymore.\n## How was the this patch tested?\n\nAdded unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\ncoalesce doesn't handle UnionRDD with partial locality properly.  I had a user who had a UnionRDD that was made up of mapPartitionRDD without preferred locations and a checkpointedRDD with preferred locations (getting from hdfs).  It took the driver over 20 minutes to setup the groups and put the partitions into those groups before it even started any tasks.  Even perhaps worse is it didn't end up with the number of partitions he was asking for because it didn't put a partition in each of the groups properly.\n\nThe changes in this patch get rid of a n^2 while loop that was causing the 20 minutes, it properly distributes the partitions to have at least one per group, and it changes from using the rotation iterator which got the preferred locations many times to get all the preferred locations once up front.  \n\nNote that the n^2 while loop that I removed in setupGroups took so long because all of the partitions with preferred locations were already assigned to group, so it basically looped through every single one and wasn't ever able to assign it.  At the time I had 960 partitions with preferred locations and 1020 without and did the outer while loop 319 times because that is the # of groups left to create.  Note that each of those times through the inner while loop is going off to hdfs to get the block locations, so this is extremely inefficient.\n## How was the this patch tested?\n\nAdded unit tests for this case and ran existing ones that applied to make sure no regressions. \nAlso manually tested on the users production job to make sure it fixed their issue.  It created the proper number of partitions and now it takes about 6 seconds rather then 20 minutes.\n I did also run some basic manual tests with spark-shell doing coalesced to smaller number, same number, and then greater with shuffle.\n","created_at":"2016-02-23T19:06:01Z","updated_at":"2016-05-03T20:45:12Z","closed_at":"2016-05-03T20:45:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"92be0f87f31c6a715f94c875f41d7b2ad98dde62","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11327/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11327/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11327/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/305a7db60a2fc836035ed06c8207ce772c5e3b23","head":{"label":"tgravescs:SPARK-11316","ref":"SPARK-11316","sha":"305a7db60a2fc836035ed06c8207ce772c5e3b23","user":{"login":"tgravescs","id":4563792,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjM3OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4563792?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs","html_url":"https://github.com/tgravescs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17249522,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzI0OTUyMg==","name":"spark","full_name":"tgravescs/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tgravescs","id":4563792,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjM3OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4563792?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs","html_url":"https://github.com/tgravescs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgravescs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tgravescs/spark","description":"Mirror
