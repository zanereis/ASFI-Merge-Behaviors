-->\r\n\r\n1. 限制从节点分级存储行为\r\n1.1. 修改 `MessageStoreDispatcherImpl#dispatch`：从节点不将消息分发到分级存储；\r\n1.2. 修改 `FlatFileStore#load`：从节点不进行 recover 操作；\r\n2. 主从节点数据同步\r\n2.1. 在`SlaveSynchronize#syncAll` 中增加 `syncTieredMetadata`方法，定时同步分级存储元数据；\r\n2.2. 在 `BrokerController` 中增加 `SyncTieredIndexService`，同步`DispatchRequest`以使得从节点可以构建`IndexFile`；\r\n3. 从节点切主时执行数据恢复\r\n3.1 在`TieredMessageStore`中增加接口`RecoverService`，负责切主时恢复`Metadata`，`FlatFile`与`IndexFile`；若冷存中文件信息与本地元数据出现不一致，以冷存为准；\r\n4. 其他\r\n4.1. 修改部分日志，使其更为合理；\r\n4.2.

Modify the `metricsExporterType` within the `brokerConfig` to `PROM`, which will export data in Prometheus format.\r\n...\r\n```java\r\nprivate MetricsExporterType metricsExporterType = MetricsExporterType.PROM;\r\n...\r\nprivate int metricsPromExporterPort = 5557;\r\nprivate String metricsPromExporterHost = \"127.0.0.1\";\r\n...\r\n```\r\n2. Initiate both the broker and nameserver processes.\r\n3. Execute the following command in the local terminal: `curl localhost:<export_port>` (default is `5557`), then verify that the output metrics align with

Which Issue(s) This PR Fixes\r\n\r\nFixes #8092 \r\n\r\n### Brief Description\r\n\r\nThe test `org.apache.rocketmq.filter.FilterSpiTest#testRegister` is non-idempotent, as it passes in the first run but fails in the second run in the same JVM. The test fails in subsequent runs in the same environment because it registers a `NothingFilter` without unregistering it. The repeated run will then throw a `Filter already exist` error. A fix is recommended as unit tests shall be idempotent, and state pollution shall be mitigated so that newly introduced tests do not fail in the future due to polluted shared states.\r\n\r\n### Failure Message in the 2nd Run:\r\n```\r\njava.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Filter spi type(Nothing) already exist!\r\n\tat org.apache.rocketmq.filter.FilterFactory.register(FilterFactory.java:44)\r\n\tat org.apache.rocketmq.filter.FilterSpiTest.testRegister(FilterSpiTest.java:53)\r\n\tat java.base/java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:568)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How Did You Test This Change?\r\nUnset `NothingFilter` before exiting the test. All tests pass and are idempotent after the
