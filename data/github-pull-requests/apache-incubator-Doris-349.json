Proposed changes\r\n\r\n- We find that the execution efficiency of statements like `where a in (...) and b in (...) ......` is very poor, especially when the `max_scan_key_num` and the number of column are large.\r\n- Every time this function `RowCursor::init_scan_key` is called in the for-loop, a duplicate object, `schema`, which owns a `vector<Field*>` inside, will be created.\r\n- So we want to construct this object outside the for-loop, and make it be shared by multiple `row_cursor`\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [ ] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have created an issue on (Enhancement #6098 ) and described the feature there in detail\r\n- [x] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] If these changes need document changes, I have updated the document\r\n- [x] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\n- I am not sure if this change will break the original code structure.","created_at":"2021-06-26T12:51:55Z","updated_at":"2021-07-21T02:50:31Z","closed_at":"2021-07-21T02:50:31Z","merged_at":"2021-07-21T02:50:31Z","merge_commit_sha":"2d78c31d4956f24ebce106e23680e85dcbe5e030","assignee":{"login":"yangzhg","id":9098473,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwOTg0NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9098473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg","html_url":"https://github.com/yangzhg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"yangzhg","id":9098473,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwOTg0NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9098473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg","html_url":"https://github.com/yangzhg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangzhg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":665965628,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2NjU5NjU2Mjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/kind/improvement","name":"kind/improvement","color":"84b6eb","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1127326390,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTI3MzI2Mzkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/good%20first%20issue","name":"good

errorRows) and errorRowsAfterResumed.\r\n\r\n## Proposed changes\r\n\r\nWhen an routine load job's currentErrorRows is greater than maxErrorNum, the job will be paused. Users can use `resume routine load for xxx;` to make the job be running again.\r\nThen, there will be a problem, the indicator called `errorRows` won't be reset to `0`. But as `totalErrorRows`, it is useful. So we need to add an indicator called  errorRowsAfterResumed to distinguish  between totalErrorRows(called `errorRows`) and `errorRowsAfterResumed`. We can get useful infomation through `errorRowsAfterResumed` , and determine whether some Propterties are reasonable or not.\r\n`errorRowsAfterResumed` can directly show current errorRows, also at the time of the job's state is changed to Paused.  It can't just use the variable called `currentErrorRows`, cuz `currentErrorRows` will be reset to `0` after the job's state changed.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality) #6091 \r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [ ] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have created an issue on (Fix #ISSUE) and described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [x ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] If these changes need document changes, I have updated the document\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at dev@doris.apache.org by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n","created_at":"2021-06-24T10:37:38Z","updated_at":"2021-07-17T02:44:00Z","closed_at":"2021-07-17T02:44:00Z","merged_at":"2021-07-17T02:44:00Z","merge_commit_sha":"e39e1571ecdbe907fc755c01c268784c64c2377b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":665965628,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2NjU5NjU2Mjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/kind/improvement","name":"kind/improvement","color":"84b6eb","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1127326390,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTI3MzI2Mzkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/good%20first%20issue","name":"good

Proposed changes\r\nThis PR mainly adds a rewrite rule 'ExtractCommonFactorsRule'\r\n  used to extract wide common factors in the planning stage for 'Expr'.\r\nThe main purpose of this rule is to extract (Range or In) expressions\r\n  that can be combined from each or clause.\r\nE.g:\r\n  Origin expr: (1<a<3 and b in ('a') ) or (2<a<4 and b in ('b'))\r\n  Rewritten expr: (1<a<4 ) and (b in ('a', 'b')) and ((1<a<3 and b in ('a') ) or (2<a<4 and b in ('b')))\r\nAlthough the range of the wide common factors is larger than the real range,\r\n  the wide common factors only involve a single column, so it can be pushed down to the scan node,\r\n  thereby reducing the amount of scanned data in advance and improving the query speed.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that this optimization strategy is not for all scenarios.\r\nWhen filter rate of the wide common factor is too low,\r\n  the query will consume an extra time to calculate the wide common factors.\r\n\r\nSo this strategy can be switched by configuring session variables 'extract_wide_range_expr'.\r\nThe default policy is enabled which means this strategy takes effect.\r\nIf you encounter unsatisfactory filtering rate, you can set the variable to false.\r\nIt will turn off the strategy.\r\n\r\nFixed #6082\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDuring stream load, tablet writer write failed in Executor BE would cancel load process, but sometimes detailed error message is missing when client receive stream load result (Not every time).\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"TxnId\": 36148,\r\n    \"Label\": \"1623907022-615\",\r\n    \"Status\": \"Fail\",\r\n    \"Message\": \"add row failed. ; \",\r\n    \"NumberTotalRows\": 0,\r\n    \"NumberLoadedRows\": 0,\r\n    \"NumberFilteredRows\": 0,\r\n    \"NumberUnselectedRows\": 0,\r\n    \"LoadBytes\": 446611,\r\n    \"LoadTimeMs\": 7,\r\n    \"BeginTxnTimeMs\": 0,\r\n    \"StreamLoadPutTimeMs\": 0,\r\n    \"ReadDataTimeMs\": 0,\r\n    \"WriteDataTimeMs\": 5,\r\n    \"CommitAndPublishTimeMs\": 0\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe correct result should be as follows:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"TxnId\": 36149,\r\n    \"Label\": \"1623907037-780\",\r\n    \"Status\": \"Fail\",\r\n    \"Message\": \"add row failed.

Otherwise, `_cancel_msg` may be a empty string when it is returned to client.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nMemory is allocated from MemPool, need to investigate the repercussions.\r\n\r\nIn the past, there were malloc'd and MemPool memory allocation methods. Malloc'd memory belongs to RowBatch itself, and the latter belongs to MemPool management. The memory ownership depends on whether legacy joins and aggs are enabled.\r\n\r\nAt present, it is uniformly allocated from MemPool, and tuple pointers are not transferred and do not have to be re-created in every Reset(), which has better performance.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [x] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I have created an issue on (Fix #6037) and described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nneed to investigate the

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nPrune OlapScanNode's conjuncts according the tablets to be scanned, it only support prune InPredicate.\r\n\r\n### Details\r\n\r\nSuppose there is a table named `table_a`, `table_a`'s distribution column is `k1`, bucket num is 2. `tablet_0` contains data with `k1 in (0, 2)`, `tablet_1` contains data with `k1 in (1, 3)`.\r\n\r\nwhen executing the following query: `select * from table_a where k1 in (0, 1, 2, 3)`. Suppose there are two OlapScanNode in the execution plan, `scan_node_0` and `scan_node_1` are responsible for scanning `tablet_0` and `tablet_1` respectively. Then each sacn_node's conjuncts are `k1 in (0, 1, 2, 3)`.\r\n\r\nHowever, considering the situation of the tablets scanned by OlapScanNode, it is actually possible to prune the InPredicate of the `scan_node_0` to `k1 in (0, 2)` and the InPredicate of the `scan_node_1` to `k1 in (1, 3)`.\r\n\r\nBy prune InPredicate, we can reduce the number of ScanKeys in OlapScanNode and improve the performance of data scanning, especially when InPredicate contains a large number of elements.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] New

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nThe Fragment where OlapScanNode is located has two data distribution possibilities.\r\n1. RANDOM: Involving multi-partitioned tables in OlapScanNode.\r\n2.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nCurrently, Doris only supports export data with CSV format. This PR extends the feature to support parquet format.\r\n\r\nUsage:\r\n\r\nfor export to local file:\r\n\r\n`export table table2 to \"file:///root/doris/\" properties (\"format\"=\"parquet\", \"schema\"=\"required, int64, date; required, int32, siteid; required, int32, citycode; required, byte_array, username; required, int64, pv;\", \"parquet.version\"=\"v2\");`\r\n\r\nIf `format` is `parquet`,  then `schema` is required\r\n\r\nfor export to remote file:\r\n\r\n`export table table2 to \"hdfs://host/test_sql_prc_2019_02_19/\" PROPERTIES (\"schema\"=\"required,int32,siteid;required,byte_array,varchar_test\", \"schema\"=\"required, int64, date; required, int32, siteid; required, int32, citycode; required, byte_array, username; required, int64, pv;\", \"parquet.version\"=\"v2\") with broker hdfs_broker (\"hadoop.security.authentication\" = \"kerberos\",     \"kerberos_principal\" = \"account\",     \"kerberos_keytab_content\" = \"base64\");`\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [ ] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have created an issue on (Fix #ISSUE) and described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [x] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [x] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [x] If these changes need document changes, I have updated the document\r\n- [x] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at dev@doris.apache.org by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n","created_at":"2021-06-15T02:09:24Z","updated_at":"2022-06-21T02:46:31Z","closed_at":"2022-06-21T02:46:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"13ca0a73faae2743de15abc6c7baff8de1b5e1d3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1099563192,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDk5NTYzMTky","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/kind/feature","name":"kind/feature","color":"c7def8","default":false,"description":"Categorizes

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nWhen user create a table, since they may not known the data scale at the first, so they may choose a unsuitable bucket num. When add new partition later, they may use new bucket num, if we can change the default bucket num of a table after creation, then user will do not need to specify bucket num exactly when add new partition.\r\n\r\nSo we can add a sql statement `alter table t modify distribution distributed by hash(column) buckets n;` to modify the default bucket num of table t to `n`.\r\n\r\nFix #6024 \r\n\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [ ] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nQueryDetail is used to statistic the current query details.\r\nThis property will only be set when the query starts to execute.\r\nSo in the query planning stage, using this attribute in the first query will cause 'NullPointerException'.\r\nAfter that, this attribute retains the value of the previous query\r\n  until it is updated by the subsequent process.\r\nBecause code of 'colocateagg' uses this attribute incorrectly in its planning,\r\n  it causes 'NullPointerException' when clients like pymysql connect to doris and send the first query.\r\nFixed #6017\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [ ] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nSelectStmt use new TableName(null, tableRef.getAlias()) to expand star expression. tableRef.getAlias() is full name include database name and table name.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nTo avoid showing too many memtracker on BE web pages.\r\nThe MemTracker level now has 3 levels: OVERVIEW, TASK and VERBOSE.\r\n\r\nOVERVIEW Mainly used for main memory consumption module such as Query/Load/Metadata.\r\nTASK is mainly used to record the memory overhead of a single task such as a single query, load, and compaction task.\r\nVERBOSE is used for other more detailed memtrackers.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [ ] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have created an issue on (Fix #ISSUE) and described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] If these changes need document changes, I have updated the document\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at dev@doris.apache.org
