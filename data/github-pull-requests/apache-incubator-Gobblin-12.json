Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1154\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nVariety of improvements to GaaS error returning:\r\n\r\n- When creating flowConfig, in case of error throw it instead of returning 4xx along with flowConfig. Returning the `CreateKVResponse` means that the the status is only seen if using `--verbose`, and there is no clear error message\r\n- Similarly return a more clear error message when calling get for a flowExecution that doesn't exist\r\n- Instead of concatenating execution links in the message field of flowStatus (this is not useful since they are already in the jobStatus list), use the message field to return a flow level error message\r\n- Added a `FlowCancelled` event so that flows that were SLA killed or manually killed will have a `CANCELLED` status instead of `FAILED`\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1153\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nThe changes in PR 2967 introduce a backward incompatible behavior in metric reporting failures where in: Failure in instantiating one of the configured reporters, fails the entire reporting service. Previously, individual reporter failures are swallowed allowing the rest of the reporting service to proceed. The behavior introduced is PR 2967 may be too aggressive and might need a re-think.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nExisting unit tests.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1147\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nSince the rename with overwrite option method in FileSystem is exposed as protected, so I created a FileSyatemAdapter in the package org.apache.hadoop.fs to call it and expose it as public method.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nTest in pipeline that the rename can succeed\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1129\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nProblem: During the avro2orc conversion, many staging tables are created, they are not cleaned up due to the pipeline failure, and next execution doesn't take care of the clean up, which caused the staging table taking many spaces left in hive meta store.\r\n\r\nSolution: Add the staging table cleaning logic in the dataset discovery phase. When a dataset is found, it will also look at the corresponding staging table pattern, and drop all of those staging tables if exists.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n   Added ConvertibleHiveDatasetFinderTest unit test.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1126\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThe contribution of this PR contains: \r\n- Refactored `upConvertOrcStruct` which was used specifically for handling schema evolution. The downside of the original implementation is, it creates new OrcStruct for each map call which is usually considered as an anti-pattern in MR execution. The fix makes it possible to reuse the same `OrcStruct` object by making this method only generating side-effect but return void. \r\n- The refactored `upConvertOrcStruct` can be reused in column projection of `OrcStruct` so that if we want to have an arbitrary subset of columns to form a shuffle key (we used to use the whole record for shuffle key which is unnecessarily burdensome and harm the performance). \r\n- To accommodate with tests I created a bunch of tools in `OrcUtils`: \r\n-- `orcStructFillerWithFixedValue`: Given a schema, generate a `OrcStruct` with some value. This would be useful to randomly generate some record in row-manner and we could write them into a ORC file easily. \r\n-- `writableComparableTypeWidening`: The original `upConvertOrcStruct` cannot handle this. Added for correctness. \r\n-- `createValueRecursively`: The ORC API to create a `OrcStruct`, `OrcStruct.createValue` has a problem: If there's nested type within a contain-type like List/MAP, `createValue` call doesn't create any instance within the container, so that any nested-type information within the container's element type is lost. It might be worthwhile to contribute this back to ORC upstream. \r\n\r\nThe test might be hard to read, but given all the tools mentioned above, what I really do is mostly following this sequence: \r\n\r\n1. create a ORC schema by: `schema = TypeDescription.createFromString(schemaString);` \r\n2. create a OrcStruct by `orcStruct = OrcUtils.createValueRecursively(schema)`. \r\n3. Fill in the value by `OrcUtils.orcStructFillerWithFixedValue(orcStruct, schema, valueForDifferntTypes ...)` \r\n4. Do this for two different schema: writer schema and reader schema with certain evolution. \r\n5. `upConvertOrcStruct(recordInWriterSchema, recordInReaderSchema, readerSchema); `\r\n6. Examine if `recordInReaderSchema`'s result is expected. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

This fix is to enable close-on-flush semantics for err-file and add unit test for that. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n-  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/[GOBBLIN-1117]\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThis PR fixed the hard-code suffix as \"avro\" in `InputRecordCountHelper` and add a unit test for re-compaction in ORC. \r\n\r\nThere's formatting happening unfortunately in `CompactionThresholdVerifier.java` which might make review a little bit hard. But the only useful line out there is line 89 to check if `newCount` is larger than the `oldCount`. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2020-04-14T21:53:54Z","updated_at":"2020-04-16T23:06:06Z","closed_at":"2020-04-16T23:06:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5d6fd2059976f7b6e11dc7b251f2cc36d511a77e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/2957/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/2957/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/2957/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/9f926bf141c3b1c625b7c8df995bd461592c8205","head":{"label":"autumnust:orc-recompact-fix","ref":"orc-recompact-fix","sha":"9f926bf141c3b1c625b7c8df995bd461592c8205","user":{"login":"autumnust","id":5044213,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDQyMTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5044213?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/autumnust","html_url":"https://github.com/autumnust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autumnust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autumnust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autumnust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autumnust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autumnust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autumnust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autumnust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autumnust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autumnust/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":60211282,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MDIxMTI4Mg==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"autumnust/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"autumnust","id":5044213,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDQyMTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5044213?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/autumnust","html_url":"https://github.com/autumnust","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autumnust/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autumnust/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autumnust/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autumnust/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autumnust/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autumnust/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autumnust/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autumnust/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autumnust/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/autumnust/gobblin","description":"Universal

initialization from cluster workers\r\n\r\nDear Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1116\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nThis PR avoids having to register schema with schema registry on Kafka metric reporter initialization from cluster workers. This avoids a potentially large number of connections that may be initiated with Kafka Schema registry on Gobblin on Yarn application launch. \r\n\r\nIn addition, this PR cleans up existing code in SchemaRegistryVersionWriter and Kafka reporters, and refactors existing unit tests. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nThis PR adds new unit tests for each of the metric reporter types. In addition, we add a new unit test in GobblinYarnAppLauncherTest.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2020-04-14T05:45:41Z","updated_at":"2020-04-17T21:36:44Z","closed_at":"2020-04-17T21:36:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"744f5dffaaf28bedcb6b895ef6850938e02a5ac8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/2956/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/2956/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/2956/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/a92ec28f371142bb90edd2fca04af4ae8132a534","head":{"label":"sv2000:metricsReporterFailure","ref":"metricsReporterFailure","sha":"a92ec28f371142bb90edd2fca04af4ae8132a534","user":{"login":"sv2000","id":6979567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5Nzk1Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6979567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000","html_url":"https://github.com/sv2000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":110619744,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTA2MTk3NDQ=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"sv2000/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sv2000","id":6979567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5Nzk1Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6979567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000","html_url":"https://github.com/sv2000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sv2000/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sv2000/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1107\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nCurrent behavior eagerly initializes the taskStateModelFactory inside the constructor. This causes Helix task assignment to be stuck when a Helix manager connection needs to be retried.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nExisting unit tests.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

JIRA\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1101\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n1. ExceedQuota exception\r\nIf the ExceedQuota exception happens, we should let the thread sleep 5 minutes and try again. There should not be a retryLimit for this exception.\r\n2. Except stack in log file\r\nFor example we set up retryLimit to 10, we retried 10 times,  and failed; we need to print out exception stack in log file, there are 10 of them in the exception stack.

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1100\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nThe KafkaExtractor close method only calls the KafkaExtractorStatsTracker#emitTrackingEvents method when metrics instrumentation is enabled. This method calls KafkaExtractorStatsTracker#generateTagsForPartitions, which has the side effect of setting the average fetch time in the WorkUnitState. The average fetch time is required for the work unit packing to pack optimally.\r\n\r\nAdd a call to KafkaExtractorStatsTracker#generateTagsForPartitions in KafkaExtractor#close when metrics instrumentation is disabled to restore the behavior that existed prior to the KafkaExtractorStatsTracker refactoring.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nKafkaExtractorStatsTrackerTest\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1099\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nA Yarn application may leave behind orphaned containers, which can happen due to lost node managers. The orphaned containers however can continue to run (potentially forever) as participants in the Helix cluster. This can cause the following problems for a Gobblin-on-Yarn application:\r\n\r\nDouble publish of data and commit of state\r\nTask failures and partition starvation during application restarts, as Helix may assign tasks to the orphaned containers which have a stale state and configuration\r\nContainer failures on application restarts due to Helix instance name collisions with orphaned containers\r\n\r\nThis PR incorporates the following changes to handle orphaned containers:\r\n1. Disables live instances during Yarn application start up and shutdown in GobblinYarnAppLauncher. This ensures that any orphaned Helix instances are disabled from joining the cluster on restart and any tasks running on these instances are cancelled.\r\n2. The GobblinApplicationMaster (inside YarnService) ensures that Helix instance name assigned to a newly allocated container is not a currently live instance to avoid instance name collisions. We also handle NM failures/restarts that result in Yarn RM \"aborting\" the container (i.e. container is deemed dead from Yarn's point of view, even though the container may physically be alive). In this case, we disable the instance to ensure it is fenced off from the Helix cluster.\r\n3. Gobblin workers (i.e. GobblinYarnTaskRunner) retry in case of failure in joining a Helix cluster. The retry logic disconnects from the Helix cluster and drops the instance before reattempting to join the cluster. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nAdded unit test in GobblinTaskRunnerTest\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1098\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nThe commons-lang and slf4j are commonly used dependencies and are likely to result in conflicts when included in a fat jar without shading. Remove these dependencies from the orc-dep fat jar to avoid conflicts.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nBuilt and tested with the new fat jar.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

Kafka pipeline\r\n\r\nDear Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1087\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nIn this PR, we instrument the KafkaExtractor to track the observed latency of Kafka consumer records processed by the pipeline. Here, observed latency is measured as the time difference between processing time of the record and the original creation time. The latency distribution is tracked in an HdrHistogram, which is serialized into a string when emitted as part of a GobblinTrackingEvent.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nAdded unit tests and a JMH benchmarking test.\r\n\r\nSample results from running micro-benchmarks on a Macbook with a 3.5GHz Dual core Intel Core i7:\r\nEstimated memory footprint of histogram is: 147968\r\n\r\nBenchmark                                                             Mode  Cnt  Score    Error  Units\r\nHdrHistogramPerformanceBenchmark.trackBuildHistogram                  avgt   10  0.007 ±  0.001  ms/op\r\nHdrHistogramPerformanceBenchmark.trackHistogram10MToStringConversion  avgt   10  1.000 ±  0.054  ms/op\r\nHdrHistogramPerformanceBenchmark.trackHistogram1MToStringConversion   avgt   10  0.930 ±  0.525  ms/op\r\nHdrHistogramPerformanceBenchmark.trackHistogram2MToStringConversion   avgt   10  0.823 ±  0.065  ms/op\r\nHdrHistogramPerformanceBenchmark.trackHistogram4MToStringConversion   avgt   10  0.850 ±  0.037  ms/op\r\nHdrHistogramPerformanceBenchmark.trackMergeHistogram                  avgt   10  0.181 ±  0.028  ms/op\r\nHdrHistogramPerformanceBenchmark.trackResetHistogram                  avgt   10  0.002 ±  0.001  ms/op\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n-  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1083\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThis PR contains several changes: \r\n- To increase the chance of a cancelled task to be re-balanced by Helix, for cancelled task we marked it as \"FAILED\" instead of \"CANCELLED\" in GobblinHelixTask. \r\n- Add a return value of `waitJobCompletion ` to reflect if the job is successfully finished or not. \r\n- In SleepTask, instead of propagating throwable which is not handled properly, we call `failTask` which sets `WorkUnitState.WorkingState.FAILED ` and `ConfigurationKeys.TASK_FAILURE_EXCEPTION_KEY`, the latter will be used to handled propagated exception properly in org.apache.gobblin.runtime.TaskState#setTaskFailureException, so in the test routine it is handy in terms of expected failure handling. The same for `FailedTask`.  Simply put, before the change, we used customized task framework in `SingleTask` for integration test but they don't handle failure case properly. \r\n- Some renaming / documentation. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1078\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThis change is to improving fault-tolerance of Gobblin-on-YARN. \r\n\r\nThe task cancel and task.run is called in different thread from helix side, which introduced problems when: \r\n- Task get cancelled for some reasons from Helix side, therefore calling `SingleTask#cancel `\r\n- However, TaskAttempt object within SingleTask has not been initialized, therefore it didn't pass the non-null checking and only prints a log. After that, the run method in different thread start to run and never get cancelled. \r\n\r\nThis sequence could result in violation of helix quota in each participant: While helix believe there's no partition assigned to a participant and assign a new partition, the previous not-yet-cancelled partition is still running. \r\n\r\nWe added a barrier in cancel method to ensure cancel is blocked if taskAttempt object is not yet being initialized. Added unit test to simulate the sequence as well. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1077\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nIn resolveConfig, we get a config object, and resolve the value and put all of them in a property object without desanitize the key. And when transform the property object back to config, there is a chance to get runTime exception. ( By saying desanitize the key, I mean call the ConfigUtils.desanitizeKey() method, which is basically remove the suffix added when transform property to config)\r\n\r\nSolution: directly construct a config object instead config->property->config\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nUnit test\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1072\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis change is for improving fault tolerance of Gobblin-on-YARN. \r\n\r\n- An additional data structure `MaxValueEvictingQueue` to wrap multiple instances of `numTargetContainers` and behaved like an sliding-window where we could fetch the maxValue in the sliding-window in constant time. \r\n- The advantage of this data structure is, if there's fluctuation in the number of active Helix partitions, a single fluctuation wont't impact the number of containers we requested in `YarnService`. \r\n- The sliding-window's size is defined by the number of attempts that we query Helix for getting partitions number. \r\n- Use a different way to tag an instance as \"unused\" : Currently whenever we found an instance with no Helix partition assigned to it when inspecting, we tag it as \"unused\" and tell YarnService it could be a candidate for scaling down. To make it less aggressive, we maintain a map with Helix instance as the Key and the \"lastIdleTime\" as the value, when currentTime - lastIdleTime is beyond tolerance, we then tag this instance as unused. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nTested in the internal YARN cluster.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1071\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThis change is for improving fault tolerance of Gobblin-on-YARN\r\n\r\nThe major part of this PR are: \r\n- In `GobblinMultiTaskAttempt.java`, created a method `createTaskWithRetry`  to wrap around `createTaskRunnable`, so that the task-initialization as part of `createTaskRunnable`  could be retried. The retry-component is built using `Retryer` library which essentially uses guava's retry library. To make that easier, also added some features in `RetryerFactory.java`, especially attempt-based retry to better fit our requirement here. This part is tested within `TaskErrorIntegrationTest.java ` where sits a method `extractorCreationError`. We created a test case for `extractorCreationErrorWithRetry` to demonstrate retry case. \r\n- In `GobblinHelixTask` also introduced retry of calling `SingleTask`'s constructor in the same approach. The relevant testing is in `GobblinHelixTaskTest.java` where we fail the constructor call on purpose and since we cannot easily heal the failure, it results in a retry-failure at the end. \r\n\r\nThis PR also contains many renaming for refactoring as I went through the code base. Most of the rename is because the original name is far from being accurate. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1068\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nThis change is for improving fault-tolerance of Gobblin-on-YARN\r\n\r\nThe original `cancel` method in `Task.java` has several problems: \r\n--`Task` is an implementation of `Runable` while itself contains a reference of `Future<?>` which is the handler of the `Runnable` after being submitted. The life-cycle of the `Runnable` shouldn't be controlled by itself as it looks like right now, but should be the `TaskExecutor` or something externally. \r\n-- Because of the existence of a `Future<?>`  object within Task, there's a bug in the implementation: The extension of `Task`, which is `TaskIFaceWrapper` doesn't have the constructor to initialize this variable, while one of the public method(`completeShutdown` within `cancel`) is exposing the accessing of this variable. This is a bug and the original fix in this PR:https://github.com/apache/incubator-gobblin/pull/2157/files is doing wrong thing to copy the base class's method and remove the calling of `completeShutdown`. In fact, the future object doesn't have to be existed in the first place. \r\n-- Fixing some other typos, and unit test problems as well. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1066\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR:\r\n- `AvroProjectionConverter` currently ignores extract namespace to identify fields to remove for a table. The change is to identify fields to remove with namespace into account, configurable. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests:\r\n- `AvroProjectionConverterTest.testRemoveWithNamespace` verifies that fields are only removed if key `<namespace>.<table name>.remove.fields`, which is `db1.table1.remove.fields` in this test, is present.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-1058\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nTo make it easier for caller of `KafkaExtractorStatsTracker#emitTrackingEvents` to add additional tags in to metric map, adding another method with `additionalTag` as an argument. We don't choose to make `createTagsForPartition` extensible since it seems wasty to create more derived classes only with the purpose of adding more k-v pairs into an event for monitoring purpose. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not
