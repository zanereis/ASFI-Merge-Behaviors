What is this PR for?\r\nAdds an interface (UserLookup) that a realm can implement to support looking up users and roles.  This makes it easier to implement a Realm and allows Zeppelin to ask the configured realms for user and role information without having to know which implementation of Realm that it is interacting with.  The pre-exising lookup code that was contained in GetUserList.java has been moved into the Realm implementations. \r\nThis PR includes a change to SecurityUtils to allow it to get the Roles of the currently authenticated user regardless of Realm used.  \r\nThis PR also includes an endpoint /xlogin to make it easier to configure shiro to work with indirect authorization (eXternal login) like OAuth or OpenID through buji-pac4j.  \r\nThis PR expands the shiro security coverage to the entire application (/*).  It previously only covered /api/*. \r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nImprovement\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [ ] - \r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n[ZEPPELIN-2636] - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2636\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\nConfigure shiro.ini to use the various realms (Ini, Jdbc, Pam, etc).  Verify that the user and role lookup functionality used for notebook sharing still works.  I've been checking /api/security/userlist/<searchtext>\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? No\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions?  using the stock shiro JdbcRealm, you won't be able to lookup users and roles... Transition to org.apache.zeppelin.realms.JdbcRealm.  \r\n* Does this needs documentation?

What is this PR for?\r\nThe user is no more on Zeppelin UI Login page after clicking logout button or links where user doesn't have access to when Zeppelin is running behind a proxy server like Nginx.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Bug Fix]\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* [ZEPPELIN-2601](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2601)\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\nSet up any reverse proxy server like Nginx, exmaple config below;\r\n\r\n```\r\nlocation /abc/def/zeppelin/ {\r\n        proxy_pass http://localhost:8080/;\r\n        proxy_http_version 1.1;\r\n        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;\r\n        proxy_set_header Connection \"upgrade\";\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd now from browser navigate to this URL, and click on any like for which user doesn't have access to. In my example `user1` did not have access to any of `/api/interpreter/**` `/api/configurations/**` and `/api/credential/**`\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if

documentation?\r\n","created_at":"2017-05-30T08:19:09Z","updated_at":"2022-05-02T16:26:11Z","closed_at":"2017-06-06T15:01:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"482378783f51d6c450f728d16f4228496d6c5f12","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/2377/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/2377/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/2377/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/d5c6af20884caecc891b29654fb59ff2aa80c5bb","head":{"label":"prabhjyotsingh:ZEPPELIN-2601","ref":"ZEPPELIN-2601","sha":"d5c6af20884caecc891b29654fb59ff2aa80c5bb","user":{"login":"prabhjyotsingh","id":674497,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NDQ5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/674497?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh","html_url":"https://github.com/prabhjyotsingh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44664903,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDY2NDkwMw==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"prabhjyotsingh/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"prabhjyotsingh","id":674497,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NDQ5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/674497?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh","html_url":"https://github.com/prabhjyotsingh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prabhjyotsingh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/prabhjyotsingh/zeppelin","description":"Mirror

What is this PR for?\r\nCurrently allowing authentication for selected roles/groups of an LDAP realm is not possible. The LDAPRealm allows for mapping of roles to groups but only allows authorization on URLs with respect to groups. No group based checks are carried out during authentication. This PR allows for group based authentication using LdapRealm.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Improvement]\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [x] - Merge #932 - This PR also merges changes from 932 so that needs to be merged first.\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2539\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\nBuild and configure `shiro.ini` to use the LdapRealm and verify that the realm works as before along with the added functionality of allowing only certain user groups for authentication if the `allowedRolesForAuthentication` config is set in the init. If this configuration is absent authentication should work as before without verifying roles. A sample shiro.ini is pasted here for testing purposes.\r\n\r\n```\r\n[main]\r\nldapRealm = org.apache.zeppelin.realm.LdapRealm\r\nldapRealm.userDnTemplate = uid={0},ou=people,dc=my-company,dc=net\r\nldapRealm.searchBase = dc=my-company,dc=net\r\nldapRealm.userSearchBase = ou=people,dc=my-company,dc=net\r\nldapRealm.groupSearchBase = ou=groups,dc=my-company,dc=net\r\nldapRealm.contextFactory.url = ldaps://auth.my-company.net:636\r\nldapRealm.contextFactory.authenticationMechanism = simple\r\nldapRealm.userObjectClass = posixAccount\r\nldapRealm.groupObjectClass = posixGroup\r\nldapRealm.authorizationEnabled = true\r\nldapRealm.memberAttribute = memberUid\r\nldapRealm.memberAttributeValueTemplate=uid={0},ou=people,dc=my-company,dc=net\r\nldapRealm.rolesByGroup = GLOBAL_ADMINS:admin,HKG_USERS:user\r\nldapRealm.allowedRolesForAuthentication = admin,user\r\nldapRealm.userSearchAttributeName = uid\r\nsessionManager = org.apache.shiro.web.session.mgt.DefaultWebSessionManager\r\nshiro.loginUrl = /api/login\r\nsecurityManager.sessionManager = $sessionManager\r\nsecurityManager.sessionManager.globalSessionTimeout = 86400000\r\nsecurityManager.realms = $ldapRealm\r\n\r\n[urls]\r\n/api/version = anon\r\n/api/login = authc\r\n/api/login/logout = authc\r\n/** = authc, roles[admin,user]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? No\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\r\n* Does this needs documentation?

PR)\r\n","created_at":"2017-05-19T13:43:03Z","updated_at":"2017-06-08T08:35:18Z","closed_at":"2017-06-07T18:00:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bfc6ad3ec3480591cfff83e93efceb873ce21281","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/2354/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/2354/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/2354/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/f706b22298f91c0ce3cd47b8c31349cf8024bcc9","head":{"label":"sohaibiftikhar:ldaprealm","ref":"ldaprealm","sha":"f706b22298f91c0ce3cd47b8c31349cf8024bcc9","user":{"login":"sohaibiftikhar","id":5103613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMDM2MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5103613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohaibiftikhar","html_url":"https://github.com/sohaibiftikhar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohaibiftikhar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohaibiftikhar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohaibiftikhar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohaibiftikhar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohaibiftikhar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohaibiftikhar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohaibiftikhar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohaibiftikhar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohaibiftikhar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":89696361,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4OTY5NjM2MQ==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"sohaibiftikhar/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sohaibiftikhar","id":5103613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMDM2MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5103613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohaibiftikhar","html_url":"https://github.com/sohaibiftikhar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohaibiftikhar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohaibiftikhar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohaibiftikhar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohaibiftikhar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohaibiftikhar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohaibiftikhar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohaibiftikhar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohaibiftikhar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sohaibiftikhar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sohaibiftikhar/zeppelin","description":"Mirror

What is this PR for?\r\nBasically what happens is, if a user login using full name with suffix then the user impersonation fails, as the HDFS expects username without the suffix.\r\nThis is because the username is passed to underlying components with suffix and got rejected in security layer with IllegalArgumentException\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Bug Fix]\r\n\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* [ZEPPELIN-2530](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2530)\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n - Enable AD authentication \r\n - set `activeDirectoryRealm.principalSuffix` in shiro.ini\r\n - now try to login with the full user name (in my example its zepplin@testdomain.com)\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if

What is this PR for ?\r\nThis PR replaces the PR-1479 by removing any hadoop dependency using WEBHDFS as a communication protocol (code borrowed from PR1600)\r\nZeppelin currently supports many backends for storing notes through Apache Commons VFS.\r\nApache Commons VFS supports HDFS in readonly mode.\r\nThis PR makes HDFS a first class citizen by allowing users to load notes from / save notes to HDFS.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n\r\n### Improvement\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n\r\n### Task\r\nWhat is the Jira issue?\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1515\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n\r\nUpdate zeppelin.notebook.dir property to a value like hdfs://localhost:9000/tmp/notebook and the property zeppelin.notebook.storage to the value org.apache.zeppelin.notebook.repo.HdfsNotebookRepo\r\n\r\ncheck that your notes are loaded from and stored to HDFS by listing notes using the command :\r\nhdfs dfs -ls /tmp/notebook\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? No\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\r\n* Does this needs documentation? Yes\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-05-10T13:11:32Z","updated_at":"2018-01-16T10:41:49Z","closed_at":"2018-01-16T10:41:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"52d450aae039e947ba5501dd5644064acc8367a7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/2333/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/2333/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/2333/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/b8d9d0b2c821314baeef2c3d6005c394dbe42d91","head":{"label":"ebiznext:WEBHDFS","ref":"WEBHDFS","sha":"b8d9d0b2c821314baeef2c3d6005c394dbe42d91","user":{"login":"ebiznext","id":2474000,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjI0NzQwMDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2474000?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebiznext","html_url":"https://github.com/ebiznext","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebiznext/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebiznext/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebiznext/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebiznext/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebiznext/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebiznext/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebiznext/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebiznext/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebiznext/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":90864142,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5MDg2NDE0Mg==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"ebiznext/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ebiznext","id":2474000,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjI0NzQwMDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2474000?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebiznext","html_url":"https://github.com/ebiznext","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebiznext/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebiznext/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebiznext/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebiznext/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebiznext/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebiznext/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebiznext/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebiznext/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ebiznext/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ebiznext/zeppelin","description":"Mirror

What is this PR for?\r\n\r\nDON'T set bottom margin for the markdown table.\r\n\r\n#### Implementation Details\r\n\r\nthat's because `.paragraph table` overwrites `.markdown-body

[x] - Bump version up from 2.4.0 to 2.6.0\r\n* [x] - Update `bin_license/LICENSE`\r\n* [x] - Import it using commonjs\r\n* [x] - Fix paragraph.css \r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n\r\n[ZEPPELIN-2520](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2520)\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n\r\n1. Build: `mvn clean package -DskipTests;`\r\n2. Execute a paragraph using this text.\r\n\r\n```md\r\nColons can be used to align columns.\r\n\r\n| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |\r\n| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|\r\n| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |\r\n| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |\r\n| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |\r\n\r\nThere must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.\r\nThe outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the \r\nraw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.\r\n\r\nMarkdown | Less | Pretty\r\n--- | --- | ---\r\n*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**\r\n1 | 2 | 3\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n####

What is this PR for?\r\n`Visualization` class should throw an error if an abstract method is not implemented just like [`SpellBase`](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/zeppelin-web/src/app/spell/spell-base.js#L25) does.\r\n\r\nAnd I added some comments. In my opinion, though `Visualization` has [a good example](http://zeppelin.apache.org/docs/0.8.0-SNAPSHOT/development/writingzeppelinvisualization.html), it needs an API documentation page (`Spell` as well). `Visualization` class has methods which can be overridden (e.g. `refresh`, `destroy`, etc.), but the example doesn't mention them. Therefore, users don't know what and how to implement easily!\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nImprovement\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n[ZEPPELIN-2493](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2493)\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n* Inherit `Visualization`\r\n* Don't implement any abstract method\r\n* Run `getTransformation()` and `render()`\r\n* Check they print appropriate errors\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? NO\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? NO\r\n* Does this needs documentation?
