name is very misleading. I changed the name and moved some elements to other places. I am happy because now the _run_scheduler_loop method calls only harvest_simple_dags for processor_agent in happy path.  The processor_agent and executor starts and stops in one method.

`stdout` and `stderr` are captured during Task execution to allow handling by custom log writers. While this is great, there are cases where forwarding task execution output to system streams (console) during task runtime is advantageous (ie for capture by docker logging drivers). Adding a `LogHandler` that wrote to stdout or stderr would result in an infinite loop of message forwarding `stdout > StreamLogWriter > logger > stdout > StreamLogWriter > ...`\r\n\r\nThis adds a configuration flag `['logging']['task_log_to_console']` which enables forwarding of task stream messages to the console when set. This is implemented via a new context manager that adds existing system stream targets as targets for the `StreamLogWriter`. There is some implementation of log target replacement that is essentially duplicated from the stdlib, but I could not think of a better way to do this without a subclassing death-spiral. It has decent tests, and I do not think that this will be difficult to keep unbroken.\r\n\r\n---\r\nIssue link: [AIRFLOW-7065](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-7065)\r\n\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before creating PR: [x]\r\n\r\n- [x] Description above provides context of the change\r\n- [x] Commit message/PR title starts with `[AIRFLOW-NNNN]`.
