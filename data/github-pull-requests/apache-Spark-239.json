If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFirst, we have to admit that we can't stop users to use a custom v2 catalog and completely bypass the spark session catalog. But we don't expect users to do so as this can bring many problems:\r\n1. `CREATE TABLE t1 USING v1Source` and `CREATE TABLE t2 USING v2Source` will create table entries in 2 different catalogs(session catalog and custom catalog).\r\n2. not able to describe the table in the session catalog.\r\n3.

PR takes over #19788. After we split the shuffle fetch protocol from `OpenBlock` in #24565, this optimization can be extended in the new shuffle protocol. Credit to @yucai, closes #19788.\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR adds the support for continuous shuffle block fetching in batch:\r\n\r\n- Shuffle client changes:\r\n    - Add new feature tag `spark.shuffle.fetchContinuousBlocksInBatch`, implement the decision logic in `BlockStoreShuffleReader`.\r\n    - Merge the continuous shuffle block ids in batch if needed in ShuffleBlockFetcherIterator.\r\n- Shuffle server changes:\r\n    - Add support in `ExternalBlockHandler` for the external shuffle service side.\r\n    - Make `ShuffleBlockResolver.getBlockData` accept getting block data by range.\r\n- Protocol changes:\r\n    - Add new block id type `ShuffleBlockBatchId` represent continuous shuffle block ids.\r\n    - Extend `FetchShuffleBlocks` and `OneForOneBlockFetcher`.\r\n    - After the new shuffle fetch protocol completed in #24565, the backward compatibility for external shuffle service can be controlled by `spark.shuffle.useOldFetchProtocol`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn adaptive execution, one reducer may fetch multiple continuous shuffle blocks from one map output file. However, as the original approach, each reducer needs to fetch those 10 reducer blocks one by one. This way needs many IO and impacts performance. This PR is to support fetching those continuous shuffle blocks in one IO (batch way). See below example:\r\n\r\nThe shuffle block is stored like below:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2989575/51654634-c37fbd80-1fd3-11e9-935e-5652863676c3.png)\r\nThe ShuffleId format is s\"shuffle_$shuffleId_$mapId_$reduceId\", referring to BlockId.scala.\r\n\r\nIn adaptive execution, one reducer may want to read output for reducer 5 to 14, whose block Ids are from shuffle_0_x_5 to shuffle_0_x_14.\r\nBefore this PR, Spark needs 10 disk IOs + 10 network IOs for each output file.\r\nAfter this PR, Spark only needs 1 disk IO and 1 network IO. This way can reduce IO dramatically.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd new UT.\r\nIntegrate test with setting `spark.sql.adaptive.enabled=true`.","created_at":"2019-10-07T05:32:17Z","updated_at":"2019-10-17T10:39:36Z","closed_at":"2019-10-17T06:48:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2c0ef412d2e811de4a6edb905e70e928b16d46d9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

tested\r\n\r\nBefore patch:\r\n```\r\n>>> cvModel.write().save(\"/tmp/model_0\")\r\n>>> cvModel2 = CrossValidatorModel.read().load(\"/tmp/model_0\")\r\n>>> print(cvModel2.avgMetrics)\r\n[]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter patch:\r\n```\r\n>>> cvModel2 = CrossValidatorModel.read().load(\"/tmp/model_2\")\r\n>>>

Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe current docker image used by Kubernetes is `openjdk:8-alpine`. It was not supported and  was removed with the commit https://github.com/docker-library/openjdk/commit/3eb0351b208d739fac35345c85e3c6237c2114ec#diff-f95ffa3d1377774732c33f7b8368e099.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to move to a supported docker image.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI think there are at least two reasons:\r\n\r\n1. According to the commit, Alpine/musl is not officially supported by the OpenJDK project.\r\n2. As no more OpenJDK 8 Alpine images, new JDK updates including security fixes\r\n, are not applied to it. See below:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndocker run -it --rm openjdk:8-alpine java -version\r\nopenjdk version \"1.8.0_212\"\r\nOpenJDK Runtime Environment (IcedTea 3.12.0) (Alpine 8.212.04-r0)\r\nOpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.212-b04, mixed mode)\r\n```\r\n```\r\ndocker run -it --rm openjdk:8-jdk-slim java -version\r\nopenjdk version \"1.8.0_222\"\r\nOpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_222-b10)\r\nOpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.222-b10, mixed mode)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes. This changes the base docker image of Spark.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdded new rules to `TypeCoercion.DateTimeOperations` for the `Subtract` expression which is replaced by existing `TimestampDiff` expression if one of its parameter has the `DATE` type and another one is the `TIMESTAMP` type. The date argument is casted to timestamp.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n- To maintain feature parity with PostgreSQL which supports subtraction of a date from a timestamp and a timestamp from a date:\r\n```sql\r\nmaxim=# select timestamp'now' - date'epoch';\r\n          ?column?          \r\n----------------------------\r\n 18175 days 21:07:33.412875\r\n(1 row)\r\n\r\nmaxim=# select date'2020-01-01' - timestamp'now';\r\n        ?column?         \r\n-------------------------\r\n 86 days 02:52:00.945296\r\n(1 row)\r\n```\r\n- To conform to the SQL standard which defines datetime subtraction as an interval.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, currently the queries bellow fails with the error:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select timestamp'now' - date'2019-10-01';\r\nError in query: cannot resolve '(TIMESTAMP('2019-10-06 21:05:07.234') - DATE '2019-10-01')' due to data type mismatch: differing types in '(TIMESTAMP('2019-10-06 21:05:07.234') - DATE '2019-10-01')' (timestamp and date).; line 1 pos 7;\r\n'Project [unresolvedalias((1570385107234000 - 18170), None)]\r\n+- OneRowRelation\r\n```\r\nafter the changes:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select timestamp'now' - date'2019-10-01';\r\ninterval 5 days 21 hours 4 minutes 55 seconds 878 milliseconds\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Add new cases to the `rule for date/timestamp operations` test in `TypeCoercionSuite`\r\n- by 2 new test in `datetime.sql`\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-06T18:15:01Z","updated_at":"2020-02-05T18:26:13Z","closed_at":"2019-10-07T07:47:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"dae457aa8434974fef2501104092da34421b4178","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26036/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26036/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26036/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/edfb9b8f36382553ec49ffc1c94dab16c21da66a","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:date-timestamp-subtract","ref":"date-timestamp-subtract","sha":"edfb9b8f36382553ec49ffc1c94dab16c21da66a","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nModified the `DateDiff` expression to return `CalendarIntervalType` according to the SQL standard , see [4.5.3  Operations involving datetimes and intervals](http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~shadow/sql/sql1992.txt). This affects the `datediff` function and dates subtraction. By default, the expression return an integer which is the number of days between dates but when `spark.sql.ansi.enabled` is set to `true` and `spark.sql.dialect` is `Spark`, result type is the `INTERVAL` type. For example:\r\n```sql\r\n> select date'tomorrow' - date'yesterday';\r\ninterval 2 days\r\n```\r\n_Note: I haven't found any DBMS that return an interval for date subtract for now._\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n- To conform the SQL standard which states the result type of `date operand 1` - `date operand 2` must be the interval type.\r\n- Improve Spark SQL UX and allow mixing date and timestamp in subtractions. For example: `select timestamp'now' + (date'2019-10-01' - date'2019-09-15')`\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, when SQL ANSI is enabled in the Spark dialect.\r\nBefore the query below returns number of days:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> SET spark.sql.ansi.enabled=true;\r\nspark.sql.ansi.enabled\ttrue\r\nspark-sql> SET spark.sql.dialect=Spark;\r\nspark.sql.dialect\tSpark\r\nspark-sql> select date'2019-10-05' - date'2018-09-01';\r\n399\r\n```\r\nAfter it returns an interval:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> SET spark.sql.ansi.enabled=true;\r\nspark.sql.ansi.enabled\ttrue\r\nspark-sql> SET spark.sql.dialect=Spark;\r\nspark.sql.dialect\tSpark\r\nspark-sql> select date'2019-10-05' - date'2018-09-01';\r\ninterval 1 years 1 months 4 days\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- by new tests in `DateExpressionsSuite`.\r\n- by examples for `DateDiff` that are checked due to https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/25942

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch provides a new API on creating streaming DataFrame from RDD, which helps to create custom streaming data source in DSv1. This will be the one of interim solutions until new DSv2 has been stabilized and widely adopted.\r\n\r\nJavaRDD is not addressed since `Source` and its relevant interfaces are not Java-friendly.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe new API this patch proposes would help developers to choose DSv1 for streaming source: for now they're stuck between choosing old DSv2 (and have to work for Spark 3.0 again) and new DSv2 (wait for new API to be available - Spark 3.0 - and overcome huge learning curve).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose refactoring of date and timestamp expressions by:\r\n- Moving all timestamp expressions from `datetimeExpressions.scala` to `timestampExpressions.scala`\r\n- Renaming `datetimeExpressions.scala` to `dateExpressions.scala`\r\n- Moving all timestamp expressions tests from `DateExpressionsSuite.scala` to `TimestampExpressionsSuite.scala`.\r\n- Moving all timestamp functions tests to from `DateFunctionsSuite.scala` to `TimestampFunctionsSuite.scala`. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe `datetimeExpressions.scala` file has been becoming large. Its size is more than 2000 lines, at the moment. Also it contains 2 kind of expressions - date expressions and timestamp expressions. To make easier navigation and maintainability of date-time expressions, it would be nice to separate the expressions. The same reason is applicable for timestamp expressions and functions.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy existing tests from the test suite `DateExpressionsSuite` and `TimestampExpressionSuite`, and by new test suites `TimestampExpressionsSuite` and `TimestampFunctionsSuite`.\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-05T07:43:57Z","updated_at":"2019-10-23T07:23:17Z","closed_at":"2019-10-06T19:36:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"665e173ac4324aff290d4a2297cb0abbc4915cbd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26031/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26031/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26031/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/cd713e733b582591dd9805bcc7d372231b3283d5","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:date-time-refactoring","ref":"date-time-refactoring","sha":"cd713e733b582591dd9805bcc7d372231b3283d5","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nReimplement `org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.util.QuantileSummaries#merge` and add a test-case showing the previous bug.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe original Greenwald-Khanna paper, from which the algorithm behind `approxQuantile` was taken, does not cover how to merge the result of multiple parallel QuantileSummaries. The current implementation violates some invariants and therefore the effective error can be larger than the specified.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, for same cases, the results from `approxQuantile` (`percentile_approx` in SQL) will now be within the expected error margin. For example:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nvar values = (1 to 100).toArray\r\nval all_quantiles = values.indices.map(i => (i+1).toDouble / values.length).toArray\r\nfor (n <- 0 until 5) {\r\n  var df = spark.sparkContext.makeRDD(values).toDF(\"value\").repartition(5)\r\n  val all_answers = df.stat.approxQuantile(\"value\", all_quantiles, 0.1)\r\n  val all_answered_ranks = all_answers.map(ans => values.indexOf(ans)).toArray\r\n  val error = all_answered_ranks.zipWithIndex.map({ case (answer, expected) => Math.abs(expected - answer) }).toArray\r\n  val max_error = error.max\r\n  print(max_error + \"\\n\")\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the current build it returns:\r\n\r\n```\r\n16\r\n12\r\n10\r\n11\r\n17\r\n```\r\n\r\nI couldn't run the code with this patch applied to double check the implementation. Can someone please confirm it now outputs at most `10`, please?\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nA new unit test was added to uncover the previous bug.","created_at":"2019-10-04T22:45:58Z","updated_at":"2024-04-12T13:22:48Z","closed_at":"2019-10-08T13:11:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ce020d05f6a6b3de1f1c69e53e6793a014c961b0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26029/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26029/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26029/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/02af468b8c249103e65e97ce0945309e0d48e1a3","head":{"label":"sitegui:SPARK-29336","ref":"SPARK-29336","sha":"02af468b8c249103e65e97ce0945309e0d48e1a3","user":{"login":"sitegui","id":2801575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MDE1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2801575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitegui","html_url":"https://github.com/sitegui","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitegui/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitegui/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitegui/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitegui/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitegui/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitegui/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitegui/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitegui/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitegui/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":212417217,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTI0MTcyMTc=","name":"spark","full_name":"sitegui/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sitegui","id":2801575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MDE1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2801575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitegui","html_url":"https://github.com/sitegui","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitegui/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitegui/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitegui/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitegui/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitegui/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitegui/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitegui/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitegui/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitegui/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sitegui/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR adds 2 changes regarding exception handling in `SQLQueryTestSuite` and `ThriftServerQueryTestSuite`\r\n- fixes an expected output sorting issue in `ThriftServerQueryTestSuite` as if there is an exception then there is no need for sort\r\n- introduces common exception handling in those 2 suites with a new `handleExceptions` method\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently `ThriftServerQueryTestSuite` passes on master, but it fails on one of my PRs (https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/23531) with this error  (https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/SparkPullRequestBuilder/111651/testReport/org.apache.spark.sql.hive.thriftserver/ThriftServerQueryTestSuite/sql_3/):\r\n```\r\norg.scalatest.exceptions.TestFailedException: Expected \"\r\n[Recursion level limit 100 reached but query has not exhausted, try increasing spark.sql.cte.recursion.level.limit\r\norg.apache.spark.SparkException]\r\n\", but got \"\r\n[org.apache.spark.SparkException\r\nRecursion level limit 100 reached but query has not exhausted, try increasing spark.sql.cte.recursion.level.limit]\r\n\" Result did not match for query #4 WITH RECURSIVE r(level) AS (   VALUES (0)   UNION ALL   SELECT level + 1 FROM r ) SELECT * FROM r\r\n```\r\nThe unexpected reversed order of expected output (error message comes first, then the exception class) is due to this line: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/26028/files#diff-b3ea3021602a88056e52bf83d8782de8L146. It should not sort the expected output if there was an error during execution.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting UTs.\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-04T21:01:49Z","updated_at":"2019-10-13T08:15:11Z","closed_at":"2019-10-13T05:17:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"04161f7cfc1fc27855c22294947a95c820b55904","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406606402,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA2NDAy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/TESTS","name":"TESTS","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26028/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26028/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26028/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/019e37ff70cf05051c08f38112bfe8849ade0465","head":{"label":"peter-toth:SPARK-29359-better-exception-handling","ref":"SPARK-29359-better-exception-handling","sha":"019e37ff70cf05051c08f38112bfe8849ade0465","user":{"login":"peter-toth","id":7253827,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNTM4Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7253827?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth","html_url":"https://github.com/peter-toth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":130546049,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzA1NDYwNDk=","name":"spark","full_name":"peter-toth/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"peter-toth","id":7253827,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNTM4Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7253827?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth","html_url":"https://github.com/peter-toth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/peter-toth/spark","description":"Mirror

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdds support for parsing CSV data using multiple-character delimiters.  Existing logic for converting the input delimiter string to characters was kept and invoked in a loop.  Project dependencies were updated to remove redundant declaration of `univocity-parsers` version, and also to change that version to the latest.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIt is quite common for people to have delimited data, where the delimiter is not a single character, but rather a sequence of characters.  Currently, it is difficult to handle such data in Spark (typically needs pre-processing).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. Specifying the \"delimiter\" option for the DataFrame read, and providing more than one character, will no longer result in an exception.  Instead, it will be converted as before and passed to the underlying library (Univocity), which has accepted multiple character delimiters since 2.8.0.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe `CSVSuite` tests were confirmed passing (including new methods), and `sbt` tests for `sql` were executed.","created_at":"2019-10-04T18:24:46Z","updated_at":"2019-10-15T20:44:57Z","closed_at":"2019-10-15T20:44:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5c798c1d14955088c4d9bf6f9399b600d248d37a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26027/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26027/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26027/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/17ebe0cbcd639e2ef436ed105696bac3fd159b40","head":{"label":"jeff303:SPARK-24540","ref":"SPARK-24540","sha":"17ebe0cbcd639e2ef436ed105696bac3fd159b40","user":{"login":"jeff303","id":3521562,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MjE1NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3521562?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeff303","html_url":"https://github.com/jeff303","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeff303/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeff303/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeff303/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeff303/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeff303/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeff303/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeff303/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeff303/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeff303/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":207907929,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDc5MDc5Mjk=","name":"spark","full_name":"jeff303/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jeff303","id":3521562,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MjE1NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3521562?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeff303","html_url":"https://github.com/jeff303","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeff303/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeff303/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeff303/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeff303/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeff303/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeff303/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeff303/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeff303/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeff303/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jeff303/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdds \r\n\r\n```python\r\n_AFTSurvivalRegressionParams(HasFeaturesCol, HasLabelCol, HasPredictionCol,\r\n                                   HasMaxIter, HasTol, HasFitIntercept,\r\n                                   HasAggregationDepth): ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nwith related Params and uses it to replace `HasFitIntercept`, `HasMaxIter`, `HasTol` and  `HasAggregationDepth` in `AFTSurvivalRegression` base classes and `JavaPredictionModel,` in `AFTSurvivalRegressionModel` base classes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nPrevious work (#25776) on [SPARK-28985](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-28985) replaced `JavaEstimator`, `HasFeaturesCol`, `HasLabelCol`, `HasPredictionCol` in `AFTSurvivalRegression` and  `JavaModel` in `AFTSurvivalRegressionModel` with newly added `JavaPredictor`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/e97b55d32285052a1f76cca35377c4b21eb2e7d7/python/pyspark/ml/wrapper.py#L377\r\n\r\nand `JavaPredictionModel`\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/e97b55d32285052a1f76cca35377c4b21eb2e7d7/python/pyspark/ml/wrapper.py#L405\r\n\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\nThis however is inconsistent with Scala counterpart where both classes extend private `AFTSurvivalRegressionBase`\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/eb037a8180be4ab7570eda1fa9cbf3c84b92c3f7/mllib/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/ml/regression/AFTSurvivalRegression.scala#L48-L50\r\n\r\nThis preserves some of the existing inconsistencies (variables as defined in [the official example](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/examples/src/main/python/ml/aft_survival_regression.p))\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom pyspark.ml.regression import AFTSurvivalRegression, AFTSurvivalRegressionModel\r\nfrom pyspark.ml.param.shared import HasMaxIter, HasTol, HasFitIntercept, HasAggregationDepth\r\nfrom pyspark.ml.param import Param\r\n\r\nissubclass(AFTSurvivalRegressionModel, HasMaxIter)\r\n# False\r\nhasattr(model, \"maxIter\")  and isinstance(model.maxIter, Param)\r\n# True\r\n\r\nissubclass(AFTSurvivalRegressionModel, HasTol)\r\n# False\r\nhasattr(model, \"tol\")  and isinstance(model.tol, Param)\r\n# True\r\n```\r\n\r\nand can cause problems in the future, if Predictor / PredictionModel API changes (unlike [`IsotonicRegression`](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/26023), current implementation is technically speaking correct, though incomplete).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, it adds a number of base classes to `AFTSurvivalRegressionModel`. These change purely additive and have negligible potential for breaking existing code (and none, compared to changes already made in #25776). Additionally affected API hasn't been released in the current form yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- Existing unit tests.\r\n- Manual testing.\r\n\r\nCC @huaxingao,

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdds \r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass _IsotonicRegressionBase(HasFeaturesCol, HasLabelCol, HasPredictionCol, HasWeightCol): ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nwith related `Params` and uses it to replace `JavaPredictor` and `HasWeightCol` in `IsotonicRegression` base classes and `JavaPredictionModel,` in `IsotonicRegressionModel` base classes.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nPrevious work (#25776) on [SPARK-28985](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-28985) replaced `JavaEstimator`, `HasFeaturesCol`, `HasLabelCol`, `HasPredictionCol` in `IsotonicRegression` and `JavaModel` in `IsotonicRegressionModel` with newly added `JavaPredictor`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/e97b55d32285052a1f76cca35377c4b21eb2e7d7/python/pyspark/ml/wrapper.py#L377\r\n\r\nand `JavaPredictionModel`\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/e97b55d32285052a1f76cca35377c4b21eb2e7d7/python/pyspark/ml/wrapper.py#L405\r\n\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\nThis however is inconsistent with Scala counterpart where both  classes extend private `IsotonicRegressionBase`\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/3cb1b57809d0b4a93223669f5c10cea8fc53eff6/mllib/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/ml/regression/IsotonicRegression.scala#L42-L43\r\n\r\nThis preserves some of the existing inconsistencies (`model` as defined in [the official example](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/examples/src/main/python/ml/isotonic_regression_example.py)), i.e.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom pyspark.ml.regression impor IsotonicRegressionMode\r\nfrom pyspark.ml.param.shared import HasWeightCol\r\n\r\nissubclass(IsotonicRegressionModel, HasWeightCol) \r\n# False\r\n\r\nhasattr(model, \"weightCol\")                                                       \r\n# True\r\n```\r\n\r\nas well as introduces a bug, by adding unsupported `predict` method:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport inspect\r\n\r\nhasattr(model, \"predict\")                                                         \r\n# True\r\n\r\ninspect.getfullargspec(IsotonicRegressionModel.predict)                           \r\n# FullArgSpec(args=['self', 'value'], varargs=None, varkw=None, defaults=None, kwonlyargs=[], kwonlydefaults=None, annotations={})\r\n\r\nIsotonicRegressionModel.predict.__doc__                                                                                                                                                           \r\n# Predict label for the given features.\\n\\n        .. versionadded:: 3.0.0'\r\n\r\nmodel.predict(dataset.first().features)  \r\n\r\n# Py4JError: An error occurred while calling o49.predict. Trace:\r\n# py4j.Py4JException: Method predict([class org.apache.spark.ml.linalg.SparseVector]) does not exist\r\n# ...\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nFurthermore existing implementation can cause further problems in the future, if `Predictor` / `PredictionModel` API changes.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. It:\r\n\r\n- Removes invalid `IsotonicRegressionModel.predict` method.\r\n- Adds `HasWeightColumn` to `IsotonicRegressionModel`.\r\n\r\nhowever the faulty implementation hasn't been released yet, and proposed additions have negligible potential for breaking existing code (and none, compared to changes already made in #25776).\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- Existing unit tests.\r\n- Manual testing.\r\n\r\nCC @huaxingao,

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdded new expression `TimestampDiff` for timestamp subtractions. It accepts 2 timestamp expressions and returns another one of the `CalendarIntervalType`. While creating an instance of `CalendarInterval`, it initializes only the microsecond field by difference of the given timestamps in microseconds, and set the `months` field to zero. Also I added an rule for conversion `Subtract` to `TimestampDiff`, and enabled already ported test queries in `postgreSQL/timestamp.sql`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo maintain feature parity with PostgreSQL which allows to get timestamp difference:\r\n```sql\r\n# select timestamp'today' - timestamp'yesterday';\r\n ?column? \r\n----------\r\n 1 day\r\n(1 row)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, previously users got the following error from timestamp subtraction:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select timestamp'today' - timestamp'yesterday';\r\nError in query: cannot resolve '(TIMESTAMP('2019-10-04 00:00:00') - TIMESTAMP('2019-10-03 00:00:00'))' due to data type mismatch: '(TIMESTAMP('2019-10-04 00:00:00') - TIMESTAMP('2019-10-03 00:00:00'))' requires (numeric or interval) type, not timestamp; line 1 pos 7;\r\n'Project [unresolvedalias((1570136400000000 - 1570050000000000), None)]\r\n+- OneRowRelation\r\n``` \r\nafter the changes they should get an interval:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select timestamp'today' - timestamp'yesterday';\r\ninterval 1 days\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Added tests for `TimestampDiff` to `DateExpressionsSuite`\r\n- By new test in `TypeCoercionSuite`.\r\n- Enabled tests in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to let Python 2 uses UTF-8, instead of ASCII, with permissively replacing non-UDF-8 unicodes into unicode points in Python testing script.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWhen Python 2 is used to run the Python testing script, with `decode(encoding='ascii')`, it fails whenever non-ascii codes are printed out.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nTo dev, it will enable to support to print out non-ASCII characters.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nJenkins will test it for our existing test codes. Also, manually tested with UTF-8 output.","created_at":"2019-10-04T08:56:05Z","updated_at":"2020-03-03T01:17:49Z","closed_at":"2019-10-04T17:04:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0cac50bb4189f191c681ca225fd6147aa44dfca5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406590181,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTkwMTgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYSPARK","name":"PYSPARK","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1406606402,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA2NDAy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/TESTS","name":"TESTS","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26021/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26021/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26021/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a0f6ac252110e62c9c675369f05665314fe4db18","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-29286","ref":"SPARK-29286","sha":"a0f6ac252110e62c9c675369f05665314fe4db18","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

Session environments.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWe have checks to prevent the restarting of the same stream on the same spark session, but we can actually make that better in

Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nBefore this change Spark estimated the table size as the sum of all the file sizes. This estimate can be way too low at columnar file formats where huge data can be compressed into a very small file because of serialization (like dictionary encoding) and compression. \r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new statistic called `deserFactor` which is calculated for columnar file formats as a ratio of actual data size (raw data size) to file size which is used for scaling up the file size to improve the estimate of in-memory data size and having a better query optimization (i.e., join strategy decision). This way the OOM error which is the result of a wrongly chosen broadcast join strategy can be avoided.\r\n\r\nIn case of partitioned table the factors are calculated for each files and the maximum of these factors is taken. Spark stores this factor in the meta store and reuses it so the table can grow without having to recompute this statistic. The stored factor can be removed only by a `TRUNCATE` or a `DROP` table so even a subsequent `ANALYZE TABLE` where the calculation is disabled keeps the old value.\r\n\r\nAlthough this intended to be a generic solution for each columnar file formats this PR currently only focusing on the ORC file format.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe StatisticsSuite is extended with a new test: `SPARK-24914 - test deserialization factor (ORC)` which checks:\r\n- the factor calculation and application \r\n- keeping and using the old factor when the calculation is switched off\r\n- calculating it for multiple partitions\r\n- removing the factor at `TRUNCATE`","created_at":"2019-10-03T16:44:00Z","updated_at":"2020-09-21T00:46:32Z","closed_at":"2020-09-21T00:46:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"15a680933c0d31faf70cd7c5c5e5d9736fc20630","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26016/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26016/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26016/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/42933f2e3f6eb699745e399a1fc9f05288603d79","head":{"label":"attilapiros:SPARK-24914-pr","ref":"SPARK-24914-pr","sha":"42933f2e3f6eb699745e399a1fc9f05288603d79","user":{"login":"attilapiros","id":2017933,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTc5MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2017933?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros","html_url":"https://github.com/attilapiros","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":114023960,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTQwMjM5NjA=","name":"spark","full_name":"attilapiros/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"attilapiros","id":2017933,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTc5MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2017933?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros","html_url":"https://github.com/attilapiros","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/attilapiros/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nDynamic partition pruning filters are added as an in-subquery containing a `BroadcastExchangeExec` in case of a broadcast hash join. This PR makes the `ReuseExchange` rule visit in-subquery nodes, to ensure the new `BroadcastExchangeExec` added by dynamic partition pruning can be reused.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis initial dynamic partition pruning PR did not enable this reuse, which means a broadcast exchange would be executed twice, in the main query and in the DPP filter.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded broadcast exchange reuse check in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSupport FETCH_PRIOR fetching in Thriftserver, and report correct fetch start offset it TFetchResultsResp.results.startRowOffset\r\n\r\nThe semantics of FETCH_PRIOR are as follow: Assuming the previous fetch returned a block of rows from offsets [10, 20)\r\n* calling FETCH_PRIOR(maxRows=5) will scroll back and return rows [5, 10)\r\n* calling FETCH_PRIOR(maxRows=10) again, will scroll back, but can't go earlier than 0. It will nevertheless return 10 rows, returning rows [0, 10) (overlapping with the previous fetch)\r\n* calling FETCH_PRIOR(maxRows=4) again will again return rows starting from offset 0 - [0, 4)\r\n* calling FETCH_NEXT(maxRows=6) after that will move the cursor forward and return rows [4, 10)\r\n\r\n##### Client/server backwards/forwards compatibility:\r\n\r\nOld driver with new server:\r\n* Drivers that don't support FETCH_PRIOR will not attempt to use it\r\n* Field TFetchResultsResp.results.startRowOffset was not set, old drivers don't depend on it.\r\n\r\nNew driver with old server\r\n* Using an older thriftserver with FETCH_PRIOR will make the thriftserver return unsupported operation error. The driver can then recognize that it's an old server.\r\n* Older thriftserver will return TFetchResultsResp.results.startRowOffset=0. If the client driver receives 0, it can know that it can not rely on it as correct offset. If the client driver intentionally wants to fetch from 0, it can use FETCH_FIRST.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIt's intended to be used to recover after connection errors. If a client lost connection during fetching (e.g. of rows [10, 20)), and wants to reconnect and continue, it could not know whether the request  got lost before reaching the server, or on the response back. When it issued another FETCH_NEXT(10) request after reconnecting, because TFetchResultsResp.results.startRowOffset was not set, it could not know if the server will return rows [10,20) (because the previous request didn't reach it) or rows [20, 30) (because it returned data from the previous request but the connection got broken on the way back). Now, with TFetchResultsResp.results.startRowOffset the client can know after reconnecting which rows it is getting, and use FETCH_PRIOR to scroll back if a fetch block was lost in transmission.\r\n\r\nDriver should always use FETCH_PRIOR after a broken connection.\r\n* If the Thriftserver returns unsuported operation error, the driver knows that it's an old server that doesn't support it. The driver then must error the query, as it will also not support returning the correct startRowOffset, so the driver cannot reliably guarantee if it hadn't lost any rows on the fetch cursor.\r\n* If the driver gets a response to FETCH_PRIOR, it should also have a correctly set startRowOffset, which the driver can use to position itself back where it left off before the connection broke.\r\n* If FETCH_NEXT was used after a broken connection on the first fetch, and returned with an startRowOffset=0, then the client driver can't know if it's 0 because it's the older server version, or if it's genuinely 0. Better to call FETCH_PRIOR, as scrolling back may anyway be possibly required after a broken connection.\r\n\r\nThis way it is implemented in a backwards/forwards compatible way, and doesn't require bumping the protocol version. FETCH_ABSOLUTE might have been better, but that would require a bigger protocol change, as there is currently no field to specify the requested absolute offset.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nODBC/JDBC drivers connecting to Thriftserver may now implement using the FETCH_PRIOR fetch order to scroll back in query results, and check TFetchResultsResp.results.startRowOffset if their cursor position is consistent after connection errors.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded tests to HiveThriftServer2Suites","created_at":"2019-10-03T16:13:47Z","updated_at":"2019-10-16T06:59:33Z","closed_at":"2019-10-16T06:22:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"39a213e51978e9247621045a0d375d9192041146","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26014/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26014/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26014/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/62e1f98aa9ad92d958e85e7b499da6ab0ffd4119","head":{"label":"juliuszsompolski:SPARK-29349","ref":"SPARK-29349","sha":"62e1f98aa9ad92d958e85e7b499da6ab0ffd4119","user":{"login":"juliuszsompolski","id":25019163,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MDE5MTYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25019163?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski","html_url":"https://github.com/juliuszsompolski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":82301030,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MjMwMTAzMA==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"juliuszsompolski/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"juliuszsompolski","id":25019163,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MDE5MTYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25019163?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski","html_url":"https://github.com/juliuszsompolski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/juliuszsompolski/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR adds JSON serialization for Spark external Rows.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis is to be used for observable metrics where the `StreamingQueryProgress` contains a map of observed metrics rows which needs to be serialized in some cases.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, a user can call `toJson` on rows returned when collecting a DataFrame to the driver.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded a new test suite: `RowJsonSuite` that should test this.\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-03T14:53:34Z","updated_at":"2019-10-15T05:18:57Z","closed_at":"2019-10-14T22:24:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a6cf9603f7730d24965f51b26470f0edfb9ea55b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26013/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26013/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26013/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/43c2d249614359e80f61c275b16e0a498abcb842","head":{"label":"hvanhovell:SPARK-29347","ref":"SPARK-29347","sha":"43c2d249614359e80f61c275b16e0a498abcb842","user":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35900688,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTkwMDY4OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"hvanhovell/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR adds an accumulator that computes a global aggregate over a number of rows. A user can define an arbitrary number of aggregate functions which can be computed at the same time.\r\n\r\nThe accumulator uses the standard technique for implementing (interpreted) aggregation in Spark. It uses projections and manual updates for each of the aggregation steps (initialize buffer, update buffer with new input row, merge two buffers and compute the final result on the buffer). Note that two of the steps (update and merge) use the aggregation buffer both as input and output.\r\n\r\nAccumulators do not have an explicit point at which they get serialized. A somewhat surprising side effect is that the buffers of a `TypedImperativeAggregate` go over the wire as-is instead of serializing them. The merging logic for `TypedImperativeAggregate` assumes that the input buffer contains serialized buffers, this is violated by the accumulator's implicit serialization. In order to get around this I have added `mergeBuffersObjects` method that merges two unserialized buffers to `TypedImperativeAggregate`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis is the mechanism we are going to use to implement observable metrics.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo, not yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded `AggregatingAccumulator` test suite.\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-03T12:59:25Z","updated_at":"2019-10-09T14:05:24Z","closed_at":"2019-10-09T14:05:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"536e9168033cbde9fa50682b07ba19ba8e5c321f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26012/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26012/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26012/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ebb974e419f786d4f448d340a4ba4a57f7f45feb","head":{"label":"hvanhovell:SPARK-29346","ref":"SPARK-29346","sha":"ebb974e419f786d4f448d340a4ba4a57f7f45feb","user":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35900688,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTkwMDY4OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"hvanhovell/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell/spark","description":"Mirror

https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/21853. \r\nThe `Sort` without `Limit` operator in `Join` subquery is useless, it's the same case in `GroupBy` when the aggregation function is order irrelevant, such as `count`, `sum`. \r\nThis PR try to remove this kind of `Sort` operator in `SQL Optimizer`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFor example,  `select count(1) from (select a from test1 order by a)` is equal to `select count(1) from (select a from test1)`. \r\n'select * from (select a from test1 order by a) t1 join (select b from test2) t2 on t1.a = t2.b' is equal to `select * from

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the PR, I propose to pass the `Pattern.CASE_INSENSITIVE` flag while compiling interval patterns in `CalendarInterval`. This makes casting string values to intervals case insensitive and tolerant to case of the `interval`, `year(s)`, `month(s)`, `week(s)`, `day(s)`, `hour(s)`, `minute(s)`, `second(s)`, `millisecond(s)` and `microsecond(s)`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThere are at least 2 reasons:\r\n- To maintain feature parity with PostgreSQL which is not sensitive to case:\r\n```sql\r\n # select cast('10 Days' as INTERVAL);\r\n interval \r\n----------\r\n 10 days\r\n(1 row)\r\n```\r\n- Spark is tolerant to case of interval literals. Case insensitivity in casting should be convenient for Spark users.\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> SELECT INTERVAL 1 YEAR 1 WEEK;\r\ninterval 1 years 1 weeks\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, current implementation produces `NULL` for `interval`, `year`, ... `microsecond` that are not in lower case.\r\nBefore:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> SELECT CAST('INTERVAL 10 DAYS' as INTERVAL);\r\nNULL\r\n```\r\nAfter:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> SELECT CAST('INTERVAL 10 DAYS' as INTERVAL);\r\ninterval 1 weeks 3 days\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- by new tests in `CalendarIntervalSuite.java`\r\n- new test in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis adds a trait that data source v2 users can mix-in to have a the Hadoop configuration serialized and broadcasted.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nAll of our Hadoop Data Source V2 implementations do a variation of this internally. We should reduce the copy pasta code inside of Spark and simplify this for external data source implementations as well.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNot for people building Spark applications, but for people building DataSource V2 implementations this standardizes how to access the Hadoop conf.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nSpark's existing V2 data sources are now using this feature, meaning the Hadoop configuration serialization and broadcasting will now be exercised through their tests. Validated by the fact I screwed it up first and they failed.","created_at":"2019-10-02T21:46:07Z","updated_at":"2020-02-24T00:12:30Z","closed_at":"2020-02-24T00:12:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"956e10e878b5cae9543ff23cfdc13ba27ebb66f5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26005/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26005/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26005/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/aadd185a3d98d1ed056c0a8498c254db19298b81","head":{"label":"holdenk:SPARK-29163-simplify-hadoop-conf-access-in-DSv2","ref":"SPARK-29163-simplify-hadoop-conf-access-in-DSv2","sha":"aadd185a3d98d1ed056c0a8498c254db19298b81","user":{"login":"holdenk","id":59893,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5ODkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59893?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk","html_url":"https://github.com/holdenk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17235154,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzNTE1NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"holdenk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"holdenk","id":59893,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5ODkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59893?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk","html_url":"https://github.com/holdenk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/holdenk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR regenerates the `sql/core` benchmarks in JDK8/11 to compare the result. In general, we compare the ratio instead of the time. However, in this PR, the average time is compared. This PR should be considered as a rough comparison.\r\n\r\n**A. EXPECTED CASES(JDK11 is faster in general)**\r\n- [x] BloomFilterBenchmark (JDK11 is faster except one case)\r\n- [x] BuiltInDataSourceWriteBenchmark (JDK11 is faster at CSV/ORC)\r\n- [x] CSVBenchmark (JDK11 is faster except five cases)\r\n- [x] ColumnarBatchBenchmark (JDK11 is faster at `boolean`/`string` and some cases in `int`/`array`)\r\n- [x] DatasetBenchmark (JDK11 is faster with `string`, but is slower for `long` type)\r\n- [x] ExternalAppendOnlyUnsafeRowArrayBenchmark (JDK11 is faster except two cases)\r\n- [x] ExtractBenchmark (JDK11 is faster except HOUR/MINUTE/SECOND/MILLISECONDS/MICROSECONDS)\r\n- [x] HashedRelationMetricsBenchmark (JDK11 is faster)\r\n- [x] JSONBenchmark (JDK11 is much faster except eight cases)\r\n- [x] JoinBenchmark (JDK11 is faster except five cases)\r\n- [x] OrcNestedSchemaPruningBenchmark (JDK11 is faster in nine cases)\r\n- [x] PrimitiveArrayBenchmark (JDK11 is faster)\r\n- [x] SortBenchmark (JDK11 is faster except `Arrays.sort` case)\r\n- [x] UDFBenchmark (N/A, values are too small)\r\n- [x] UnsafeArrayDataBenchmark (JDK11 is faster except one case)\r\n- [x] WideTableBenchmark (JDK11 is faster except two cases)\r\n\r\n**B. CASES WE NEED TO INVESTIGATE MORE LATER**\r\n- [x] AggregateBenchmark (JDK11 is slower in general)\r\n- [x] CompressionSchemeBenchmark (JDK11 is slower in general except `string`)\r\n- [x] DataSourceReadBenchmark (JDK11 is slower in general)\r\n- [x] DateTimeBenchmark (JDK11 is slightly slower in general except `parsing`)\r\n- [x] MakeDateTimeBenchmark (JDK11 is slower except two cases)\r\n- [x] MiscBenchmark (JDK11 is slower except ten cases)\r\n- [x] OrcV2NestedSchemaPruningBenchmark (JDK11 is slower)\r\n- [x] ParquetNestedSchemaPruningBenchmark (JDK11 is slower except six cases)\r\n- [x] RangeBenchmark (JDK11 is slower except one case)\r\n\r\n`FilterPushdownBenchmark/InExpressionBenchmark/WideSchemaBenchmark` will be compared later because it took long timer.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nAccording to the result, there are some difference between JDK8/JDK11.\r\nThis will be a baseline for the future improvement and comparison.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4.

For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAs of now, Spark uses hardcoded value `spark_shuffle` as the name of the Shuffle Service.\r\n\r\nHDP distribution of Spark, on the other hand, uses [`spark2_shuffle`](https://github.com/hortonworks/spark2-release/blob/HDP-3.1.0.0-78-tag/resource-managers/yarn/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/yarn/ExecutorRunnable.scala#L117). This is done to be able to run both Spark 1.6 and Spark 2.x on the same Hadoop cluster.\r\n\r\nRunning vanilla Spark on HDP cluster with only Spark 2.x shuffle service (HDP favor) running becomes impossible due to the shuffle service name mismatch.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe test cases were changed to use the new option.\r\nPatched version of `spark_yarn` library was used to run jobs on HDP

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nI introduced new constants `SECONDS_PER_MONTH` and `MILLIS_PER_MONTH`, and reused it in calculations of seconds/milliseconds per month. `SECONDS_PER_MONTH` is 2629746 because the average year of the Gregorian calendar is 365.2425 days long or 60 * 60 * 24 * 365.2425 = 31556952.0 = 12 * 2629746 seconds per year.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSpark uses the proleptic Gregorian calendar (see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-26651) in which the average year is 365.2425 days (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar) but existing implementation assumes 31 days per months or 12 * 31 = 372 days. That's far away from the the truth.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n Yes, the changes affect at least 3 methods in `GroupStateImpl`, `EventTimeWatermark` and `MonthsBetween`. For example, the `month_between()` function will return different result in some cases.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select months_between('2019-09-15', '1970-01-01');\r\n596.4516129\r\n```\r\nAfter:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select months_between('2019-09-15', '1970-01-01');\r\n596.45996838\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy existing test suite `DateTimeUtilsSuite`, `DateFunctionsSuite` and `DateExpressionsSuite`.\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-02T10:49:55Z","updated_at":"2020-06-05T19:41:24Z","closed_at":"2019-10-07T13:47:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a7c565c25722b7ef8e9da27444b81bd73530d33e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25998/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25998/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/25998/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9d78910c4b89855c734e8c24e5cdb27738831631","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:days-in-year","ref":"days-in-year","sha":"9d78910c4b89855c734e8c24e5cdb27738831631","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to enable `closeFrameOnFlush` for ZstdOutputStream specific to event logger, so that continuous input stream of zstd is not stuck when reading \"inprogress\" event log file.\r\n\r\nThe issue seems to be introduced from [SPARK-26283](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-26283) which addressed some bug via reading event log file with enabling continuous mode, but it changed the behavior of input stream to read open frame, which seem to wait for frame to be closed. Enabling `closeFrameOnFlush` would close frame whenever flush is called, so input stream could read the frame sooner.\r\n\r\nAs a pair of `compressedContinuousInputStream`, this patch adds `compressedContinuousOutputStream` which will be only used for event logging.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWithout this patch, the reader thread in SHS is stuck on reading inprogress event log file compressed with zstd until the application becomes finished.  \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nIt might bring some overhead on each flush when writing zstd compressed event log, so some sort of performance hit could be introduced. I've restricted the case to only event logging.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested, via setting Spark configuration as below:\r\n\r\n```\r\nspark.eventLog.enabled                     true\r\nspark.eventLog.compress                  true\r\nspark.eventLog.compression.codec zstd\r\n```\r\n\r\nand start Spark application. While the application is running, load the application in SHS webpage. \r\n\r\nBefore this patch, it may succeed to replay the event log, but high likely it will be stuck and loading page will be also stuck. After this patch, SHS can properly reads the inprogress event log file.\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-02T07:05:53Z","updated_at":"2019-10-03T20:55:31Z","closed_at":"2019-10-03T03:48:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d5fcad0d180dd3a67c6e8f1c3b02e06b56801f16","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the PR merge script, decode the raw output of subprocess commands like `git` using UTF-8 encoding, consistently.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe merge script occasionally fails if run with Python 2 and the output of a command like `git` contains non-ASCII characters. I think this most usually happens when a user name, for example, contains Chinese characters.\r\n\r\nThis is because the output is decoded according to `sys.getdefaultencoding()`, which is ASCII in Python 2. It's UTF-8 in Python 3, by default.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe change caused a merge that failed before to succeed.","created_at":"2019-10-01T15:15:08Z","updated_at":"2019-10-09T14:09:42Z","closed_at":"2019-10-02T02:29:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"98ab56fd36a2776be2abdd54f69a58917481e7b2","assignee":{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25991/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25991/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/25991/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f3fcd7f23faa0b1eeea92f769db50cfe0b4e9518","head":{"label":"srowen:MergePRUTF8","ref":"MergePRUTF8","sha":"f3fcd7f23faa0b1eeea92f769db50cfe0b4e9518","user":{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17241201,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzI0MTIwMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"srowen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/srowen/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhen implementing a ScanBuilder, we require the implementor to provide the schema of the data and the number of partitions.\r\n\r\nHowever, when someone is implementing WriteBuilder we only pass them the schema, but not the number of partitions. This is an asymetrical developer experience. \r\n\r\nThis PR adds a `PhysicalWriteInfo` interface that is passed to `createBatchWriterFactory` and `createStreamingWriterFactory` that adds the number of partitions of the data that is going to be written.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nPassing in the number of partitions on the WriteBuilder would enable data sources to provision their write targets before starting to write. For example:\r\n- it could be used to provision a Kafka topic with a specific number of partitions\r\n- it could be used to scale a microservice prior to sending the data to it\r\n- it could be used to create a DsV2 that sends the data to another spark cluster (currently not possible since the reader wouldn't be able to know the number of partitions)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNot tested

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to avoid abstract classes introduced at https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/24965 but instead uses trait and object.\r\n\r\n- `abstract class BaseArrowPythonRunner` -> `trait PythonArrowOutput` to allow mix-in\r\n\r\n    **Before:**\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    BasePythonRunner\r\n    ├── BaseArrowPythonRunner\r\n    │   ├── ArrowPythonRunner\r\n    │   └── CoGroupedArrowPythonRunner\r\n    ├── PythonRunner\r\n    └── PythonUDFRunner\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    **After:**\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    └── BasePythonRunner\r\n        ├── ArrowPythonRunner\r\n        ├── CoGroupedArrowPythonRunner\r\n        ├── PythonRunner\r\n        └── PythonUDFRunner\r\n    ```\r\n- `abstract class BasePandasGroupExec ` -> `object PandasGroupUtils` to decouple\r\n\r\n    **Before:**\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    └── BasePandasGroupExec\r\n        ├── FlatMapGroupsInPandasExec\r\n        └── FlatMapCoGroupsInPandasExec\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    **After:**\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    ├── FlatMapGroupsInPandasExec\r\n    └── FlatMapCoGroupsInPandasExec\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe problem is that R code path is being matched with Python side:\r\n\r\n**Python:**\r\n\r\n```\r\n└── BasePythonRunner\r\n    ├── ArrowPythonRunner\r\n    ├── CoGroupedArrowPythonRunner\r\n    ├── PythonRunner\r\n    └── PythonUDFRunner\r\n```\r\n\r\n**R:**\r\n\r\n```\r\n└── BaseRRunner\r\n    ├── ArrowRRunner\r\n    └── RRunner\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would like to match the hierarchy and decouple other stuff for now if possible. Ideally we should deduplicate both code paths. Internal implementation is also similar intentionally.\r\n\r\n`BasePandasGroupExec` case is similar as well. R (with Arrow optimization, in particular) has some duplicated codes with Pandas UDFs. \r\n\r\n`FlatMapGroupsInRWithArrowExec` <> `FlatMapGroupsInPandasExec`\r\n`MapPartitionsInRWithArrowExec` <> `ArrowEvalPythonExec`\r\n\r\nIn order to prepare deduplication here as well, it might better avoid changing hierarchy alone in Python side.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nLocally tested existing tests. Jenkins tests should verify this too.\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-01T13:23:57Z","updated_at":"2020-03-03T01:17:50Z","closed_at":"2019-10-03T07:42:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c53c2aa88bb65c2f52c62d98fc7ce3b648dc5266","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406590181,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTkwMTgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYSPARK","name":"PYSPARK","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25989/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25989/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/25989/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/868cda2a99b503543a7a18fd3b55df0d8d49e2b9","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-29317","ref":"SPARK-29317","sha":"868cda2a99b503543a7a18fd3b55df0d8d49e2b9","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to specify the save mode explicitly while writing to the `noop` datasource in benchmarks. I set `Overwrite` mode in the following benchmarks:\r\n- JsonBenchmark\r\n- CSVBenchmark\r\n- UDFBenchmark\r\n- MakeDateTimeBenchmark\r\n- ExtractBenchmark\r\n- DateTimeBenchmark\r\n- NestedSchemaPruningBenchmark\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nOtherwise writing to `noop` fails with:\r\n```\r\n[error] Exception in thread \"main\" org.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: TableProvider implementation noop cannot be written with ErrorIfExists mode, please use Append or Overwrite modes instead.;\r\n[error] \tat org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrameWriter.save(DataFrameWriter.scala:284)\r\n```\r\nmost likely due to https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/25876\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nI generated results of `ExtractBenchmark` via the command:\r\n```\r\nSPARK_GENERATE_BENCHMARK_FILES=1 build/sbt \"sql/test:runMain

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes the behavior of ProgressReporter which always overwrite the value of \"updated\" of state operator to 0 if there's no new data. The behavior is correct only when we copy the state progress from \"previous\" executed plan, meaning no batch has been run. (Nonzero value of \"updated\" would be odd if batch didn't run, so it was correct.) \r\n\r\nIt was safe to assume no data is no batch, but SPARK-24156 enables empty data can run the batch if Spark needs to deal with watermark. After the patch, it only overwrites the value if both two conditions are met: 1) no data 2) no batch. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently Spark doesn't reflect correct metrics when empty batch is run and this patch fixes it.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nModified UT. Note that FlatMapGroupsWithState increases the value of \"updated\" when state rows are removed.\r\nAlso manually tested via below query (not a simple query to test with spark-shell, as you'll meet closure issue in spark-shell while playing with state func):\r\n\r\n> query\r\n\r\n```\r\ncase class RunningCount(count: Long)\r\n\r\nobject TestFlatMapGroupsWithState {\r\n  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {\r\n    import org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession\r\n\r\n    val ss = SparkSession\r\n      .builder()\r\n      .appName(\"TestFlatMapGroupsWithState\")\r\n      .getOrCreate()\r\n\r\n    ss.conf.set(\"spark.sql.shuffle.partitions\", \"5\")\r\n\r\n    import ss.implicits._\r\n\r\n    val stateFunc = (key: String, values: Iterator[String], state: GroupState[RunningCount]) => {\r\n      if (state.hasTimedOut) {\r\n        // End users are not restricted to remove the state here - they can update the\r\n        // state as well.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdded new expression `SecondWithFraction` which produces the `seconds` part of timestamps/dates with fractional part containing microseconds. This expression is used only in the `DatePart` expression. As the result, `date_part()` and `extract` return seconds and microseconds as the fractional part of the seconds part when `field` is `SECOND` (or synonyms).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe `date_part()` and `extract` were added to maintain feature parity with PostgreSQL which has different behavior for the `SECOND` value of the `field` parameter. The fix is needed to behave in the same way. Here is PostgreSQL's output:\r\n```sql\r\n# SELECT date_part('SECONDS', timestamp'2019-10-01 00:00:01.000001');\r\n date_part \r\n-----------\r\n  1.000001\r\n(1 row)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, type of `date_part('SECOND', ...)` is changed from `INT` to `DECIMAL(8, 6)`.\r\nBefore:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> SELECT date_part('SECONDS', '2019-10-01 00:00:01.000001');\r\n1\r\n```\r\nAfter:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> SELECT date_part('SECONDS', '2019-10-01 00:00:01.000001');\r\n1.000001\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Added new tests to `DateExpressionSuite` for the `SecondWithFraction` expression\r\n- Regenerated results of `date_part.sql`, `extract.sql` and `timestamp.sql`\r\n- Updated results of `ExtractBenchmark`\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-01T09:13:22Z","updated_at":"2019-10-05T19:18:39Z","closed_at":"2019-10-02T02:16:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cd537dc0af85e5c673e29866b12e6237295f7271","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25986/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25986/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/25986/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c4fc2799110e408940732f72505b2b13104b1fd1","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:extract-seconds-from-timestamp","ref":"extract-seconds-from-timestamp","sha":"c4fc2799110e408940732f72505b2b13104b1fd1","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR updates `TestMemoryManager`, a class used only in unit tests, to override the `getExecutionMemoryUsageForTask()` and `releaseAllExecutionMemoryForTask()` methods. I also `synchronized` its state-accessing methods (to make the class thread-safe) and added some additional assertions to guard against freeing memory memory than has been allocated.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nSpark uses a `TestMemoryManager` class to mock out memory manager functionality in tests, allowing test authors to exercise control over certain behaviors (e.g. to simulate OOMs).\r\n\r\nSeveral of Spark's test suites have memory-leak detection to ensure that all allocated memory is cleaned up at the end of each test case; this helps to guard against bugs that could cause production memory leaks. For example, see `testWithMemoryLeakDetection` in `UnsafeFixedWidthAggregationMapSuite`.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, however, this leak-detection logic is broken for tests which use TestMemoryManager because it does not override the `getExecutionMemoryUsageForTask()` method that is used by the leak-detection checks.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes that problem, thereby strengthening our existing tests. \r\n\r\nI spotted this problem while reviewing #25953: I tried introducing a change to remove a `freePage()` call (purposely inducing a memory leak) but no tests failed.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded a new `TestMemoryManagerSuite`, with tests covering `TestMemoryManager` itself.\r\n\r\nRan a subset of existing tests on my laptop and uncovered a bug in one test's `free()` calls, plus missing cleanup calls in another test suite; both of these issues are fixed in this PR.\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-01T07:31:07Z","updated_at":"2019-10-15T16:15:18Z","closed_at":"2019-10-02T03:07:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f797b2fe93039f3aa3a96f7de6a36d1ecf560a15","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR will mainly introduce two new APIs in both “Predictor” and “PredictionModel”, and a new parameter named “featuresCols” in “sharedParams”.\r\n**APIs:**\r\n`def setFeaturesCol(value: Array[String]): M = ...`\r\n`protected def isSupportMultiColumnsForFeatures: Boolean = false`\r\n**Parameter:**\r\n`final val featuresCols: StringArrayParam = new StringArrayParam(this, \"featuresCols\",   ...)`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThere are always more features than one in a classification/regression task, however the current API to specify features columns in Predictor of Spark MLLib only supports one single column, which requires users to assemble the multiple features columns into a \"org.apache.spark.ml.linalg.Vector\" before fitting to Spark ML pipeline. So users have to spend some extra time to search and learn other transformers that can do this vectorization thing, then pick one in their applications. It looks like somewhat complicated.\r\n\r\nWith this PR, things become much more simple to run a machine learning task. Users no longer need the vectorization step for features columns, just specify these features columns by our new API, then fit the loaded the dataset directly to Spark ML Pipeline. It not only makes the ML application code more concise, but also saves a lot of time to learn other transformers for vectorization to run a classification/regression task , especially for novices at Spark ML.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, it is adding a new API `setFeaturesCol(value: Array[String]` for users to specify multiple columns for features directly,

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe `date_part()` function can accept the `source` parameter of the `INTERVAL` type (`CalendarIntervalType`). The following values of the `field` parameter are supported:\r\n- `\"MILLENNIUM\"` (`\"MILLENNIA\"`, `\"MIL\"`, `\"MILS\"`) - number of millenniums in the given interval. It is `YEAR / 1000`.\r\n- `\"CENTURY\"` (`\"CENTURIES\"`, `\"C\"`, `\"CENT\"`) - number of centuries in the interval calculated as `YEAR / 100`.\r\n- `\"DECADE\"` (`\"DECADES\"`, `\"DEC\"`, `\"DECS\"`) - decades in the `YEAR` part of the interval calculated as `YEAR / 10`.\r\n- `\"YEAR\"` (`\"Y\"`, `\"YEARS\"`, `\"YR\"`, `\"YRS\"`) - years in a values of `CalendarIntervalType`. It is `MONTHS / 12`.\r\n- `\"QUARTER\"` (`\"QTR\"`) - a quarter of year calculated as `MONTHS / 3 + 1` \r\n- `\"MONTH\"` (`\"MON\"`, `\"MONS\"`, `\"MONTHS\"`) - the months part of the interval calculated as `CalendarInterval.months % 12`\r\n- `\"DAY\"` (`\"D\"`, `\"DAYS\"`) - total number of days in `CalendarInterval.microseconds` \r\n- `\"HOUR\"` (`\"H\"`, `\"HOURS\"`, `\"HR\"`, `\"HRS\"`) - the hour part of the interval.\r\n- `\"MINUTE\"` (`\"M\"`, `\"MIN\"`, `\"MINS\"`, `\"MINUTES\"`) - the minute part of the interval.\r\n- `\"SECOND\"` (`\"S\"`, `\"SEC\"`, `\"SECONDS\"`, `\"SECS\"`) - the seconds part with fractional microsecond part.  \r\n- `\"MILLISECONDS\"` (`\"MSEC\"`, `\"MSECS\"`, `\"MILLISECON\"`, `\"MSECONDS\"`, `\"MS\"`) - the millisecond part of the interval with fractional microsecond part.\r\n- `\"MICROSECONDS\"` (`\"USEC\"`, `\"USECS\"`, `\"USECONDS\"`, `\"MICROSECON\"`, `\"US\"`) - the total number of microseconds in the `second`, `millisecond` and `microsecond` parts of the given interval.\r\n- `\"EPOCH\"` - the total number of seconds in the interval including the fractional part with microsecond precision. Here we assume 365.25 days per year (leap year every four years).\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```sql\r\n> SELECT date_part('days', interval 1 year 10 months 5 days);\r\n 5\r\n> SELECT date_part('seconds', interval 30 seconds 1 milliseconds 1 microseconds);\r\n 30.001001\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo maintain feature parity with PostgreSQL (https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/functions-datetime.html#FUNCTIONS-DATETIME-EXTRACT)\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Added new test suite `IntervalExpressionsSuite`\r\n- Add new test cases to `date_part.sql`\r\n","created_at":"2019-09-30T18:56:38Z","updated_at":"2020-06-05T19:41:29Z","closed_at":"2019-10-18T15:55:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a742c918c220182f4bb507288ca28e316973625e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25981/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25981/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/25981/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5620472a26f57590f2d5a67b24b5295980641f1c","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:extract-from-intervals","ref":"extract-from-intervals","sha":"5620472a26f57590f2d5a67b24b5295980641f1c","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nScala 2.13 removes the parallel collections classes to a separate library, so first, this establishes a `scala-2.13` profile to bring it back, for future use.\r\n\r\nHowever the library enables use of `.par` implicit conversions via a new class that is not in 2.12, which makes cross-building hard. This implements a suggested workaround from https://github.com/scala/scala-parallel-collections/issues/22 to avoid `.par` entirely.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo compile for 2.13 and later to work with 2.13.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nShould not, no.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests.","created_at":"2019-09-30T17:03:40Z","updated_at":"2019-10-09T14:10:38Z","closed_at":"2019-10-03T13:56:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e0cfd9bc2ac000e4f7ccb1f8bb024e336523c365","assignee":{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to delete old Hive external partition directory even the partition does not exist in Hive, when insert overwrite Hive external table partition.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWhen insert overwrite to a Hive external table partition, if the partition does not exist, Hive will not check if the external partition directory exists or not before copying files. So if users drop the partition, and then do insert overwrite to the same partition, the partition will have both old and new data.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```scala\r\nwithSQLConf(HiveUtils.CONVERT_METASTORE_PARQUET.key -> \"false\") {\r\n  // test is an external Hive table.\r\n  sql(\"INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE test PARTITION(name='n1') SELECT 1\")\r\n  sql(\"ALTER TABLE test DROP PARTITION(name='n1')\")\r\n  sql(\"INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE test PARTITION(name='n1') SELECT 2\")\r\n  sql(\"SELECT id FROM test WHERE name = 'n1' ORDER BY id\") // Got both 1 and 2.\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes. This fix a correctness issue when users drop partition on a Hive external table partition and then insert overwrite it.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded test.","created_at":"2019-09-30T16:39:58Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:37:53Z","closed_at":"2019-10-18T08:35:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d656b08b4b510e7ca66ef58ef73ac9eaa89f9075","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25979/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25979/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/25979/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8337870e62c9550235ebc4357a4711fe1197812a","head":{"label":"viirya:SPARK-29295","ref":"SPARK-29295","sha":"8337870e62c9550235ebc4357a4711fe1197812a","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to fix the issue that storage memory is not decreasing even block is removed in BlockManager. Originally the issue is found while removed broadcast doesn't reflect the storage memory on driver/executors.\r\n\r\nAppStatusListener expects the value of memory in events on block update as \"delta\" so that it adjusts driver/executors' storage memory based on delta, but when removing block BlockManager reports the delta as 0, so the storage memory is not decreased. `BlockManager.dropFromMemory` deals with this correctly, so some of path of freeing memory has been updated correctly.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe storage memory in metrics in AppStatusListener is now out of sync which lets end users easy to confuse as memory leak is happening.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nModified UTs. Also manually tested via running simple query repeatedly and observe executor page of Spark UI to see the value of storage memory is decreasing as well.\r\n\r\nPlease refer the description of [SPARK-29055](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-29055) to get simple reproducer.","created_at":"2019-09-30T07:15:16Z","updated_at":"2019-10-14T22:22:36Z","closed_at":"2019-10-01T16:42:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"afe807fae843a287be897936aa7abb5a5b351b3d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nExecutor's heartbeat will send synchronously to BlockManagerMaster to let it know that the block manager is still alive. In a heavy cluster, it will timeout and cause block manager re-register unexpected.\r\nThis improvement will separate a heartbeat endpoint from the driver endpoint. In our production environment, this was really helpful to prevent executors from unstable up and down.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n`BlockManagerMasterEndpoint` handles many events from executors like `RegisterBlockManager`, `GetLocations`, `RemoveShuffle`, `RemoveExecutor` etc. In a heavy cluster/app, it is always busy. The `BlockManagerHeartbeat` event also was handled in this endpoint. We found it may timeout when it's busy.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nScala 2.13 emits a deprecation warning for procedure-like declarations:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef foo() {\r\n ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is equivalent to the following, so should be changed to avoid a warning:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef foo(): Unit = {\r\n  ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIt will avoid about a thousand compiler warnings when we start to support Scala 2.13. I wanted to make the change in 3.0 as there are less likely to be back-ports from 3.0 to 2.4 than 3.1 to 3.0, for example, minimizing that downside to touching so many files.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, that makes this quite a big change.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo behavior change at all.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests.","created_at":"2019-09-29T23:33:10Z","updated_at":"2020-02-05T18:26:11Z","closed_at":"2019-09-30T17:03:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9daacffbe7689eb2b85e25f67dc783813564e9b5","assignee":{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25968/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25968/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/25968/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4645f2d1e41902d3ce8f100ffccf86babced5e62","head":{"label":"srowen:SPARK-29291","ref":"SPARK-29291","sha":"4645f2d1e41902d3ce8f100ffccf86babced5e62","user":{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17241201,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzI0MTIwMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"srowen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/srowen/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCredits to @tdas who reported and described the fix to [SPARK-26425](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-26425). I just followed the description of the issue.\r\n\r\nThis patch adds more checks on commit log as well as file streaming source so that multiple concurrent runs of streaming query don't mess up the status of query/checkpoint. This patch addresses two different spots which are having a bit different issues:\r\n\r\n1. FileStreamSource.fetchMaxOffset()\r\n\r\nIn structured streaming, we don't allow multiple streaming queries to run with same checkpoint (including concurrent runs of same query), so query should fail if it fails to write the metadata of specific batch ID due to same batch ID being written by others.\r\n\r\n2. commit log\r\n\r\nAs described in JIRA issue, assertion is already applied to the `offsetLog` for the same reason.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/8167714cab93a5c06c23f92c9077fe8b9677ab28/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/streaming/MicroBatchExecution.scala#L394-L402\r\n\r\nThis patch applied the same for commit log.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis prevents the inconsistent behavior on streaming query and lets query fail instead.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nN/A, as the change is simple and obvious, and it's really hard to artificially reproduce the issue.","created_at":"2019-09-29T15:44:37Z","updated_at":"2020-09-17T00:02:46Z","closed_at":"2020-09-17T00:01:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f2cd42008c62f5f7ac8ae2f71282cb75e8b7cd67","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n\r\nAdd `LaunchedExecuto`r message and send it to the driver when the executor if fully constructed, then the driver can assign the associated executor's totalCores to freeCores for making offers.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe executors send RegisterExecutor messages to the driver when onStart.\r\n\r\nThe driver put the executor data in “the ready to serve map” if it could be, then send RegisteredExecutor back to the executor.  The driver now can make an offer to this executor.\r\n\r\nBut the executor is not fully constructed yet. When it received RegisteredExecutor, it start to construct itself, initializing block manager, maybe register to the local shuffle server in the way of retrying, then start the heart beating to driver ... \r\n\r\nThe task allocated here may fail if the executor fails to start or cannot get heart beating to the driver in time.\r\n\r\nSometimes, even worse, when dynamic allocation and blacklisting is enabled and when the runtime executor number down to min executor setting, and those executors receive tasks before fully constructed and if any error happens, the application may be blocked or tear down.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNO\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n","created_at":"2019-09-29T08:53:50Z","updated_at":"2019-11-14T00:18:17Z","closed_at":"2019-11-14T00:14:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"38456178a5585782b230a4db2767cb2fbc54033c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhen adaptive execution is enabled, the Spark users who connected from JDBC always get adaptive execution error whatever the under root cause is. It's very confused. We have to check the driver log to find out why.\r\n```shell\r\n0: jdbc:hive2://localhost:10000> SELECT * FROM testData join testData2 ON key = v;\r\nSELECT * FROM testData join testData2 ON key = v;\r\nError: Error running query: org.apache.spark.SparkException: Adaptive execution failed due to stage materialization failures. (state=,code=0)\r\n0: jdbc:hive2://localhost:10000> \r\n```\r\n\r\nFor example, a job queried from JDBC failed due to HDFS missing block. User still get the error message `Adaptive execution failed due to stage materialization failures`.\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to reproduce is changing the code of `AdaptiveSparkPlanExec`, to let it throws out  an exception when it faces `StageSuccess`.\r\n```scala\r\n  case class AdaptiveSparkPlanExec(\r\n      events.drainTo(rem)\r\n         (Seq(nextMsg) ++ rem.asScala).foreach {\r\n           case StageSuccess(stage, res) =>\r\n//            stage.resultOption = Some(res)\r\n            val ex = new SparkException(\"Wrapper Exception\",\r\n              new IllegalArgumentException(\"Root cause is IllegalArgumentException for Test\"))\r\n            errors.append(\r\n              new SparkException(s\"Failed to materialize query stage: ${stage.treeString}\", ex))\r\n           case StageFailure(stage, ex) =>\r\n             errors.append(\r\n               new SparkException(s\"Failed to materialize query stage: ${stage.treeString}\", ex))\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo make the error message more user-friend and more useful for query from JDBC.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManually test query:\r\n```shell\r\n0: jdbc:hive2://localhost:10000> CREATE TEMPORARY VIEW testData (key, value) AS SELECT explode(array(1, 2, 3, 4)), cast(substring(rand(), 3, 4) as string);\r\nCREATE TEMPORARY VIEW testData (key, value) AS SELECT explode(array(1, 2, 3, 4)), cast(substring(rand(), 3, 4) as string);\r\n+---------+--+\r\n| Result  |\r\n+---------+--+\r\n+---------+--+\r\nNo rows selected (0.225 seconds)\r\n0: jdbc:hive2://localhost:10000> CREATE TEMPORARY VIEW testData2 (k, v) AS SELECT explode(array(1, 1, 2, 2)), cast(substring(rand(), 3, 4) as int);\r\nCREATE TEMPORARY VIEW testData2 (k, v) AS SELECT explode(array(1, 1, 2, 2)), cast(substring(rand(), 3, 4) as int);\r\n+---------+--+\r\n| Result  |\r\n+---------+--+\r\n+---------+--+\r\nNo rows selected (0.043 seconds)\r\n```\r\nBefore:\r\n```shell\r\n0: jdbc:hive2://localhost:10000> SELECT * FROM testData join testData2 ON key = v;\r\nSELECT * FROM testData join testData2 ON key = v;\r\nError: Error running query: org.apache.spark.SparkException: Adaptive execution failed due to stage materialization failures. (state=,code=0)\r\n0: jdbc:hive2://localhost:10000> \r\n```\r\nAfter:\r\n```shell\r\n0: jdbc:hive2://localhost:10000> SELECT * FROM testData join testData2 ON key = v;\r\nSELECT * FROM testData join testData2 ON key = v;\r\nError: Error running query: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Root cause is IllegalArgumentException for Test (state=,code=0)\r\n0: jdbc:hive2://localhost:10000>

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe `SET` commands do not contain the `_FUNC_` pattern a priori. In the PR, I propose filter out such commands in the `using _FUNC_ instead of function names in examples` test. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAfter the merge of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/25942, examples will require particular settings. Currently, the whole expression example has to be ignored which is so much. It makes sense to ignore only `SET` commands in expression examples.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nBy running the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes examples of Like/RLike to test its origin intention correctly. The example doesn't consider the default value of spark.sql.parser.escapedStringLiterals: it's false by default.\r\n\r\nPlease take a look at current example of Like:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/d72f39897b00d0bbd7a4db9de281a1256fcf908d/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/expressions/regexpExpressions.scala#L97-L106\r\n\r\nIf spark.sql.parser.escapedStringLiterals=false, then it should fail as there's `\\U` in pattern (spark.sql.parser.escapedStringLiterals=false by default) but it doesn't fail.\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe escape character is '\\'. If an escape character precedes a special symbol or another\r\nescape character, the following character is matched literally. It is invalid to escape\r\nany other character.\r\n``` \r\n\r\nFor the query \r\n\r\n```\r\nSET spark.sql.parser.escapedStringLiterals=false;\r\nSELECT '%SystemDrive%\\Users\\John' like '\\%SystemDrive\\%\\Users%';\r\n```\r\n\r\nSQL parser removes single `\\` (not sure that is intended) so the expressions of Like are constructed as following (I've printed out expression of left and right for Like/RLike):\r\n\r\n> LIKE - left `%SystemDrive%UsersJohn` / right `\\%SystemDrive\\%Users%`\r\n\r\nwhich are no longer having origin intention (see left).\r\n\r\nBelow query tests the origin intention:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSET spark.sql.parser.escapedStringLiterals=false;\r\nSELECT '%SystemDrive%\\\\Users\\\\John' like '\\%SystemDrive\\%\\\\\\\\Users%';\r\n```\r\n\r\n> LIKE - left `%SystemDrive%\\Users\\John` / right `\\%SystemDrive\\%\\\\Users%`\r\n\r\nNote that `\\\\\\\\` is needed in pattern as `StringUtils.escapeLikeRegex` requires `\\\\` to represent normal character of `\\`.\r\n\r\nSame for RLIKE: \r\n\r\n```\r\nSET spark.sql.parser.escapedStringLiterals=true;\r\nSELECT '%SystemDrive%\\Users\\John' rlike '%SystemDrive%\\\\Users.*';\r\n```\r\n\r\n> RLIKE - left `%SystemDrive%\\Users\\John` / right `%SystemDrive%\\\\Users.*`\r\n\r\nwhich is OK, but\r\n\r\n```\r\nSET spark.sql.parser.escapedStringLiterals=false;\r\nSELECT '%SystemDrive%\\Users\\John' rlike '%SystemDrive%\\Users.*';\r\n```\r\n\r\n> RLIKE - left `%SystemDrive%UsersJohn` / right `%SystemDrive%Users.*`\r\n\r\nwhich no longer haves origin intention.\r\n\r\nBelow query tests the origin intention:\r\n```\r\nSET spark.sql.parser.escapedStringLiterals=true;\r\nSELECT '%SystemDrive%\\\\Users\\\\John' rlike '%SystemDrive%\\\\\\\\Users.*';\r\n```\r\n\r\n> RLIKE - left `%SystemDrive%\\Users\\John` / right `%SystemDrive%\\\\Users.*`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nBecause the example doesn't test the origin intention. Spark is now running automated tests from these examples, so now it's not only documentation issue but also test issue.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, as it only corrects documentation.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded debug log (like above) and ran queries from `spark-sql`.","created_at":"2019-09-28T06:54:00Z","updated_at":"2020-02-05T18:26:10Z","closed_at":"2019-09-28T18:06:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"60ef603dc5883f3b80863b13bb3b0475288cb588","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25957/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25957/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/25957/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a87a75bd5ba495f8b6249849c6a2d2f15df59540","head":{"label":"HeartSaVioR:SPARK-29281","ref":"SPARK-29281","sha":"a87a75bd5ba495f8b6249849c6a2d2f15df59540","user":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":27994296,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzk5NDI5Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"HeartSaVioR/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to clone Spark session per-each expression example.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis adds a new rule, `V2ScanRelationPushDown`, to push filters and projections in to a new `DataSourceV2ScanRelation` in the optimizer. That scan is then used when converting to a physical scan node. The new relation correctly reports stats based on the scan.\r\n\r\nTo run scan pushdown before rules where stats are used, this adds a new optimizer override, `earlyScanPushDownRules` and a batch for early pushdown in the optimizer, before cost-based join reordering. The other early pushdown rule, `PruneFileSourcePartitions`, is moved into the early pushdown rule set.\r\n\r\nThis also moves pushdown helper methods from `DataSourceV2Strategy` into a util class.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis is needed for DSv2 sources to supply stats for cost-based rules in the optimizer.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis updates the implementation of stats from `DataSourceV2Relation` so tests will fail if stats are accessed before early pushdown for v2 relations.","created_at":"2019-09-28T01:28:18Z","updated_at":"2019-10-31T06:22:56Z","closed_at":"2019-10-31T01:07:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"99512468f59a561d3da7228006aa870313fb04e0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25955/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25955/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/25955/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c223e0537796c1e0a52bc5a655660f89ab539192","head":{"label":"rdblue:move-v2-pushdown","ref":"move-v2-pushdown","sha":"c223e0537796c1e0a52bc5a655660f89ab539192","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":26284539,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjI4NDUzOQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"rdblue/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWhen BytesToBytesMap cannot allocate a page, allocated page was freed by TaskMemoryManager. In this case, we should not keep it in longArray field of BytesToBytesMap. Otherwise it might be freed again in task completion listener of UnsafeFixedWidthAggregationMap and cause confusing error.\r\n\r\nNote that because we catch Throwable when invoking completion listeners, this error should not affect other listeners, except for the current listener. In the completion listener of UnsafeFixedWidthAggregationMap, it only performs BytesToBytesMap.free().\r\n\r\nBytesToBytesMap.free() does two things: freeing allocated pages and deleting spilled files. When it tries to free a freed page, this error hits and skips remaining pages (Executor.cleanUpAllAllocatedMemory will guard memory leak) and spilled files.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nBy chance, it is possibly that we free an already freed page in BytesToBytesMap. Because we have some guards when freeing a page, a confusing error would be hit:\r\n\r\n```\r\n16:07:33.550 ERROR org.apache.spark.TaskContextImpl: Error in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\navailableSlots are computed before the for loop looping over all TaskSets in resourceOffers. But the number of slots changes in every iteration, as in every iteration these slots are taken. The number of available slots checked by a barrier task set has therefore to be recomputed in every iteration from availableCpus.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nBugfix.\r\nThis could make resourceOffer attempt to start a barrier task set, even though it has not enough slots available. That would then be caught by the `require` in line 519, which will throw an exception, which will get caught and ignored by Dispatcher's MessageLoop, so nothing terrible would happen, but the exception would prevent resourceOffers from considering further TaskSets.\r\nNote that launching the barrier TaskSet can still fail if other requirements are not satisfied, and still can be rolled-back by throwing exception in this `require`. Handling it more gracefully remains a TODO in SPARK-24818, but this fix at least should resolve the situation when it's unable to launch because of insufficient slots.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded UT\r\n\r\nCloses

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhen implementing a ScanBuilder, we require the implementor to provide the schema of the data and the number of partitions.\r\n\r\nHowever, when someone is implementing WriteBuilder we only pass them the schema, but not the number of partitions. This is an asymetrical developer experience. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nPassing in the number of partitions on the WriteBuilder would enable data sources to provision their write targets before starting to write. For example:\r\n- it could be used to provision a Kafka topic with a specific number of partitions\r\n- it could be used to scale a microservice prior to sending the data to it\r\n- it could be used to create a DsV2 that sends the data to another spark cluster (currently not possible since the reader wouldn't be able to know the number of partitions)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nI ran the test, but I am getting an OOM error so I haven't been able to run the full suite.\r\n","created_at":"2019-09-26T15:46:31Z","updated_at":"2019-11-15T12:51:49Z","closed_at":"2019-11-15T12:51:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b66935abf155ab5928f3124932ebc01bdcdcbefd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25945/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/25945/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/25945/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f3dba5ea7823f593d4d75d933ffd2603ec75475f","head":{"label":"edrevo:add-partition-information","ref":"add-partition-information","sha":"f3dba5ea7823f593d4d75d933ffd2603ec75475f","user":{"login":"edrevo","id":1845771,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDU3NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1845771?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/edrevo","html_url":"https://github.com/edrevo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edrevo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edrevo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edrevo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edrevo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edrevo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edrevo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edrevo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edrevo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edrevo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21193678,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTE5MzY3OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"edrevo/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"edrevo","id":1845771,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDU3NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1845771?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/edrevo","html_url":"https://github.com/edrevo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edrevo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edrevo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edrevo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edrevo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edrevo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edrevo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edrevo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edrevo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edrevo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/edrevo/spark","description":"Mirror
