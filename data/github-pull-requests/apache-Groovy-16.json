of the way method selection works with overloaded methods, the position of params when applying `rcurry` is calculated lazily. E.g. for a method closure for the `foo` method, if there are two foo variants `foo(String, String)` and `foo(String, String, String)`, then right currying a single string parameter and supplying a single string argument will result in the `foo(String, String)` method being called but supplying two string arguments will call the 3 param variant to be called.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't make sense to do this for `ncurry` since a specific index is being supplied. I have clarified the documentation and implementation to capture those aspects of the current design and introduced some checking to avoid the AIOOBE when using `ncurry` when those assumptions are violated and instead throw an `IllegalArgumentException`.","created_at":"2017-10-02T01:31:19Z","updated_at":"2017-10-09T06:08:27Z","closed_at":"2017-10-09T06:08:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"44e47d86b10ff555b9ef98d737bda97a54278743","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/612/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/612/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/612/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/statuses/7419be6664fc1434d91949247970f7f1104b71b4","head":{"label":"paulk-asert:groovy8252","ref":"groovy8252","sha":"7419be6664fc1434d91949247970f7f1104b71b4","user":{"login":"paulk-asert","id":280016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MDAxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/280016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert","html_url":"https://github.com/paulk-asert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34248558,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDI0ODU1OA==","name":"groovy","full_name":"paulk-asert/groovy","private":false,"owner":{"login":"paulk-asert","id":280016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MDAxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/280016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert","html_url":"https://github.com/paulk-asert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/paulk-asert/groovy","description":"Mirror

address @blackdrag 's comment in the JIRA I created a JMH benchmark to test a volatile read vs a recheck and sync, https://github.com/jwagenleitner/testing-groovy/tree/master/issues/groovy8213.\r\n Based on my runs the volatile read is very close to a normal read. Doing a branched check (without needing to sync) was actually worse in terms of performance.\r\n\r\nIt seems with the `--parallel` feature in Gradle and builds being run on large many core servers this problem seems to be coming up more frequently. See https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/1420.\r\n\r\nWhile I do believe the publication of the `initialized` variable is an issue and should be addressed, another possible cause of this sort of problem could be related to the way the [`respondTo` methods are implemented by unsetting the `initialized` variable during a call to `super.initialize()` in the `loadMetaInfo() ` method](https://github.com/apache/groovy/blob/7b101dd98ffc04b1bfd2447bbe277340d8954add/src/main/org/codehaus/groovy/runtime/metaclass/ClosureMetaClass.java#L724-L740). But in this case and the referenced Gradle issue I'm not sure the `respondTo` methods are in play.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-10-01T03:06:40Z","updated_at":"2017-10-01T04:59:54Z","closed_at":"2017-10-01T04:48:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"149ac2764ae6b5d88abdd01e1e9198efa71e2582","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/609/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/609/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/609/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/statuses/01946dbf2bdd11bb1fa402131ba50fef26f889eb","head":{"label":"jwagenleitner:8213-Closure-Init-Threadsafe","ref":"8213-Closure-Init-Threadsafe","sha":"01946dbf2bdd11bb1fa402131ba50fef26f889eb","user":{"login":"jwagenleitner","id":97695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3Njk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/97695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner","html_url":"https://github.com/jwagenleitner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":36817367,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNjgxNzM2Nw==","name":"groovy","full_name":"jwagenleitner/groovy","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jwagenleitner","id":97695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3Njk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/97695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner","html_url":"https://github.com/jwagenleitner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwagenleitner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jwagenleitner/groovy","description":"Mirror

benchmark added:\r\n\r\nLegacy callsite caching:\r\n```\r\nBenchmark                                     Mode  Cnt     Score    Error   Units\r\nCallsiteBench.dispatch_1_monomorphic_groovy  thrpt   15

was added for 2.5.0 as part of [GROOVY-7572](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GROOVY-7572).  It appears it was originally placed there because at the time Java 6 was still used, but now 2.5.0 is 7+.\r\n\r\nFirst commit 91220015319 proposes moving the method (as-is) into the core `IOGroovyMethods` class.  This is where the `withCloseable(java.io.Closeable...)` method is located.  This change also moves the tests for both methods from NIO to core.  Since 2.5.0 has not been officially released there may not be a need to deprecate or worry about binary compatibility for the `withAutoCloseable` method?\r\n\r\nSecond commit 261bc174980d proposes to rename the new but unreleased method from `withAutoCloseable` to `withCloseable` to be consistent with the existing method on `java.io.Closeable`.
