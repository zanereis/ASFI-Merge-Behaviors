The fix might improve user experience with Spark SQL.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. The PR changes user-facing errors.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select cast(interval '10.123' second as decimal(1, 0));\r\n[NUMERIC_VALUE_OUT_OF_RANGE] 0.000010 cannot be represented

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to pass a query context in the `ElementAt` expression (`element_at` function) when the index is 0. For instance:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> set spark.sql.ansi.enabled=true;\r\nspark.sql.ansi.enabled\ttrue\r\nspark-sql> set spark.sql.error.messageFormat=standard;\r\nspark.sql.error.messageFormat\tstandard\r\nspark-sql> select element_at(array(1), 0);\r\n{\r\n  \"errorClass\" : \"ELEMENT_AT_BY_INDEX_ZERO\",\r\n  \"message\" : \"The index 0 is invalid. An index shall be either < 0 or > 0 (the first element has index 1).\",\r\n  \"messageParameters\" : { },\r\n  \"queryContext\" : [ {\r\n    \"objectType\" : \"\",\r\n    \"objectName\" : \"\",\r\n    \"startIndex\" : 8,\r\n    \"stopIndex\" : 30,\r\n    \"fragment\" : \"element_at(array(1), 0)\"\r\n  } ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo improve user experience with Spark SQL, and provide additional query contexts when the error happens.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the affected test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.SQLQueryTestSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *QueryExecutionErrorsSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis is one of the patches for SPARK-33235: Push-based Shuffle Improvement Tasks.\r\nAdded a class `PushMergeMetrics`, to collect below metrics from shuffle server side for Push-based shuffle:\r\n- no opportunity responses\r\n- too late responses\r\n- pushed bytes written\r\n- deferred block bytes\r\n- number of deferred blocks\r\n- stale block push requests\r\n- ignored block bytes\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis helps to understand the push based shuffle metrics from shuffle server side.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded a method `verifyMetrics` to verify those metrics in existing unit tests.\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-24T01:05:27Z","updated_at":"2023-01-12T06:55:42Z","closed_at":"2023-01-12T06:53:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cc53828081b74cf1bc8ee6d7597a1e707411613f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37638/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37638/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/37638/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5876ff690cdc70e1312543ef57e624129f03a18a","head":{"label":"linkedin:SPARK-33573-1","ref":"SPARK-33573-1","sha":"5876ff690cdc70e1312543ef57e624129f03a18a","user":{"login":"linkedin","id":357098,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjM1NzA5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/357098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin","html_url":"https://github.com/linkedin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":285879539,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODU4Nzk1Mzk=","name":"spark","full_name":"linkedin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"linkedin","id":357098,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjM1NzA5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/357098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin","html_url":"https://github.com/linkedin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/linkedin/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSupport NumPy ndarray in built-in functions(`pyspark.sql.functions`) by introducing Py4J input converter `NumpyArrayConverter`. The converter converts a ndarray to a Java array.\r\n\r\nThe mapping between ndarray dtype with Java primitive type is defined as below:\r\n```py\r\n            np.dtype(\"int64\"): gateway.jvm.long,\r\n            np.dtype(\"int32\"): gateway.jvm.int,\r\n            np.dtype(\"int16\"): gateway.jvm.short,\r\n            # Mapping to gateway.jvm.byte causes\r\n            #   TypeError: 'bytes' object does not support item assignment\r\n            np.dtype(\"int8\"): gateway.jvm.short,\r\n            np.dtype(\"float32\"): gateway.jvm.float,\r\n            np.dtype(\"float64\"): gateway.jvm.double,\r\n            np.dtype(\"bool\"): gateway.jvm.boolean,\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAs part of [SPARK-39405](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-39405) for NumPy support in SQL.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. NumPy ndarray is supported in built-in functions.\r\n\r\nTake `lit` for example,\r\n```py\r\n>>> spark.range(1).select(lit(np.array([1, 2], dtype='int16'))).dtypes\r\n[('ARRAY(1S, 2S)', 'array<smallint>')]\r\n>>> spark.range(1).select(lit(np.array([1, 2], dtype='int32'))).dtypes\r\n[('ARRAY(1, 2)', 'array<int>')]\r\n>>> spark.range(1).select(lit(np.array([1, 2], dtype='float32'))).dtypes\r\n[(\"ARRAY(CAST('1.0' AS FLOAT), CAST('2.0' AS FLOAT))\", 'array<float>')]\r\n>>> spark.range(1).select(lit(np.array([]))).dtypes\r\n[('ARRAY()', 'array<double>')]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis modifies `GenerateUnsafeProjection` to wrap projections of non-null fields in try-catch blocks which swallow any `NullPointerException` that is thrown, and instead throw a helpful error message indicating that a null value was encountered where the schema indicated non-null. This new error is added in `QueryExecutionErrors`.\r\n\r\nSmall modifications are made to a few methods in `GenerateUnsafeProjection` to allow for passing down the path to the projection in question, to give the user a helpful indication of what they need to change. Getting the name of the top-level column seems to require substantial changes since the name is thrown away when the `BoundReference` is created (in favor of an ordinal), so for the top-level only an ordinal is given; for nested fields the name is provided. An example error message looks like:\r\n\r\n```\r\njava.lang.RuntimeException: The value at <POS_0>.`middle`.`bottom` cannot be null, but a NULL was found. This is typically caused by the presence of a NULL value when the schema indicates the value should be non-null. Check that the input data matches the schema and/or that UDFs which can return null have a nullable return schema.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis is needed to help users decipher the error message; currently a `NullPointerException` without any message is thrown, which provides the user no guidance on what they've done wrong, and typically leads them to believe there is a bug in Spark. See the Jira for a specific example of how this behavior can be triggered and what the exception looks like currently.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, in the case that a user has a data-schema mismatch, they will not get a much more helpful error message. In other cases, no change.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nSee tests in `DataFrameSuite` and

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to enable the following two configurations by default. Note that these storage configurations are disabled by default by the parent configuration, `spark.storage.decommission.enabled`, still. In addition, all decommission features including this storage decommissioning are disabled by `spark.decommission.enabled` by default.\r\n- `spark.storage.decommission.rddBlocks.enabled`\r\n- `spark.storage.decommission.shuffleBlocks.enabled`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis will help users use the storage decommissioning feature more easily.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, this will reduce the number of required configurations for decommission users.\r\nHowever, these two configurations are disabled by two configurations still.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nSpecial case for `split` function when `regex` parameter is empty. The result will split input string but avoid empty remainder/tail string. I.e. `split('hello', '')` will produce `['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']` instead of `['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', '']`. Old behavior is preserved when `limit` parameter is explicitly set to negative value - `split('hello', '', -1)`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis is nice to have and matches intuitively expected behavior. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. \r\n- `split` function output changes when empty `regex` parameter is provided and `limit` parameter is not specified or set to 0. In this case a trailing empty string is ignored.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUnit tests.","created_at":"2022-08-23T22:22:36Z","updated_at":"2022-08-31T08:52:37Z","closed_at":"2022-08-31T08:52:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a631fe6cef6ed616d27b74b885b9f7c1e391c644","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37631/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37631/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/37631/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7f6c0ddfbe23a8d78efa466a0d4313b3c3f4a874","head":{"label":"vitaliili-db:SC-103756","ref":"SC-103756","sha":"7f6c0ddfbe23a8d78efa466a0d4313b3c3f4a874","user":{"login":"vitaliili-db","id":104398294,"node_id":"U_kgDOBjj91g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104398294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaliili-db","html_url":"https://github.com/vitaliili-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaliili-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaliili-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaliili-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaliili-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaliili-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaliili-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaliili-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaliili-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaliili-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":486365104,"node_id":"R_kgDOHP1XsA","name":"spark","full_name":"vitaliili-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vitaliili-db","id":104398294,"node_id":"U_kgDOBjj91g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104398294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaliili-db","html_url":"https://github.com/vitaliili-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaliili-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaliili-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaliili-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaliili-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaliili-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaliili-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaliili-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaliili-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaliili-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vitaliili-db/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAfter https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/32298 we were able to merge scalar subquery plans. This PR is a follow-up improvement to the merging logic to be able to combine `Filter` nodes with different conditions if those conditions can be merged in an ancestor `Aggregate` node. \r\n\r\nConsider the following query with 2 subqueries:\r\n```\r\nSELECT\r\n  (SELECT avg(a) FROM t WHERE c = 1)\r\n  (SELECT sum(a) FROM t WHERE c = 2)\r\n```\r\nwhere the subqueries can be merged to:\r\n```\r\nSELECT\r\n  avg(a) FILTER (WHERE c = 1),\r\n  sum(b) FILTER (WHERE c = 2)\r\nFORM t\r\nWHERE c = 1 OR c = 2\r\n```\r\nAfter this PR the 2 subqueries are merged to this optimized form:\r\n```\r\n== Optimized Logical Plan ==\r\nProject [scalar-subquery#260 [].avg(a) AS scalarsubquery()#277, scalar-subquery#261 [].sum(b) AS scalarsubquery()#278L]\r\n:  :- Project

`spark.sql.planMerge.filterPropagation.maxCost` to control how complex plans are allowed to be merged.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nPerformance improvement.\r\n```\r\n[info] TPCDS Snappy:

If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nNew case is added in Boolean simplification to convert condition of form (a==b) || (a==null&&b==null) to a<=>b.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIf the join condition is like key1==key2 || (key1==null && key2==null), join is executed as Broadcast Nested Loop Join as this condition doesn't satisfy equi join condition. BNLJ takes more time as compared to Sort merge or broadcast hash join. This condition can be converted to key1<=>key2 to make the join execute as Broadcast or sort merge join. It will improve the performance of queries which have join with condition which matches this pattern.\r\n\r\nSample query: \r\nval dfAns = df.join(df1, (df(\"v\")===df1(\"x\") or (isnull(df(\"v\")) and isnull(df1(\"x\")))), \"leftanti\")\r\n\r\nPlan before change\r\nOptimizedPlan:\r\nJoin LeftAnti, ((v#1 = x#15) || (isnull(v#1) && isnull(x#15)))\r\n:- LocalRelation [g#0, v#1, o#2, x#3]\r\n+- LocalRelation [x#15]\r\n\r\ndfAns.queryExecution.executedPlan\r\n*(1) BroadcastNestedLoopJoin BuildRight, LeftAnti, ((v#256 = x#270) || (isnull(v#256) && isnull(x#270)))\r\n:- LocalTableScan [g#255, v#256, o#257, x#258]\r\n+- BroadcastExchange IdentityBroadcastMode, [id=#91]\r\n   +- LocalTableScan [x#270]\r\n\r\nPlan after change\r\nOptimizedPlan\r\nJoin LeftAnti, (v#29 <=> x#79)\r\n:- LocalRelation [g#28, v#29, o#30, x#31]\r\n+- LocalRelation [x#79]\r\n\r\nExecutedPlan\r\n*(1) BroadcastHashJoin [coalesce(v#29, 0), isnull(v#29)], [coalesce(x#71, 0), isnull(x#71)], LeftAnti, BuildRight\r\n:- LocalTableScan [g#28, v#29, o#30, x#31]\r\n+- BroadcastExchange HashedRelationBroadcastMode(ArrayBuffer(coalesce(input[0, int, false], 0), isnull(input[0, int, false]))), [id=#57]\r\n   +- LocalTableScan [x#71]\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAQE can not completely respect the user-specified repartition. The main reasons are:\r\n\r\n1. the AQE optimzier will convert empty to local relation which does not reserve the partitioning info\r\n2. the machine of AQE `requiredDistribution` only restore the repartition which does not support through `DeserializeToObjectExec`\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the fix:\r\nThe partition number of `spark.range(0).repartition(5).rdd.getNumPartitions` should be 5.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nyes, ensure the user-specified distribution.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis is a extended work of SPARK-38909, in this pr, the `RocksDB` implementation is added for shuffle local state store.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the following code:\r\n- `shuffledb.RocksDB` and `shuffledb.RocksDBIterator`: implementation of RocksDB corresponding to `shuffledb.DB` and `shuffledb.DBIterator`\r\n- Add `ROCKSDB` to shuffle.DBBackend and the corresponding file suffix is `.rdb` and the description of `SHUFFLE_SERVICE_DB_BACKEND` in also changed\r\n- Add `RocksDBProvider` to build `RocksDB` instance and extend `DBProvider` to produce corresponding instances\r\n- Add dependency of `rocksdbjni` to `network-common` module\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSupport shuffle local state store to use RocksDB\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nWhen user configures `spark.shuffle.service.db.enabled` as true, the user can use rocksdb as the shuffle lcoal state store by specifying `SHUFFLE_SERVICE_DB_BACKEND(spark.shuffle.service.db.backend)` as `RocksDB` in `spark-default.conf` or `spark-shuffle-site.xml(for yarn)`.\r\n\r\nThe original data store in `LevelDB/RocksDB` will not be automatically convert to another kind of storage now.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd new test.\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-22T08:06:49Z","updated_at":"2022-09-09T05:33:27Z","closed_at":"2022-09-09T02:06:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"462c33ff3ade6b0bca2912987be536fd1f0c859e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1427970157,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDI3OTcwMTU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/YARN","name":"YARN","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37610/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37610/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/37610/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/52c1c7e11b98784ab695afe64d5bb5e519a7fcd5","head":{"label":"LuciferYang:SPARK-38888","ref":"SPARK-38888","sha":"52c1c7e11b98784ab695afe64d5bb5e519a7fcd5","user":{"login":"LuciferYang","id":1475305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1475305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang","html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":104327447,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDQzMjc0NDc=","name":"spark","full_name":"LuciferYang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"LuciferYang","id":1475305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1475305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang","html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to change the result type of the `PercentileBase` (the `Percentile`, `PercentileDisc`, `Median`, `PercentileCont` expressions):\r\n- For any year-month interval types return `YEAR TO MONTH INTERVAL`\r\n- For any day-time interval types return `DAY TO SECOND INTERVAL`\r\n\r\nThe PR changes behavior of the following functions: `median()`, `percentile()`, `percentile_cont()` and `percentile_disc()`.\r\n\r\nThis PR is a follow up of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/36965.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. To not loose the fraction part of the result when it is possible. To behave in the same way as for numeric types when the functions return double.\r\n2. To be consistent with `MEAN` which returns wide ANSI types, for instance:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> SELECT typeof(mean(distinct cast(col as interval hour))) FROM VALUES (1), (2), (2), (3), (4), (NULL) AS tab(col);\r\ninterval day to second\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> SELECT typeof(median(distinct cast(col as interval hour))) FROM VALUES (1), (2), (2), (3), (4), (NULL) AS tab(col);\r\ninterval hour\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> SELECT typeof(median(distinct cast(col as interval hour))) FROM VALUES (1), (2), (2), (3), (4), (NULL) AS tab(col);\r\ninterval day to second\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running new tests:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.SQLQueryTestSuite -- -z percentiles.sql\"\r\n```","created_at":"2022-08-21T07:01:01Z","updated_at":"2022-08-22T08:11:17Z","closed_at":"2022-08-22T08:11:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"65cdf0b22316a77b7ff5a34327cb7deb9a2c6ea9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37595/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37595/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/37595/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3267d9431618e53ec2c6b1f6744da4c152b9fc83","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:median-result-ansi-intervals","ref":"median-result-ansi-intervals","sha":"3267d9431618e53ec2c6b1f6744da4c152b9fc83","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAggregates should be group only if all aggregate expressions are the same as grouping expressions , or aliases of grouping expressions. But when we call `dataFrame.show()`, sparkSql will cast non-binaryType column to StringType column, and then CollapseProject rule will push them into the aggregate expressions, so the aggregate should also be group only if the aggregate expressions are cast from grouping expressions.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor example, the optimize plan of `testData.distinct().select('key.cast(\"string\"), 'value)` is\r\n```java\r\nProject [cast(key#3 as string) AS key#10, value#4]\r\n+- Deduplicate [key#3, value#4]\r\n   +- SerializeFromObject [knownnotnull(assertnotnull(input[0, org.apache.spark.sql.test.SQLTestData$TestData, true])).key AS key#3, staticinvoke(class org.apache.spark.unsafe.types.UTF8String, StringType, fromString, knownnotnull(assertnotnull(input[0, org.apache.spark.sql.test.SQLTestData$TestData, true])).value, true, false, true) AS value#4]\r\n      +- ExternalRDD [obj#2]\r\n```\r\nit should be group only.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSmall improvement,  make the groupOnly method of Aggregate support cast expressions.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded UT\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-21T03:37:30Z","updated_at":"2022-08-24T08:56:23Z","closed_at":"2022-08-24T08:56:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0a620f1c258970a7ad4e0a307929c7e6fd13b881","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37594/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37594/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/37594/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ef0872065139d722aca956e84583af86ee3163d3","head":{"label":"wankunde:SPARK-40159","ref":"SPARK-40159","sha":"ef0872065139d722aca956e84583af86ee3163d3","user":{"login":"wankunde","id":3626747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MjY3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3626747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde","html_url":"https://github.com/wankunde","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":260172941,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjAxNzI5NDE=","name":"spark","full_name":"wankunde/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wankunde","id":3626747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MjY3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3626747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde","html_url":"https://github.com/wankunde","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wankunde/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wankunde/spark","description":"Apache

In spark, it is only an intermediate property.\r\n##### (B).In the original logic (commitId: f479cf3743e416ee08e62806e1b34aff5998ac22)\r\nCompatible with the legacy parquet version is SPARK_METADATA_KEY - org.apache.spark.sql.parquet.row.metadata(save in parquet footer metadata), but not SPARK_ROW_SCHEMA - org.apache.spark.sql.parquet.row.attributes\r\n<img width=\"537\"

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1. Respect the SQL config `spark.sql.error.messageFormat` introduced by https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/37520, and output error messages in the one of format: `PRETTY` (by default), `MINIMAL` or `STANDARD`.\r\n2. In the `PRETTY` format, output the error message of the `AnalysisException` exception in the same way as for other exceptions, i. e. w/o `Error in query:`.\r\n3. Take into account the `silent` CLI option, and output the call stack only when it is `false`.\r\n\r\nIn the `MINIMAL` and `STANDARD` formats don't print the call stack independently from the `silent` mode. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo respect the SQL config `spark.sql.error.messageFormat` and to be consistent to error outputs of the Thrift Server. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nThe PR changes the behavior for `AnalysisException`. In that case, `spark-sql` does not output the prefix: `Error in query:` by default (format is PRETTY).\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> DROP TABLE ajhkdha;\r\nError in query: Table or view not found: ajhkdha; line 1 pos 11;\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> DROP TABLE ajhkdha;\r\nTable or view not found: ajhkdha; line 1 pos 11;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nJVM path default use JAVA_HOME\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn Spark 3.0 standalone mode, unable to customize driver JVM path, instead the JAVA_HOME of the spark-submit submission machine is used, but the JVM paths of my submission machine and the cluster machine are different.\r\n\r\nIn standalone mode, javaHome always empty, so always take childEnv.get(\"JAVA_HOME\")\r\n\r\n```java\r\nList<String> buildJavaCommand(String extraClassPath) throws IOException {\r\n  List<String> cmd = new ArrayList<>();\r\n\r\n  String firstJavaHome = firstNonEmpty(javaHome,\r\n    childEnv.get(\"JAVA_HOME\"),\r\n    System.getenv(\"JAVA_HOME\"),\r\n    System.getProperty(\"java.home\")); \r\n```\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to:

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently,  for the following query it behaves differently between ansi mode and non-ansi mode:\r\n```\r\n-- ANSI on\r\n> select cast('1.2' as int) \r\nCAST_INVALID_INPUT ERROR\r\n```\r\n```\r\n-- ANSI off\r\n> select cast('1.2' as int) \r\n1\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe change was introduced in https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/ac262cb27255f989f6a6dd864bd5114a928b96da. With the change, we can avoid the following query returning true under ANSI mode\r\n```\r\n-- with ANSI on, both '1.2' and 1 will be cast as long type\r\nselect '1.2' = 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, the fraction strings should be allowed as per the SQL standard\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1097932/185539714-9ed552e9-3a3a-4be1-b3b0-67d74c2b645e.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1097932/185539751-fa019c97-4c0e-418c-af4f-910309236a35.png)\r\n\r\nThis PR is to change the syntax for explicit casting to allow converting fraction strings as integral types. If the cast is implicit(not an explicit cast from SQL query), then it remains unchanged.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo be more compliant with the SQL standard. Also, explicit casting string as integral types is now more consistent between the ANSI mode and the non-ANSI mode.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, it allows explicitly casting fraction strings as Integral types in ANSI mode.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to improve the examples in `pyspark.sql.functions` by making each example self-contained with a brief explanation and a bit more realistic example.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the first 25 functions in `pyspark.sql.functions` because the number of functions is too large.\r\n\r\nThis PR also additionally removes `since` because we won't need this when we have the complete examples and parameters.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo make the documentation more readable and able to copy and paste directly in PySpark shell.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, it changes the documentation\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually ran each doctests. CI also runs

If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`TaskContext` currently defines two sets of functions for registering listeners:\r\n```scala\r\ndef addTaskCompletionListener(listener: TaskCompletionListener): TaskContext\r\ndef addTaskCompletionListener[U](f: (TaskContext) => U): TaskContext\r\n\r\ndef addTaskFailureListener(listener: TaskFailureListener): TaskContext\r\ndef addTaskFailureListener(f: (TaskContext, Throwable) => Unit): TaskContext\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore JDK8 and scala-2.12, the overloads were a convenient way to register a new listener without having to instantiate a new class. However, with the introduction of [functional interfaces](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/lambdaexpressions.html#approach5) in JDK8+, and subsequent [SAM support](https://www.scala-lang.org/news/2.12.0/) in scala-2.12, the two function signatures are now equivalent because a function whose signature matches the only method of a functional interface can be used in place of that interface. \r\n\r\nResult: cryptic ambiguous overload errors when trying to use the function-only overload, which prompted a [scala bug report](https://github.com/scala/bug/issues/11016) (which was never addressed), as well as an attempted workaround that makes `addTaskCompletionListener` gratuitously generic, so that the compiler no longer considers e.g. `addTaskCompletionListener[Unit]` as equivalent to the overload that accepts a `TaskFailureListener`. The latter workaround was never applied to `addTaskFailureListener` for some reason. \r\n\r\nNow that scala-2.12 on JDK8 is the minimum supported version, we can dispense with the overloads and rely entirely on language SAM support to work as expected. The vast majority of call sites can now use the function form instead of the class form, which simplifies the code considerably.\r\n\r\nWhile we're at it, standardize the call sites. One-liners use the functional form:\r\n```scala\r\naddTaskCompletionListener(_ => ...)\r\n```\r\nwhile multi-liners use the block form:\r\n```scala\r\naddTaskCompletionListener { _ =>\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nScala SAM feature conflicts with the existing overloads. The task listener interface becomes simpler and easier to use if we align with the language.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nDevelopers who rely on this developer API will need to remove the gratuitous `[Unit]` when registering functions as listeners.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAll use sites in the spark code base have been updated to use the new mechanism. The fact that they continue to compile is the strongest evidence that the change worked. The tests that exercise the changed code sites also verify correctness.

they use `.html` extension instead of `.mustache`.\r\nKerberised yarn applies auth filter twice on `.html` files causing `Request is a replay (34)`. This leads to blank pages in Spark UI and users are mostly left with a lot of guess work. Changing it to correct `.mustache` makes it render correctly as a welcome change.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nfor kerberised clusters, the executors and stages pages should start working again.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTwo ways: \r\n- Ran spark locally and in kerberised cluster with and without knox. verify that it works. ✅\r\n- Test cases in this

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to change implementation of `fragment` in `SQLQueryContext` to get the fragment correctly. Before the changes, `fragment` misses the last char because `originStopIndex.get` points to the last char of fragments but `substring()` gets a sub-string up to `endIndex - 1`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIt fixes a bug.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running new test suite:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt

If the `Dataset` is already a limit job, this will introduce an extra shuffle phase. So we should combine the limit after projection.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```scala\r\nspark.sql(\"select * from spark.store_sales limit 10\").show()\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\nAdaptiveSparkPlan (12)\r\n+- == Final Plan ==\r\n   * Project (7)\r\n   +- * GlobalLimit (6)\r\n      +- ShuffleQueryStage (5), Statistics(sizeInBytes=185.6 KiB, rowCount=990)\r\n         +- Exchange (4)\r\n            +- * LocalLimit (3)\r\n               +- * ColumnarToRow (2)\r\n                  +- Scan parquet spark_catalog.spark.store_sales (1)\r\n+- == Initial Plan ==\r\n   Project (11)\r\n   +- GlobalLimit (10)\r\n      +- Exchange (9)\r\n         +- LocalLimit (8)\r\n            +- Scan parquet spark_catalog.spark.store_sales (1)\r\n```\r\nAfter:\r\n```\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\nCollectLimit (4)\r\n+- * Project (3)\r\n   +- * ColumnarToRow (2)\r\n      +- Scan parquet spark_catalog.spark.store_sales (1)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n1. param `data` accepts `ps.DataFrame`, since `pd.DataFrame(...)` also accepts another `pd.DataFrame` as a `data` param;\r\n2. when `data` is distributed (`InternalFrame`/`SparkDataFrame`/`ps.DataFrame`/`ps.Series`), apply `combine_frames` to combine `data` and `index`;\r\n3. when `data` is a local data (`pd.DataFrame`/list/...), directly collect `index`, and apply `pd.DataFrame(...)` internally\r\n- 3.1 `index` should be small, when `data` fits in memory\r\n- 3.2 `combine_frames` can not work with a multi-index for now\r\n- 3.3 most important, to make sure queries like `ps.DataFrame([1, 2], index=ps.Index([1, 2]))` returns same result with `pd.DataFrame([1, 2], index=pd.Index([1, 2]))`, if we apply `combine_frames` in this case, then the results will be different\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nto support `index` in DataFrame creation\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, `ps.Index` is supported\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nadded

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSupport NumPy scalars in built-in functions by introducing Py4J input converter `NumpyScalarConverter`.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, \r\n- `np.int8, np.int16, np.int32, np.int64` are mapped to Spark `int/bigint`.\r\n- `np.float32, np.float64` are mapped to Spark `double`.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that 2147483648 is the boundary between Spark `int` and `bigint`:\r\n```py\r\n>>> df.select(lit(np.int64(max_int + 1))).dtypes\r\n[('2147483648', 'bigint')]\r\n>>> df.select(lit(np.int64(max_int))).dtypes\r\n[('2147483647', 'int')]\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAs part of [SPARK-39405](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-39405) for NumPy support in SQL.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. NumPy scalars are supported in built-in functions when input parameter accepts scalars;\r\nInfluenced functions include `lit`, `when`, `array_contains`, `array_position`, `element_at`, `array_remove`.\r\n\r\nTake `lit` for example,\r\n```py\r\n>>> df.select(lit(np.int8(1))).dtypes\r\n[('1', 'int')]\r\n>>> df.select(lit(np.float32(1))).dtypes\r\n[('1.0', 'double')]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests.\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-18T00:45:16Z","updated_at":"2022-08-25T18:33:08Z","closed_at":"2022-08-25T18:30:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b0ba48f598a04e0d2f433f4ad2f5c87807754f65","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37560/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37560/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/37560/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3a826ef54814234b98818ce915db9f124de19d85","head":{"label":"xinrong-meng:builtin_np","ref":"builtin_np","sha":"3a826ef54814234b98818ce915db9f124de19d85","user":{"login":"xinrong-meng","id":47337188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzM3MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47337188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng","html_url":"https://github.com/xinrong-meng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":335786381,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzU3ODYzODE=","name":"spark","full_name":"xinrong-meng/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xinrong-meng","id":47337188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzM3MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47337188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng","html_url":"https://github.com/xinrong-meng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xinrong-meng/spark","description":"Apache

of #36546\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nChange `TemporalSequenceImpl` to pass a time-zone aware value to `DateTimeUtils#timestampAddInterval`, rather than a time-zone agnostic value, when performing `Date` arithmetic.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe following query gets the wrong answer if run in the America/Los_Angeles time zone:\r\n```\r\nspark-sql> select sequence(date '2021-01-01', date '2022-01-01', interval '3' month) x;\r\n[2021-01-01,2021-03-31,2021-06-30,2021-09-30,2022-01-01]\r\nTime taken: 0.664 seconds, Fetched 1 row(s)\r\nspark-sql>\r\n```\r\nThe answer should be\r\n```\r\n[2021-01-01,2021-04-01,2021-07-01,2021-10-01,2022-01-01]\r\n```\r\n`TemporalSequenceImpl` converts the date to micros by multiplying days by micros per day. This converts the date into a time-zone agnostic timestamp. However, `TemporalSequenceImpl` uses `DateTimeUtils#timestampAddInterval` to perform the arithmetic, and that function assumes a _time-zone aware_ timestamp.\r\n\r\nThis PR converts the date to a time-zone aware value before calling `DateTimeUtils#timestampAddInterval`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit test.","created_at":"2022-08-17T23:03:21Z","updated_at":"2022-11-28T00:56:06Z","closed_at":"2022-08-18T20:04:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"533dfac6721e534f995c3d5d7c1dbf3af1f71fb6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37559/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37559/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/37559/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/79e5f57f9d8abc8463fa936fda1102530ce9e2b1","head":{"label":"bersprockets:date_sequence_issue_31","ref":"date_sequence_issue_31","sha":"79e5f57f9d8abc8463fa936fda1102530ce9e2b1","user":{"login":"bersprockets","id":21131848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTMxODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21131848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets","html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":115567071,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTU1NjcwNzE=","name":"spark","full_name":"bersprockets/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bersprockets","id":21131848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTMxODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21131848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets","html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe PR implements a mechanism to get credentials for a cloud service like AWS from an external credentials provider, and share the credentials between the driver and executors.\r\n\r\nThere are two commits. The first implements the feature by implementing the same mechanism as Kerberos delegation tokens. The second refactors the code and merges the two implementations. Keeping the two commits separate to make it easier to follow the changes.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFor large scale deployments of Spark accessing data from cloud services like AWS/S3, every executor in every Spark job needs to have access to credentials. These can be provided on the command line when the job is launched(not entirely secure), however, if the job continues for a longer period, the credentials may expire and need to be renewed. If every executor gets new credentials from the external service then a stampeding herd situation might cause disruption of the credentials provider service. This PR implements a mechanism such that the credentials are obtained once at startup and then again before expiry and distributed to executors.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nThere are new configuration parameters documented in the README.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests and manual testing in a user environment.","created_at":"2022-08-17T20:14:58Z","updated_at":"2023-01-01T00:21:21Z","closed_at":"2023-01-01T00:21:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0660996249e3919398ce7dac1c247e0920c55f74","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37558/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37558/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/37558/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f156641bca3b4c8eb794c0a47b9f4edcedaeb5f8","head":{"label":"parthchandra:SPARK-38954-PR","ref":"SPARK-38954-PR","sha":"f156641bca3b4c8eb794c0a47b9f4edcedaeb5f8","user":{"login":"parthchandra","id":6529136,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MjkxMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6529136?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra","html_url":"https://github.com/parthchandra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":187921479,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODc5MjE0Nzk=","name":"spark","full_name":"parthchandra/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"parthchandra","id":6529136,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MjkxMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6529136?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra","html_url":"https://github.com/parthchandra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthchandra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/parthchandra/spark","description":"Apache

Now reads the encoding same as if vectorized reads are disabled.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded test case to ParquetIOSuite; made sure it fails without the fix to VectorizedColumnReader and passes after.\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-17T17:20:55Z","updated_at":"2022-08-18T02:43:53Z","closed_at":"2022-08-17T23:21:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d360c8d09bfc95cdc4f14b738584b112ab111b73","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37557/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/37557/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/37557/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a45d1e40de705804a5e18d44f1a92b39181f18fa","head":{"label":"sfc-gh-dhuo:support-parquet-delta-length-byte-array","ref":"support-parquet-delta-length-byte-array","sha":"a45d1e40de705804a5e18d44f1a92b39181f18fa","user":{"login":"sfc-gh-dhuo","id":99215334,"node_id":"U_kgDOBenn5g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99215334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-dhuo","html_url":"https://github.com/sfc-gh-dhuo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-dhuo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-dhuo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-dhuo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-dhuo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-dhuo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-dhuo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-dhuo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-dhuo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-dhuo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":525588418,"node_id":"R_kgDOH1PXwg","name":"spark","full_name":"sfc-gh-dhuo/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sfc-gh-dhuo","id":99215334,"node_id":"U_kgDOBenn5g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99215334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-dhuo","html_url":"https://github.com/sfc-gh-dhuo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-dhuo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-dhuo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-dhuo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-dhuo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-dhuo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-dhuo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-dhuo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-dhuo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-dhuo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sfc-gh-dhuo/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR switches the deprecated API `write_arrow(..., raw())` to use `write_to_raw`. This is exactly the same behaviour/replacement.\r\n\r\nSee also:\r\n- https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/news/index.html#reading-and-writing-9-0-0 for `write_arrow`\r\n- https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/news/index.html#feather-v2-0-17-0 for `write_to_raw`.\r\n- https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/apache-arrow-8.0.0/r/R/deprecated.R#L31-L40 for deprecated implementation of `write_arrow`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`write_arrow` is removed out from Arrow 9.0.0 in R Array library.\r\n\r\nNote that `write_to_raw` has existed from Arrow 0.17.0 so I expect this is a safe change.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, users can use R Arrow 9.0.0.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nCi in this PR should test it

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis adds `sortWithinGroups` (similar to `Dataset.sortWithinPartitions`) to `KeyValueGroupedDataset` (returned by `Dataset.groupByKey()`).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis allows existing methods `flatMapGroups` and `cogroup` to provide a **sorted** iterator of rows for each group key. User code then does not need to sort the groups if their algorithm requires ordered groups (e.g. temporal / as-of joins).\r\n\r\nSorting the entire group inside `flatMapGroups` / `cogroup` requires materialising all rows, which is against the idea of an iterator in the first place. Methods `flatMapGroups` and `cogroup` have the great advantage that they work with groups that are _too large to fit into memory of one executor_. Sorting them in the user function breaks this property.\r\n\r\n[org.apache.spark.sql.KeyValueGroupedDataset](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/47485a3c2df3201c838b939e82d5b26332e2d858/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/KeyValueGroupedDataset.scala#L134-L137):\r\n> Internally, the implementation will spill to disk if any given group is too large to fit into\r\n> memory.  However, users must take care to avoid materializing the whole iterator for a group\r\n> (for example, by calling `toList`) unless they are sure that this is possible given the memory\r\n> constraints of their cluster.\r\n\r\nThe implementations of `KeyValueGroupedDataset.flatMapGroups` and `KeyValueGroupedDataset.cogroup` already sort each partition according to the group key. By additionally sorting by some data columns, the iterator can be guaranteed to provide some order.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nThis adds `KeyValueGroupedDataset.sortWithinGroups`, which has side effects on existing methods `KeyValueGroupedDataset.flatMapGroups` and `KeyValueGroupedDataset.cogroup`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTests have been added to

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR:\r\n- Adds `ghcr.io/apache/spark/apache-spark-github-action-image-cache:${{ inputs.branch }}-lint` for lint job, it will be used for master/branches/master shedule job.\r\n- Adds `ghcr.io/apache/spark/apache-spark-github-action-image-cache:${{ github.ref_name }}-lint` to speed up lint image build and make lint image as static image.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo aovid the issue like https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/37243#issuecomment-1191422150 , we had some initial discussion, we'd better move infra image into lint image to make lint deps static and upgrade manually. And also save about 15 mins for each lint job.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, dev only\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nCI
