What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to assign the proper name `UNSUPPORTED_TYPED_LITERAL ` to the legacy error class `_LEGACY_ERROR_TEMP_0021 `, and modify test suite to use `checkError()` which checks the error class name, context and etc.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nProper name improves user experience w/ Spark SQL.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, the PR changes an user-facing error message. \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the modified test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ PYSPARK_PYTHON=python3 build/sbt \"sql/testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.SQLQueryTestSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *ExpressionParserSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly

If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nWhen the value of quote or escape exists in the content of csv file, the character in the csv file will be misidentified\r\nWe found that when the value of quote or escape exists in the content of csv file, the character in the csv file will be misidentified. \r\nWhen this content is being read by Azure Data Factory copy activity and written to CSV, the content is \r\n\"test\\\\\\\\\" =\r\ntest\"\r\nwe read csv as below: \r\ndf = spark.read.csv(path='test.csv'\r\n                             , sep=','\r\n                             , header=True\r\n                             , quote='\"'\r\n                             , escape='\\\\'\r\n                             , multiLine=True\r\n                             , lineSep='\\n'\r\n                            )\r\n resulting in the following being written to the CSV:  **test\\\\\" =** and **test** in the next line ,but what we want  **test\\\\\\\\\" = test**.\r\nNow when the above is being read by Spark: \r\n1. The first \\ is being interpreted as being an escaping of the second \\ (so the content looks like a single literal \\) \r\n2. The \" now appears to be an unescaped quote character, so we're back in the situation where Spark tries to handle this using STOP_AT_DELIMITER. \r\nAs before, the rest of the CSV after this point is being parsed incorrectly. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nWe could change the \"quote,escape...\" to avoid it for the scenario above, but the content of their csv file is very large and it may occur any character. the data sources that we have which are affected by this issue are systems outside of our control, so we have no means of controlling what content/characters will be there.When we change the \"quote,escape...\", it may conflict with the content again, and it still have issues in the following content. \r\nAs far as designing the content to avoid certain characters - the data sources that we have which are affected by this issue are systems outside of our control, so we have no means of controlling what content/characters will be there. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUnit test.\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-10-31T07:48:07Z","updated_at":"2022-11-01T05:02:29Z","closed_at":"2022-11-01T03:35:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1405801475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/ML","name":"ML","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1405803268,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAzMjY4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/MLLIB","name":"MLLIB","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen creating the project list for the new projection In `ExtractGenerator`, take into account whether the generator is outer when setting nullable on generator-related output attributes.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes an issue that can produce either incorrect results or a `NullPointerException`. It's a bit of an obscure issue in that I am hard-pressed to reproduce without using a subquery that has a inline table.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```\r\nselect c1, explode(c4) as c5 from (\r\n  select c1, array(c3) as c4 from (\r\n    select c1, explode_outer(c2) as c3\r\n    from values\r\n    (1, array(1, 2)),\r\n    (2, array(2, 3)),\r\n    (3, null)\r\n    as data(c1, c2)\r\n  )\r\n);\r\n\r\n+---+---+\r\n|c1 |c5 |\r\n+---+---+\r\n|1  |1  |\r\n|1  |2  |\r\n|2  |2  |\r\n|2  |3  |\r\n|3  |0  |\r\n+---+---+\r\n```\r\nIn the last row, `c5` is 0, but should be `NULL`.\r\n\r\nAnother example:\r\n```\r\nselect c1, exists(c4, x -> x is null) as c5 from (\r\n  select c1, array(c3) as c4 from (\r\n    select c1, explode_outer(c2) as c3\r\n    from values\r\n    (1, array(1, 2)),\r\n    (2, array(2, 3)),\r\n    (3, array())\r\n    as data(c1, c2)\r\n  )\r\n);\r\n\r\n+---+-----+\r\n|c1 |c5   |\r\n+---+-----+\r\n|1  |false|\r\n|1  |false|\r\n|2  |false|\r\n|2  |false|\r\n|3  |false|\r\n+---+-----+\r\n```\r\nIn the last row, `false` should be `true`.\r\n\r\nIn both cases, at the time `CreateArray(c3)` is instantiated, `c3`'s nullability is incorrect because the new projection created by `ExtractGenerator` uses `generatorOutput` from `explode_outer(c2)` as a projection list. `generatorOutput` doesn't take into account that `explode_outer(c2)` is an _outer_ explode, so the nullability setting is lost.\r\n\r\n`UpdateAttributeNullability` will eventually fix the nullable setting for attributes referring to `c3`, but it doesn't fix the `containsNull` setting for `c4` in `explode(c4)` (from the first example) or `exists(c4, x -> x is null)` (from the second example).\r\n\r\nThis example fails with a `NullPointerException`:\r\n```\r\nselect c1, inline_outer(c4) from (\r\n  select c1, array(c3) as c4 from (\r\n    select c1, explode_outer(c2) as c3\r\n    from values\r\n    (1, array(named_struct('a', 1, 'b', 2))),\r\n    (2, array(named_struct('a', 3, 'b', 4), named_struct('a', 5, 'b', 6))),\r\n    (3, array())\r\n    as data(c1, c2)\r\n  )\r\n);\r\n22/10/30 17:34:42 ERROR

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to migrate `failAnalysis()` errors onto temporary error classes with the prefix `_LEGACY_ERROR_TEMP_23xx`. The error message will not include the error classes, so, in this way we will preserve the existing behaviour.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe migration on temporary error classes allows to gather statistics about errors and detect most popular error classes. After that we could prioritise the work on migration.\r\n\r\nThe new error class name prefix `_LEGACY_ERROR_TEMP_` proposed here kind of marks the error as developer-facing, not user-facing. Developers can still get the error class programmatically via the `SparkThrowable` interface, so that they can build error infra with it. End users won't see the error class in the message. This allows us to do the error migration very quickly, and we can refine the error classes and mark them as user-facing later (naming them properly, adding tests, etc.).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo. The error messages should be almost the same by default.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the affected test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ PYSPARK_PYTHON=python3 build/sbt \"sql/testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.SQLQueryTestSuite\"\r\n```","created_at":"2022-10-29T16:50:19Z","updated_at":"2022-10-31T06:08:30Z","closed_at":"2022-10-31T06:08:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a10ea80e7d6f49e2c7091cae9c51ca182533a3a6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38436/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38436/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/38436/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8df3b02d15aee377e2923939a59747de0d5ea8eb","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:legacy-error-class-failAnalysis","ref":"legacy-error-class-failAnalysis","sha":"8df3b02d15aee377e2923939a59747de0d5ea8eb","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nMake the `MSCK` keyword optional in `MSCK REPAIR TABLE` commands so that it can be omitted.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe use of the keyword `MSCK`, meaning metastore check, is arcane and does not add value for the command. Removing it makes the meaning of `REPAIR TABLE` commands more clear.\r\n\r\nThe [Spark documentation page](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-ref-syntax-ddl-repair-table.html) for this command is titled \"REPAIR TABLE\". It only mentions the MSCK keyword in the content of the page, indicating that this keyword is not necessary for the semantic understanding of the command.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, here is a reference from [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/repair-table.html), which completely omits the MSCK keyword.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, previously, it was no possible to specify only `REPAIR TABLE` without `MSCK`. Now, it is possible. No changes to existing behaviour using the original `MSCK REPAIR TABLE` syntax are in this PR.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdds support for subquery decorrelation with UNION, INTERSECT, and EXCEPT on the correlation paths. For example:\r\n```\r\nSELECT t1a, (\r\n  SELECT sum(b) FROM (\r\n    SELECT t2b as b FROM t2 WHERE t2a = t1.t1a\r\n    INTERSECT\r\n    SELECT t3b as b FROM t3 WHERE t3a = t1.t1a\r\n))\r\nFROM t1\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo improve subquery support in Spark.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nBefore this change, queries like this would return an error like: `Decorrelate inner query through Union is not supported.`\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, this query can run successfully.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests and (WIP) SQL

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWe move the decision about supporting columnar output based on WSCG one level from ParquetFileFormat / OrcFileFormat up to FileSourceScanExec, and pass it as a new required option for ParquetFileFormat / OrcFileFormat. Now the semantics is as follows:\r\n* `ParquetFileFormat.supportsBatch` and `OrcFileFormat.supportsBatch` returns whether it **can**, not necessarily **will** return columnar output.\r\n* To return columnar output, an option `FileFormat.OPTION_RETURNING_BATCH` needs to be passed to `buildReaderWithPartitionValues` in these two file formats. It should only be set to `true` if `supportsBatch` is also `true`, but it can be set to `false` if we don't want columnar output nevertheless - this way, `FileSourceScanExec` can set it to false when there are more than 100 columsn for WSCG, and `ParquetFileFormat` / `OrcFileFormat` doesn't have to concern itself about WSCG limits.\r\n* To avoid not passing it by accident, this option is made required. Making it required requires updating a few places that use it, but an error resulting from this is very obscure. It's better to fail early and explicitly here.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis explains it for `ParquetFileFormat`. `OrcFileFormat` had exactly the same issue.\r\n\r\n`java.lang.ClassCastException: org.apache.spark.sql.vectorized.ColumnarBatch cannot be cast to org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.InternalRow` was being thrown because ParquetReader was outputting columnar batches, while FileSourceScanExec expected row output.\r\n\r\nThe mismatch comes from the fact that `ParquetFileFormat.supportBatch` depends on `WholeStageCodegenExec.isTooManyFields(conf, schema)`, where the threshold is 100 fields.\r\n\r\nWhen this is used in `FileSourceScanExec`:\r\n```\r\n  override lazy val supportsColumnar: Boolean = {\r\n      relation.fileFormat.supportBatch(relation.sparkSession, schema)\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nthe `schema` comes from output attributes, which includes extra metadata attributes.\r\n\r\nHowever, inside `ParquetFileFormat.buildReaderWithPartitionValues` it was calculated again as\r\n```\r\n      relation.fileFormat.buildReaderWithPartitionValues(\r\n        sparkSession = relation.sparkSession,\r\n        dataSchema = relation.dataSchema,\r\n        partitionSchema = relation.partitionSchema,\r\n        requiredSchema = requiredSchema,\r\n        filters = pushedDownFilters,\r\n        options = options,\r\n        hadoopConf = hadoopConf\r\n...\r\nval resultSchema = StructType(requiredSchema.fields ++ partitionSchema.fields)\r\n...\r\nval returningBatch = supportBatch(sparkSession, resultSchema)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere `requiredSchema` and `partitionSchema` wouldn't include the metadata columns:\r\n```\r\nFileSourceScanExec: output: List(c1#4608L, c2#4609L, ..., c100#4707L, file_path#6388)\r\nFileSourceScanExec: dataSchema: StructType(StructField(c1,LongType,true),StructField(c2,LongType,true),...,StructField(c100,LongType,true))\r\nFileSourceScanExec: partitionSchema: StructType()\r\nFileSourceScanExec: requiredSchema: StructType(StructField(c1,LongType,true),StructField(c2,LongType,true),...,StructField(c100,LongType,true))\r\n```\r\n\r\nColumn like `file_path#6388` are added by the scan, and contain metadata added by the scan, not by the file reader which concerns itself with what is within the file.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNot a public API change, but it is now required to pass `FileFormat.OPTION_RETURNING_BATCH` in `options` to `ParquetFileFormat.buildReaderWithPartitionValues`. The only user of this API in Apache Spark is `FileSourceScanExec`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTests added\r\n\r\nBackports #38397 from juliuszsompolski/SPARK-40918.\r\n\r\nAuthored-by: Juliusz Sompolski <julek@databricks.com>\r\nSigned-off-by: Wenchen Fan

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7.

Can a cache of recent entries to speed up reads.\r\n\r\nThere is already an existing implementation of a caching mechanism in OffsetSeqLog.  Lets replace it with an implementation in HDFSMetadataLog (parent class) so that we can support reading from in memory cache for both offset log and commit log.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nImprove read speeds for entries in offset log and commit log\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR avoid exceptions in the implementation of KryoDeserializationStream.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nUsing an exceptions for end of stream is slow, especially for small streams. It also problematic as it the exception caught in the KryoDeserializationStream could also be caused by corrupt data which would just be ignored in the current implementation.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, it changes so some method on KryoDeserializationStream no longer raises EOFException.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests.\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR only changes KryoDeserializationStream as a proof of concept. If this is the direction we want to go we should probably change DerserializationStream isntead so that the interface is

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn FetchBlockRequest we currently store a `Seq[FetchBlockInfo]` as part of the function `isRemoteAddressMaxedOut` (probably other places as well, but this is the function that showd up in my profileling) we use the length of this Seq. In scala 2.12 `Seq` is an alias for `scala.collection.Seq` but in 2.13 it an alias for `scala.collection.immutable.Seq`. This means that in when for example we call `toSeq` on a `ArrayBuffer` in 2.12 we do nothing and the `blocks` in the `FetchRequest` will be backed by something with a cheap `length` but in 2.13 we end up copying the data to a `List` with O(n) length function.\r\n\r\nThis PR solves this changing the `Seq` to and `IndexedSeq` and therefore making the expectation of a cheap length function explicit. This means that we some places will do an extra copy in scala 2.13 compared to 2.12 (was also the case before this PR). If we wanted to avoid this copy we should instead change it to use `scala.collection.IndexedSeq` so we would have the same types in both 2.13 and 2.12.  \r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe performance for ShuffleBlockFetcherIterator is much worse on Scala 2.13 than 2.12. Have seen cases were the overhead of repeatedly calculating the length is as much as 20% of cpu time (and could probably be even worse for larger shuffles).\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo. I think the interface changes are only on private classes.\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting specs. \r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to:

It optionally accepts a second integer argument to indicate the number of decimal places for rounding, in either direction. When the second argument is absent, the function rounds to the nearest whole number. When the second argument is specified, the function rounds to the nearest number with n decimal places of precision. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo support truncate numbers\r\neg: \r\ntrunc(123.4382) -> 123\r\ntrunc(-123.4382) -> -123\r\ntrunc(123.4382, 2) -> 123.43\r\ntrunc(123.4382, 1) -> 123.4\r\ntrunc(123.4382, 0) -> 123\r\ntrunc(123.4382, -1) -> 120\r\ntrunc(123.4382, -2) -> 100\r\ntrunc(123.4382, -3) -> 0\r\n\r\nThe same feature is available in Hive, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, Redshift, \r\n**Some references** :\r\nPostgreSQL: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/functions-math.html\r\nAWS Redshift: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_TRUNC.html\r\nPresto : https://prestodb.io/docs/current/functions/math.html?highlight=trunc#id3\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, new built-in function `trunc` is added. Same function has an overloaded version to truncate Date values. \r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nRelax ordering constraint for CREATE TABLE column options.\r\n\r\nBefore this PR, the grammar for each CREATE TABLE column was:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncreateOrReplaceTableColType\r\n    : colName=errorCapturingIdentifier dataType (NOT NULL)? defaultExpression? commentSpec?\r\n    ;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere was a constraint on the order of: `(NOT NULL, DEFAULT value, COMMENT value)`. This PR updates the grammar to allow these options in any order instead, to improve usability.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis helps make the SQL syntax more usable.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, the SQL syntax updates slightly.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting parser tests plus a new unit test.","created_at":"2022-10-27T23:02:09Z","updated_at":"2022-11-01T21:01:29Z","closed_at":"2022-10-31T23:57:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b8b8f8486161f06906a7dc605d4cc406b9677a89","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38418/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38418/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/38418/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5ae0a422844dcb32d507c26321a7cd2eee680431","head":{"label":"dtenedor:create-table-float-options","ref":"create-table-float-options","sha":"5ae0a422844dcb32d507c26321a7cd2eee680431","user":{"login":"dtenedor","id":99207096,"node_id":"U_kgDOBenHuA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99207096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor","html_url":"https://github.com/dtenedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"9fc3aa0b1c092ab1f13b26582e3ece7440fbfc3b","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIn the past, Connect server can check `alias` for `Read` and `Project`. However for Spark DataFrame, every DataFrame can be chained with `as(alias: String)` thus every Relation/LogicalPlan can have an `alias`. This PR refactors to make this work.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe messages returned by allGather may be overridden by the following barrier APIs, eg,\r\n\r\n``` scala\r\n      val messages: Array[String] = context.allGather(\"ABC\")\r\n      context.barrier()\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe  `messages` may be like Array(\"\", \"\"), but we're expecting Array(\"ABC\", \"ABC\") \r\n\r\nThe root cause of this issue is the [messages got by allGather](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/BarrierTaskContext.scala#L102) pointing to the [original message](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/BarrierCoordinator.scala#L107) in the local mode. So when the following barrier APIs changed the messages, then the allGather message will be changed accordingly.\r\nFinally, users can't get the correct result.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixed this issue by sending back the cloned messages.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe bug mentioned in this description may block some external SPARK ML libraries which heavily depend on the spark barrier API to do some synchronization. If the barrier mechanism can't guarantee the correctness of the barrier APIs, it will be a disaster for external SPARK ML libraries.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR migrates all existing proto tests to be DataFrame API based.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n1. The goal for proto tests is to test the capability of representing DataFrames by the Connect proto. So comparing with DataFrame API is more accurate.\r\n2. There are some Connect plan execution requiring SparkSession anyway. We can unify all tests into one suite by only using DataFrame API (e.g. We can merge `SparkConnectDeduplicateSuite.scala` into `SparkConnectProtoSuite.scala`.\r\n3. This also enables the possibility that we can also test result (not only plan) in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nExisting

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the input late record filtering done by stateful operators to allow for chaining of stateful operators. Currently stateful operators are initialized with the current microbatch watermark and perform both input late record filtering and state eviction (e.g. producing aggregations) using the same watermark value. The state evicted (or aggregates produced) due to watermark advancing is behind the watermark and thus effectively late - if a following stateful operator consumes the output of the previous one, the input records will be filtered as late.\r\n\r\nThis PR provides two watermark values to the stateful operators - one from the previous microbatch to be used for late record filtering and the one from the current microbatch (as in the existing code) to be used for state eviction. This solves the above problem of the broken late record filtering.\r\n\r\nNote that this PR still does not solve the issue of time-interval stream join producing records delayed against the watermark. Therefore time-interval streaming join followed by stateful operators is still not supported. That will be fixed in a follow up PR (and a SPIP) effectively replacing the single global watermark with conceptually watermarks per operator.\r\n\r\nAlso, the stateful operator chains unblocked by this PR (e.g. a chain of window aggregations) are still blocked by the unsupported operations checker. The new test for these scenarios - MultiStatefulOperatorsSuite has to explicitly disable the unsupported ops check. This again will be fixed in a follow-up PR.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe PR allows Spark Structured Streaming to support chaining of stateful operators e.g. chaining of time window aggregations which is a meaningful streaming scenario.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWith this PR, chains of stateful operators will be supported in Spark Structured Streaming.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded a new test suite -

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis change adds a third type of WHEN clause to the MERGE INTO command that allows updating or deleting rows from the target table that have no match in the source table based on the merge condition.\r\n\r\nThe following example updates all rows from the target table that have a match in the source table using the source value. For target rows that have no match in the source table, the 'state' column of rows that were created before '2022-10-26' is set to 'active', while rows created before that date are deleted from the target table.\r\n```\r\nMERGE INTO target\r\nUSING source\r\nON target.key = source.key\r\nWHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET *\r\nWHEN NOT MATCHED BY SOURCE AND target.create_at > '2022-10-26' THEN UPDATE SET target.status = 'active'\r\nWHEN NOT MATCHED BY SOURCE THEN DELETE \r\n```\r\n\r\nIn addition, the existing WHEN NOT MATCHED clause can now also include an optional BY TARGET qualifier that has no effect on its semantic other than allowing a more consistent use of the clauses together:\r\n```\r\nWHEN NOT MATCHED BY TARGET THEN INSERT * \r\n```\r\nis equivalent to:\r\n```\r\nWHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT *\r\n```\r\nThe updated SQL syntax for the MERGE INTO command is described more precisely in the user-facing change section below.\r\n\r\nThe changes proposed in this pull request are two-fold:\r\n1. Update SQL parsing to handle the new clause introduced. This results in a new field `notMatchedBySourceActions` being populated in the logical plan node of the MERGE INTO command `MergeIntoTable`.\r\n2. Handle the newly added merge clause during analysis. In particular, resolve all attribute references used in WHEN NOT MATCHED BY SOURCE conditions and actions. The attributes used in a NOT MATCHED BY SOURCE clause may only refer to the target table.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe new clause opens up uses cases leveraging the merge command to sync a target from a source table by conditionally deleting or updating records that are not present in the source. As an example, the following command incrementally syncs the target table from the source table for the past 5 days:\r\n```\r\nMERGE INTO target\r\nUSING (SELECT `columns`  FROM source  WHERE created_at >= (current_date - INTERVAL ‘5’ DAY)  AS tmp_name\r\nON FALSE\r\nWHEN NOT MATCHED BY SOURCE AND (current_date - INTERVAL ‘5’ DAY) THEN DELETE\r\nWHEN NOT MATCHED BY TARGET THEN INSERT `columns`\r\n```\r\nAfter running this command, all rows older than 5 days in the target table are left unmodified while rows newer than 5 days that are either not already in the target table or not in the source table anymore are inserted and deleted, respectively.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nTwo user-facing changes are introduced in the MERGE INTO syntax:\r\n- WHEN NOT MATCHED BY SOURCE clause.\r\n- Optional BY TARGET qualifier for WHEN NOT MATCHED clauses.\r\n\r\nThe updated Spark SQL syntax is:\r\n```\r\nMERGE INTO target_table_name [target_alias]\r\n   USING source_table_reference [source_alias]\r\n   ON merge_condition\r\n   { WHEN MATCHED [ AND matched_condition ] THEN matched_action |\r\n     WHEN NOT MATCHED [BY TARGET] [ AND not_matched_condition ] THEN not_matched_action\r\n     WHEN NOT MATCHED BY SOURCE [ AND not_matched_by_source_condition ] THEN not_matched_by_source_action } [...]\r\n\r\nmatched_action\r\n { DELETE |\r\n   UPDATE SET * |\r\n   UPDATE SET { column = [ expr | DEFAULT ] } [, ...] }\r\n\r\nnot_matched_action\r\n { INSERT * |\r\n   INSERT (column1 [, ...] ) VALUES ( expr | DEFAULT ] [, ...] )\r\n\r\nnot_matched_by_source_action\r\n { DELETE |\r\n   UPDATE SET { column = [ expr | DEFAULT ] } [, ...] }\r\n```\r\nThis syntax replicates the semantics used by other vendors, see:\r\n- [Microsoft T-SQL Merge](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/statements/merge-transact-sql)\r\n- [Google BigQuery Merge](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/dml-syntax#merge_statement)\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTests are extended or added to cover the following aspect of the change:\r\n- Parsing (in DDLParserSuite.scala):\r\n  - Existing tests are extended to cover parsing of WHEN NOT MATCHED BY SOURCE clauses in a range of cases. This covers parsing the clause with optional conditions and a variety of UPDATE and DELETE actions.\r\n  - New tests are added to cover NOT MATCHED BY TARGET and invalid action UPDATE SET * for WHEN NOT MATCHED BY SOURCE.\r\n- Analysis (in PlanResolutionSuite.scala):\r\n  - Existing tests are extended to also cover attribute reference resolution for WHEN NOT MATCHED BY SOURCE conditions and actions together with other type of clauses.\r\n  - New tests are added to cover reference resolution specific to WHEN NOT MATCHED BY SOURCE clauses:\r\n    - Unqualified reference to a column present both in the target and source table is not ambiguous in WHEN NOT MATCHED BY SOURCE conditions or actions since it can only refer to the target table.\r\n    - Reference to columns in the source table are invalid in WHEN NOT MATCHED BY

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nas discussed in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-40922: \r\n\r\n> The path argument of `pyspark.pandas.read_csv(path, ...)` currently has type annotation `str` and is documented as\r\n>\r\n>       path : str\r\n>           The path string storing the CSV file to be read.\r\n>The implementation however uses `pyspark.sql.DataFrameReader.csv(path, ...)` which does support multiple paths:\r\n>\r\n>        path : str or list\r\n>            string, or list of strings, for input path(s),\r\n>            or RDD of Strings storing CSV rows.\r\n>\r\n\r\nThis PR updates the type annotation and documentation of `path` argument of `pyspark.pandas.read_csv`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nLoading multiple CSV files at once is a useful feature to have and should be documented \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nit documents and existing feature\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNo need for tests (so far): only type annotations and docblocks were

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWe move the decision about supporting columnar output based on WSCG one level from ParquetFileFormat / OrcFileFormat up to FileSourceScanExec, and pass it as a new required option for ParquetFileFormat / OrcFileFormat. Now the semantics is as follows:\r\n* `ParquetFileFormat.supportsBatch` and `OrcFileFormat.supportsBatch` returns whether it **can**, not necessarily **will** return columnar output.\r\n* To return columnar output, an option `FileFormat.OPTION_RETURNING_BATCH` needs to be passed to `buildReaderWithPartitionValues` in these two file formats. It should only be set to `true` if `supportsBatch` is also `true`, but it can be set to `false` if we don't want columnar output nevertheless - this way, `FileSourceScanExec` can set it to false when there are more than 100 columsn for WSCG, and `ParquetFileFormat` / `OrcFileFormat` doesn't have to concern itself about WSCG limits.\r\n* To avoid not passing it by accident, this option is made required. Making it required requires updating a few places that use it, but an error resulting from this is very obscure. It's better to fail early and explicitly here.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis explains it for `ParquetFileFormat`. `OrcFileFormat` had exactly the same issue.\r\n\r\n`java.lang.ClassCastException: org.apache.spark.sql.vectorized.ColumnarBatch cannot be cast to org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.InternalRow` was being thrown because ParquetReader was outputting columnar batches, while FileSourceScanExec expected row output.\r\n\r\nThe mismatch comes from the fact that `ParquetFileFormat.supportBatch` depends on `WholeStageCodegenExec.isTooManyFields(conf, schema)`, where the threshold is 100 fields.\r\n\r\nWhen this is used in `FileSourceScanExec`:\r\n```\r\n  override lazy val supportsColumnar: Boolean = {\r\n      relation.fileFormat.supportBatch(relation.sparkSession, schema)\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nthe `schema` comes from output attributes, which includes extra metadata attributes.\r\n\r\nHowever, inside `ParquetFileFormat.buildReaderWithPartitionValues` it was calculated again as\r\n```\r\n      relation.fileFormat.buildReaderWithPartitionValues(\r\n        sparkSession = relation.sparkSession,\r\n        dataSchema = relation.dataSchema,\r\n        partitionSchema = relation.partitionSchema,\r\n        requiredSchema = requiredSchema,\r\n        filters = pushedDownFilters,\r\n        options = options,\r\n        hadoopConf = hadoopConf\r\n...\r\nval resultSchema = StructType(requiredSchema.fields ++ partitionSchema.fields)\r\n...\r\nval returningBatch = supportBatch(sparkSession, resultSchema)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere `requiredSchema` and `partitionSchema` wouldn't include the metadata columns:\r\n```\r\nFileSourceScanExec: output: List(c1#4608L, c2#4609L, ..., c100#4707L, file_path#6388)\r\nFileSourceScanExec: dataSchema: StructType(StructField(c1,LongType,true),StructField(c2,LongType,true),...,StructField(c100,LongType,true))\r\nFileSourceScanExec: partitionSchema: StructType()\r\nFileSourceScanExec: requiredSchema: StructType(StructField(c1,LongType,true),StructField(c2,LongType,true),...,StructField(c100,LongType,true))\r\n```\r\n\r\nColumn like `file_path#6388` are added by the scan, and contain metadata added by the scan, not by the file reader which concerns itself with what is within the file.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNot a public API change, but it is now required to pass `FileFormat.OPTION_RETURNING_BATCH` in `options` to `ParquetFileFormat.buildReaderWithPartitionValues`. The only user of this API in Apache Spark is `FileSourceScanExec`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTests added","created_at":"2022-10-26T12:47:20Z","updated_at":"2022-10-28T17:39:59Z","closed_at":"2022-10-28T12:59:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"42218ebb21b9111afce89bbdeb849a8a6706becd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38397/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38397/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/38397/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e6211fcf9dd63ebec4cf4a9b0f88801080571046","head":{"label":"juliuszsompolski:SPARK-40918","ref":"SPARK-40918","sha":"e6211fcf9dd63ebec4cf4a9b0f88801080571046","user":{"login":"juliuszsompolski","id":25019163,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MDE5MTYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25019163?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski","html_url":"https://github.com/juliuszsompolski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":82301030,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MjMwMTAzMA==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"juliuszsompolski/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"juliuszsompolski","id":25019163,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MDE5MTYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25019163?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski","html_url":"https://github.com/juliuszsompolski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/juliuszsompolski/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, if the creation side of runtime filter could be broadcasted, Spark will not inject a bloom filter or `InSunquery` filter into the application side. I think at first we thought broadcast was cheaper than submit a new job for runtime filter. This behavior is contrary to the join has a shuffle below broadcast hash join described in the design document.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8486025/194822331-7a36b018-dfd9-48ce-a867-7c30a6914791.png)\r\n\r\nIn fact, we just need the creation side is small enough and inject bloom filter which could reuse the broadcast exchange and improve performance.\r\n\r\nAs we know, bloom filter ensures creation side is small enough with the code below.\r\n```\r\n    // Skip if the filter creation side is too big\r\n    if (filterCreationSidePlan.stats.sizeInBytes > conf.runtimeFilterCreationSideThreshold) {\r\n      return filterApplicationSidePlan\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n`InSunquery` filter ensures creation side is small enough with the code below.\r\n```\r\n    val aggregate = Aggregate(Seq(alias), Seq(alias), filterCreationSidePlan)\r\n    if (!canBroadcastBySize(aggregate, conf)) {\r\n      // Skip the InSubquery filter if the size of `aggregate` is beyond broadcast join threshold,\r\n      // i.e., the semi-join will be a shuffled join, which is not worthwhile.\r\n      return filterApplicationSidePlan\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, we can support below scenes.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8486025/212868325-154d21ee-cfc1-4e6c-a27a-a4fd3908e029.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Query Performance Benchmarks: TPC-DS Performance Evaluation**\r\nHere are the test cases this PR can trigger the runtime filter.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe protobuf package shades _com.google.protobuf_ classes. That implies that the user jar providing Java classes also needs to be shaded in the same manner. Otherwise, it does not work as the `Descriptor` class used here and the one used by Java classes in the jar has to match. Otherwise the the Java class can't be instantiated. \r\n\r\nThis requirement is inconvenient and unintuitive for the users. But we can't make this work without shading as Spark already includes an old version of _protobuf-java_ library (2.5.0) which would conflict with user's jar. \r\n\r\nThis PR improves error handling to detect various mismatches and provides more descriptive error message. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Tested manually

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis RP modifies the \"computeStats\" method of the \"LogicalRelation\" class: when the external table does not perform pre-analysis to generate statistics, it calculates the space size of the HDFS file corresponding to the table as the return value and uses this value to update the external table Statistics's sizeInBytes value for lazy calculation of external table statistics. This solves the problem that Row-level Runtime Filtering cannot be applied when the external table does not have pre-performed analysis to generate statistics.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nWhen using external tables, Row-level Runtime Filtering cannot be applied without pre-performing analysis on the table to generate statistics. In actual use, external tables usually do not have pre-executed analysis to generate statistics, but it is also hoped that Row-level Runtime Filtering can be used to improve execution efficiency. The reason why Row-level Runtime Filtering cannot be enabled is that the \"InjectRuntimeFilter\" class calls the \"satisfyByteSizeRequirement\" method to determine whether the Bloom filter application side plan's aggregated scan size meets the requirements, and this value is finally calculated by the \"computeStats\" method of the \"LogicalRelation\" class. The current implementation of the 'computeStats' method first determines whether there is statistics in the external table, and if not, returns the value of 'spark.sql.defaultSizeInBytes', which results in that the calculated value returned when no pre-analysis is performed on the table to generate statistics cannot be satisfied Requirements for applying Row-level Runtime Filtering.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAvoid reordering Add for canonicalizing if it is decimal type and the result data type is changed.\r\nExpressions are canonicalized for comparisons and explanations. For non-decimal Add expression, the order can be sorted by hashcode, and the result is supposed to be the same.\r\nHowever, for Add expression of Decimal type, the behavior is different: Given decimal (p1, s1) and another decimal (p2, s2), the result integral part is `max(p1-s1, p2-s2) +1`, the result decimal part is `max(s1, s2)`. Thus the result data type is `(max(p1-s1, p2-s2) +1 + max(s1, s2), max(s1, s2))`.\r\nThus the order matters:\r\n\r\nFor `(decimal(12,5) + decimal(12,6)) + decimal(3, 2)`, the first add `decimal(12,5) + decimal(12,6)` results in `decimal(14, 6)`, and then `decimal(14, 6) + decimal(3, 2)`  results in `decimal(15, 6)`\r\nFor `(decimal(12, 6) + decimal(3,2)) + decimal(12, 5)`, the first add `decimal(12, 6) + decimal(3,2)` results in `decimal(13, 6)`, and then `decimal(13, 6) + decimal(12, 5)` results in `decimal(14, 6)`\r\n\r\nIn the following query:\r\n```sql\r\ncreate table foo(a decimal(12, 5), b decimal(12, 6)) using orc\r\nselect sum(coalesce(a+b+1.75, a)) from foo\r\n```\r\nAt first `coalesce(a+b+ 1.75, a)` is resolved as `coalesce(a+b+ 1.75, cast(a as decimal(15, 6))`. In the canonicalized version, the expression becomes `coalesce(1.75+b+a, cast(a as decimal(15, 6))`. As explained above, `1.75+b+a` is of decimal(14, 6), which is different from  `cast(a as decimal(15, 6)`. Thus the following error will happen:\r\n```\r\njava.lang.IllegalArgumentException: requirement failed: All input types must be the same except nullable, containsNull, valueContainsNull flags. The input types found are\r\n\tDecimalType(14,6)\r\n\tDecimalType(15,6)\r\n\tat scala.Predef$.require(Predef.scala:281)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.ComplexTypeMergingExpression.dataTypeCheck(Expression.scala:1149)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.ComplexTypeMergingExpression.dataTypeCheck$(Expression.scala:1143) \r\n```\r\nThis PR is to fix the bug.\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n##### Quick submission of drivers in tests to mesos scheduler results in dropping drivers\r\n\r\nQueued drivers in `MesosClusterScheduler` are ordered based on `MesosDriverDescription` - and the ordering used checks for priority (if different), followed by comparison of submission time.\r\nFor two driver submissions with same priority, if made in quick succession (such that submission time is same due to millisecond granularity of Date), this results in dropping the second `MesosDriverDescription` from `queuedDrivers` (since `driverOrdering` returns `0` when comparing the descriptions).\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the more immediate issue with tests.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFlakey tests, [see here](https://lists.apache.org/thread/jof098qxp0s6qqmt9qwv52f9665b1pjg) for an example.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\nFixing only tests for now - as mesos support is deprecated, not changing scheduler itself to address this.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nFixes unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nYou can find a detailed description of the issue and an example reproduction on the Jira card: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-40817\r\n\r\nThe idea for this fix is to update the logic which uploads user-specified files (via `spark.jars`, `spark.files`, etc) to `spark.kubernetes.file.upload.path`. After uploading local files, it used to overwrite the initial list of URIs passed by the user and it would thus erase all remote URIs which were specified there.\r\n\r\nSmall example of this behaviour: \r\n1. User set the value of `spark.jars` to `s3a://some-bucket/my-application.jar,/tmp/some-local-jar.jar` when running `spark-submit` in cluster mode\r\n2. `BasicDriverFeatureStep.getAdditionalPodSystemProperties()` gets called at one point while running `spark-submit`\r\n3. This function would set `spark.jars` to a new value of `${SPARK_KUBERNETES_UPLOAD_PATH}/spark-upload-${RANDOM_STRING}/some-local-jar.jar`. Note that `s3a://some-bucket/my-application.jar` has been discarded.\r\n\r\nWith the logic proposed in this PR, the new value of `spark.jars` would be `s3a://some-bucket/my-application.jar,${SPARK_KUBERNETES_UPLOAD_PATH}/spark-upload-${RANDOM_STRING}/some-local-jar.jar`, so in other words we are making sure that remote URIs are no longer discarded.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe encountered this issue in production when trying to launch Spark on Kubernetes jobs in cluster mode with a mix of local and remote dependencies.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, see description of the new behaviour above.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Added a unit test for the new behaviour\r\n- Added an integration test for the new behaviour\r\n- Tried this patch in our Kubernetes environment with `SparkPi`:\r\n```\r\nspark-submit \\\r\n  --master k8s://https://$KUBERNETES_API_SERVER_URL:443 \\\r\n  --deploy-mode cluster \\\r\n  --name=spark-submit-test \\\r\n  --class org.apache.spark.examples.SparkPi \\\r\n  --conf spark.jars=/opt/my-local-jar.jar,s3a://$BUCKET_NAME/my-remote-jar.jar \\\r\n  --conf spark.kubernetes.file.upload.path=s3a://$BUCKET_NAME/my-upload-path/ \\\r\n  [...]\r\n  /opt/spark/examples/jars/spark-examples_2.12-3.1.3.jar\r\n```\r\nBefore applying the patch, `s3a://$BUCKET_NAME/my-remote-jar.jar` was discarded from the final value of `spark.jars`. After applying the patch and launching the job again, I confirmed that `s3a://$BUCKET_NAME/my-remote-jar.jar` was no longer discarded by looking at the Spark config for the running job.\r\n","created_at":"2022-10-24T16:12:51Z","updated_at":"2023-01-21T13:00:16Z","closed_at":"2023-01-20T02:33:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d36b3c12e79017770288829fb28746ba80a24275","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605057,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/KUBERNETES","name":"KUBERNETES","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38376/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38376/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/38376/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0d7b3ea8471d93f19f90dbf4c146077128859e70","head":{"label":"antonipp:spark-40817","ref":"spark-40817","sha":"0d7b3ea8471d93f19f90dbf4c146077128859e70","user":{"login":"antonipp","id":17275833,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3Mjc1ODMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17275833?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/antonipp","html_url":"https://github.com/antonipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antonipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antonipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antonipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antonipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antonipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antonipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antonipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antonipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antonipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":340054485,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDAwNTQ0ODU=","name":"spark","full_name":"antonipp/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"antonipp","id":17275833,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3Mjc1ODMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17275833?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/antonipp","html_url":"https://github.com/antonipp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antonipp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antonipp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antonipp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antonipp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antonipp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antonipp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antonipp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antonipp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antonipp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/antonipp/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to loosen the requirement of window_time rule to allow multiple distinct window_time calls. After this change, users can call the window_time function with different windows in the same logical node (select, where, etc.).\r\n\r\nGiven that we allow multiple calls of window_time in projection, we no longer be able to use the reserved column name \"window_time\". This PR picked up the SQL representation of the WindowTime, to distinguish each distinct function call. \r\n(This is different from time window/session window, but \"arguably\" saying, they are incorrect. Just that we can't fix them now since the change would incur backward incompatibility...)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe rule for window time followed the existing rules of time window / session window which only allows a single function call in a same projection (strictly saying, it considers the call of function as once if the function is called with same parameters).\r\n\r\nFor time window/session window rules , the restriction makes sense since allowing this would produce cartesian product of rows (although Spark can handle it). But given that window_time only produces one value, the restriction no longer makes sense.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes since it changes the resulting column name from window_time function call, but the function is not released yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew test case.","created_at":"2022-10-23T23:51:11Z","updated_at":"2022-10-28T02:25:56Z","closed_at":"2022-10-28T02:25:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1f6a8b3343ca197f2e8829f7e2390050874c63ad","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38361/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38361/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/38361/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8229274afb9cf73addb8d938f9ddea5c5198993b","head":{"label":"HeartSaVioR:SPARK-40892","ref":"SPARK-40892","sha":"8229274afb9cf73addb8d938f9ddea5c5198993b","user":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":27994296,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzk5NDI5Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"HeartSaVioR/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe `FileFormatWriter` materializes an `AdaptiveQueryPlan` before accessing the plan's `outputOrdering`. This is required for Spark 3.0 to 3.3. Spark 3.4 does not need this because `FileFormatWriter` gets the final plan.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n`FileFormatWriter` enforces an ordering if the written plan does not provide that ordering. An `AdaptiveQueryPlan` does not know its final ordering (Spark 3.0 to 3.3), in which case `FileFormatWriter` enforces the ordering (e.g. by column `\"a\"`) even if the plan provides a compatible ordering (e.g. by columns `\"a\", \"b\"`). In case of spilling, that order (e.g. by columns `\"a\", \"b\"`) gets broken (see SPARK-40588).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nThis fixes SPARK-40588, which was introduced in 3.0. This restores behaviour from Spark 2.4.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThe final plan that is written to files cannot be extracted from `FileFormatWriter`. The bug explained in [SPARK-40588](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-40588) can only be asserted on the result files when spilling occurs. This is very hard to control in an unit test scenario.\r\n\r\nTherefore, this was tested manually. The [example to reproduce this issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-40588?focusedCommentId=17621032&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-17621032) given in SPARK-40588 now produces sorted files.\r\n\r\nThe actual plan written into the files changed from\r\n\r\n```\r\nSort [input[0, bigint, false] ASC NULLS FIRST], false, 0\r\n+- AdaptiveSparkPlan isFinalPlan=false\r\n   +- Sort [day#2L ASC NULLS FIRST, id#4L ASC NULLS FIRST], false, 0\r\n      +- Exchange hashpartitioning(day#2L, 2), REPARTITION_BY_NUM, [id=#30]\r\n         +- BroadcastNestedLoopJoin BuildLeft,

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nProvide a flexible way on K8s for Driver and Executor by using env vars to configure external log service links(pattern) and attributes, on both live Spark UI and SHS.\r\n\r\nThe full design doc is https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MfB39LD4B4Rp7MDRxZbMKMbdNSe6V6mBmMQ-gkCnM-0/edit?usp=sharing\r\n\r\n1. Expose general attributes on K8s, for both Driver and Executor, which can be referred in log URLs pattern and will be persisted into event log. My proposed generic attributes are\r\n  - `APP_ID`\r\n  - `KUBENETES_POD_NAME`\r\n  - `KUBENETES_NAMESPACE`\r\n\r\n2. Allow using env vars to add custom log URLs and attributes, for both Driver and Executor.\r\n  - Driver log URL: env vars w/ prefix `SPARK_DRIVER_LOG_URL_`\r\n  - Driver attribute: env vars w/ prefix `SPARK_DRIVER_ATTRIBUTE_`\r\n  - Executor log URL: env vars w/ prefix `SPARK_LOG_URL_`\r\n  - Executor attribute: env vars w/ prefix `SPARK_EXECUTOR_ATTRIBUTE_`\r\n\r\n3. Always do log URLs replacement for Driver before sending SparkListenerApplicationStart into the LiveListenerBus, so that the Driver could have the log URL replacement ability on live UI, as Executor does.\r\n\r\n4. Always do log URLs replacement for Executor,\r\n  - if `spark.ui.custom.executor.log.url` is provided, as-is;\r\n  - otherwise, use the value of log URL as pattern in case that user-provided log URL refers to the attributes.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently, there is no out-of-box log solution for Spark on K8s.\r\n\r\nFor Spark on Yarn case, Spark provides stdout/stderr log links on Spark UI for the Driver and each Executor which redirects to the Yarn log pages, but for the resource manager which does not provide the out-of-box log services, like K8s, Spark has no log links on Spark UI.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, users who deploy Spark on K8s could add custom log links in the Spark UI by configurations.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### Local mode\r\n\r\n```\r\nbuild/sbt clean package\r\n```\r\n```\r\nexport

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe following codes:\r\n```\r\n      Seq((20, 30, \"partition\"), (15, 20, \"partition\"),\r\n        (30, 70, \"partition\"), (18, 40, \"partition\"))\r\n        .toDF(\"id\", \"sort_col\", \"p\")\r\n        .repartition(1)\r\n        .sortWithinPartitions(\"p\", \"sort_col\")\r\n        .write\r\n        .partitionBy(\"p\")\r\n        .parquet(f.getAbsolutePath)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen the 'Sort'+'partitionBy' operator is used, because 'partitionBy' will generate a new `Sort(\"partition_col\")`, the logical plan is as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSort(\"p\")\r\n  Project(\"id\", \"sort_col\", \"p\")\r\n    Sort(\"p\", \"sort_col\")\r\n      Input\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, due to ` org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.optimizer.EliminateSorts' will prune the operators irrelevant to the output, which will cause 'Sort (\"p\", \"sort_col\")' to be pruned, but in fact it should take effect.\r\n\r\nThis causes Sort to fail in various scenarios, as shown in the following SQL:\r\n```\r\nset spark.hadoop.hive.exec.dynamici.partition=true;\r\nset spark.hadoop.hive.exec.dynamic.partition.mode=nonstrict;\r\n\r\n// this sql sort with partition filed (`dt`) and data filed (`name`), but sort with `name` can not work\r\ninsert overwrite table sort_table partition(dt) select id,name,dt from test_table order by name,dt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe scenario covered by this issue is that 'Sort' is the last 'Transform' operator of the job. When there are other 'Transform' operators after the 'Sort', the Sort should not be effective.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nfix bug\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why
