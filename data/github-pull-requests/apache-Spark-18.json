What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe PR proposes to disable PruneFilters if the predicate of the filter is evaluated to `null` / `false` and the filter (and subtree) is streaming.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nPruneFilters replaces the `null` / `false` filter with an empty relation, which means the subtree of the filter is also lost. The optimization does not care about whichever operator is in the subtree, hence some important operators like stateful operator, watermark node, observe node could be lost.\r\n\r\nThe filter could be evaluated to `null` / `false` selectively among microbatches in various reasons (one simple example is the modification of the query during restart), which means stateful operator might not be available for batch N and be available for batch N + 1. For this case, streaming query will fail as batch N + 1 cannot load the state from batch N, and it's not recoverable in most cases.\r\n\r\nSee new tests in StreamingQueryOptimizationCorrectnessSuite for details.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUT.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-09-18T18:20:05Z","updated_at":"2024-09-20T09:05:36Z","closed_at":"2024-09-20T09:05:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6d3c671776c18db5d53c5316f5669357a7f0b104","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd support for state variables with value state collection types and read change feed options\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWithout this, we cannot support reading per key changes for state variables used with stateful processors.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes\r\n\r\nUsers can now query value state variables with the following query:\r\n\r\n```\r\n        val changeFeedDf = spark.read\r\n            .format(\"statestore\")\r\n            .option(StateSourceOptions.PATH, <checkpoint_loc>)\r\n            .option(StateSourceOptions.STATE_VAR_NAME, <state_var_name>)\r\n            .option(StateSourceOptions.READ_CHANGE_FEED, true)\r\n            .option(StateSourceOptions.CHANGE_START_BATCH_ID, 0)\r\n            .load()\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded unit tests\r\n\r\n```\r\n[info] Run completed in 17 seconds, 318

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR removes the self type parameter from Dataset. This turned out to be a bit noisy. The self type is replaced by a combination of covariant return types and abstract types. Abstract types are used when a method takes a Dataset (or a KeyValueGroupedDataset) as an argument.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe self type made using the classes in sql/api a bit noisy.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-09-18T16:18:27Z","updated_at":"2024-09-19T00:10:29Z","closed_at":"2024-09-19T00:10:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"30e631ab0049dd9e08d882dae0d12c28def5b5d6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nSingle join is a left outer join that checks that there is at most 1 build row for every probe row.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds single join implementation to support correlated scalar subqueries where the optimizer can't guarantee that 1 row is coming from them, e.g.:\r\nselect *, (select t1.x from t1 where t1.y >= t_outer.y) from t_outer.\r\n-- this subquery is going to be rewritten as a single join that makes sure there is at most 1 matching build row for every probe row. It will issue a spark runtime error otherwise.\r\n\r\nDesign doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NTsvtBTB9XvvyRvH62QzWIZuw4hXktALUG1fBP7ha1Q/edit\r\n\r\nThe optimizer introduces a single join in cases that were previously returning incorrect results (or were unsupported).\r\nOnly hash-based implementation is supported, the optimizer makes sure we don't plan a single join as a sort-merge join.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nExpands our subquery coverage.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, previously unsupported scalar subqueries should now work.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUnit tests for the single join operator. Query tests for the subqueries.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR fixes the pushdown of ^ operator (XOR operator) for Postgres. Those two databases use this as exponent, rather then bitwise xor.\r\n\r\nFix is consisted of overriding the SQLExpressionBuilder to replace the '^' character with '#'.\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nResult is incorrect.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. The user will now have a proper translation of the ^ operator.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/48004 we added new SQL functions `randstr` and `uniform`. This PR adds DataFrame API support for them.\r\n\r\nFor example, in Scala:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsql(\"create table t(col int not null) using csv\")\r\nsql(\"insert into t values (0)\")\r\nval df = sql(\"select col from t\")\r\ndf.select(randstr(lit(5), lit(0)).alias(\"x\")).select(length(col(\"x\")))\r\n> 5\r\n\r\ndf.select(uniform(lit(10), lit(20), lit(0)).alias(\"x\")).selectExpr(\"x > 5\")\r\n> true\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis improves DataFrame parity with the SQL API.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, see above.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds unit test coverage.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-09-18T09:33:01Z","updated_at":"2024-09-25T02:58:21Z","closed_at":"2024-09-25T02:57:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"333fe2f1f28b28858561355216017791950d57c2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"xinrong-meng","id":47337188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzM3MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47337188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng","html_url":"https://github.com/xinrong-meng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48143/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48143/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48143/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d95a391506d8dc546512300a1144ea0a468a6d5e","head":{"label":"dtenedor:dataframes-uniform-randstr","ref":"dataframes-uniform-randstr","sha":"d95a391506d8dc546512300a1144ea0a468a6d5e","user":{"login":"dtenedor","id":99207096,"node_id":"U_kgDOBenHuA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99207096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor","html_url":"https://github.com/dtenedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":592933002,"node_id":"R_kgDOI1dwig","name":"spark","full_name":"dtenedor/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dtenedor","id":99207096,"node_id":"U_kgDOBenHuA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99207096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor","html_url":"https://github.com/dtenedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dtenedor/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSupport line plot with plotly backend on both Spark Connect and Spark classic.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhile Pandas on Spark supports plotting, PySpark currently lacks this feature. The proposed API will enable users to generate visualizations, such as line plots, by leveraging libraries like Plotly. This will provide users with an intuitive, interactive way to explore and understand large datasets directly from PySpark DataFrames, streamlining the data analysis workflow in distributed environments.\r\n\r\nSee more at [PySpark Plotting API Specification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IjOEzC8zcetG86WDvqkereQPj_NGLNW7Bdu910g30Dg/edit?usp=sharing) in progress.\r\n\r\nPart of

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nRefine the string representation of literal date and datetime\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1, we should not represent those

an unresolved expression in connect, but we can try our best to do so)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nyes\r\n\r\nbefore:\r\n```\r\nIn [3]: lit(datetime.date(2024,

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nEliminate the use of global locks in the session and execution managers. Those locks residing in the streaming query manager cannot be easily removed because the tag and query maps seemingly need to be synchronised.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIn order to achieve true scalability.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nExisting tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for details.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-09-17T08:13:22Z","updated_at":"2024-09-19T06:13:14Z","closed_at":"2024-09-19T00:10:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"70553ee3eb90f20ff44b3f93ade648c6443a0714","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48131/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48131/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48131/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7b1c17822ec91039357f255ab38bc7981749ce27","head":{"label":"changgyoopark-db:SPARK-49684","ref":"SPARK-49684","sha":"7b1c17822ec91039357f255ab38bc7981749ce27","user":{"login":"changgyoopark-db","id":164183463,"node_id":"U_kgDOCck9pw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164183463?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/changgyoopark-db","html_url":"https://github.com/changgyoopark-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changgyoopark-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changgyoopark-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changgyoopark-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changgyoopark-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changgyoopark-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changgyoopark-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changgyoopark-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changgyoopark-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changgyoopark-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":802238067,"node_id":"R_kgDOL9Eucw","name":"spark","full_name":"changgyoopark-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"changgyoopark-db","id":164183463,"node_id":"U_kgDOCck9pw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164183463?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/changgyoopark-db","html_url":"https://github.com/changgyoopark-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changgyoopark-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changgyoopark-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changgyoopark-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changgyoopark-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changgyoopark-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changgyoopark-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changgyoopark-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changgyoopark-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changgyoopark-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/changgyoopark-db/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to limit `Sphinx` build parallelism to 4 by default for the following goals.\r\n- This will preserve the same speed in GitHub Action environment.\r\n- This will prevent the exhaustive `SparkSubmit` invocation in large machines like `c6i.24xlarge`.\r\n- The user still can override by providing `SPHINXOPTS`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`Sphinx` parallelism feature was added via the following on 2024-01-10.\r\n\r\n- #44680\r\n\r\nHowever, unfortunately, this breaks Python API doc generation in large machines because this means the number of parallel `SparkSubmit` invocation of PySpark. In addition, given that each `PySpark` currently is launched with `local[*]`, this ends up `N * N` `pyspark.daemon`s.\r\n\r\nIn other words, as of today, this default setting, `auto`, seems to work on low-core machine like `GitHub Action` runners (4 cores). For example, this breaks `Python` documentations build even on M3 Max environment and this is worse on large EC2 machines (c7i.24xlarge). You can see the failure locally like this.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt package -Phive-thriftserver\r\n$ cd python/docs\r\n$ make html\r\n...\r\n24/09/16 17:04:38 WARN Utils: Service 'SparkUI' could not bind on port 4040.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nvalidateSchemaOutput check case sensitivity flag and pick comparison methods according to the result.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIf we're using `spark.sql.caseSensitive` set to false, we should accept queries like this:\r\n```\r\n          |SELECT * FROM (\r\n          |    Select a.ppmonth,\r\n          |    a.ppweek,\r\n          |    case when a.retsubcategoryderived <= 1 then 'XXXXXXXXXXXXX'\r\n          |    else\r\n          |    'XXXXXX'\r\n          |    end as mappedflag,\r\n          |    b.name as subcategory_name,\r\n          |    sum(a.totalvalue) as RDOLLARS\r\n          |    from a, b\r\n          |    where a.retsubcategoryderived = b.retsubcategoryderived\r\n          |    group by a.Ppmonth,a.ppweek,a.retsubcategoryderived,b.name, mappedflag)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, validateSchemaOutput in optimizer's checks about plan schema changes does not use this flag, which leads to a situation that some queries will fail this check even if the optimization is correct. Take this query as an example:\r\nAfter AggregatePushdownThroughJoins, the schema Ppmonth does not match with schema ppmonth in validateSchemaOutput and it then fails this check.\r\n\r\nWe need to use this flag in validateSchemaOutput.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nyes, the above query is accepted and run successfully.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nWIP\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIncreases the default `maxBatchSize` from 4MiB * 0.7 to 128MiB (=\r\nCONNECT_GRPC_MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE) * 0.7. This makes better use of the allowed maximum message size.\r\nThis limit is used when creating Arrow batches for the `SqlCommandResult` in the `SparkConnectPlanner` and for `ExecutePlanResponse.ArrowBatch` in `processAsArrowBatches`. This, for example, lets us return much larger `LocalRelations` in the `SqlCommandResult` (i.e., for the `SHOW PARTITIONS` command) while still staying within the GRPC message size limit.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThere are `SqlCommandResults` that exceed 0.7 * 4MiB.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNow support `SqlCommandResults` <= 0.7 * 128 MiB instead of only <= 0.7 * 4MiB and ExecutePlanResponses will now better use the limit of 128MiB. \r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-09-16T15:34:48Z","updated_at":"2024-09-18T23:54:24Z","closed_at":"2024-09-18T23:54:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3576e5735749f5e4fd47bff5f61374b955f6579e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48122/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48122/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48122/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b0bfb27176743a35445fadbb3bbc3ea6ca5657c6","head":{"label":"dillitz:increase-sql-command-batch-size","ref":"increase-sql-command-batch-size","sha":"b0bfb27176743a35445fadbb3bbc3ea6ca5657c6","user":{"login":"dillitz","id":135709731,"node_id":"U_kgDOCBbEIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/135709731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz","html_url":"https://github.com/dillitz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":661600404,"node_id":"R_kgDOJ284lA","name":"spark","full_name":"dillitz/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dillitz","id":135709731,"node_id":"U_kgDOCBbEIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/135709731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz","html_url":"https://github.com/dillitz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dillitz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dillitz/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIn this PR, I propose to disallow `CS_AI` collated strings in expressions that use `StringsSearch` in their implementation. These expressions are `trim`, `startswith`, `endswith`, `locate`, `instr`, `str_to_map`, `contains`, `replace`, `split_part` and `substring_index`.\r\n\r\nCurrently, these expressions support all possible collations, however, they do not work properly with `CS_AI` collators. This is because there is no support for `CS_AI` search in the ICU's `StringSearch` class which is used to implement these expressions. Therefore, the expressions are not behaving correctly when used with `CS_AI` collators (e.g. currently `startswith('hOtEl' collate unicode_ai, 'Hotel' collate unicode_ai)` returns `true`).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nProposed changes are necessary in order to achieve correct behavior of the expressions mentioned above.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nThis patch was tested by adding a test in the `CollationSuite`.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR makes the isolation feature introduced by `SparkSession.addArtifact` API (added in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/47631) work with Spark SQL.\r\n\r\nNote that this PR does not enable isolation for the following two use cases:\r\n\r\n- PySpark\r\n\t- Future work is needed to add API to support adding isolated Python UDTFs.\r\n- When Hive is used as the metastore\r\n\t- Hive UDF is a huge blocker due to artifacts can be used outside a `SparkSession`, which resources escaped from our session scope.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nBecause it didn't work before :)\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, the user can add a new artifact in the REPL and use it in the current REPL session.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded a new test.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-09-16T10:06:43Z","updated_at":"2024-12-06T23:04:34Z","closed_at":"2024-11-13T01:51:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0f0527c3540109cd514c892767bd270e43138485","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nRemove `spark-sql-api` dependency from documentation.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nDependency `spark-connect-client-jvm` is sufficient, as it includes (shaded) the `spark-sql-api` package.\r\n\r\nIn fact, adding the `spark-sql-api` dependency breaks runtime:\r\n1. transient dependency `io.netty:netty-buffer`, that is also included in `spark-connect-client-jvm` (shaded) cannot be found: `NoClassDefFoundError: io/netty/buffer/PooledByteBufAllocator`\r\n2. method `ArrowUtils$.toArrowSchema` provided by `spark-sql-api` cannot be found: `NoSuchMethodError: 'org.sparkproject.org.apache.arrow.vector.types.pojo.Schema org.apache.spark.sql.util.ArrowUtils$.toArrowSchema(org.apache.spark.sql.types.StructType, java.lang.String,

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to link `python3` to `python3.9` in `spark-rm` docker image.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWe already link `python` to `python3.9` in `Dockerfile`.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/931ab065df3952487028316ebd49c2895d947bf2/dev/create-release/spark-rm/Dockerfile#L139\r\n\r\nAlso, we link `python3` to `python3.9` in Documentation CI.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/b4f4d9b7a7d470158af39d75824bcc501e3506da/.github/workflows/build_and_test.yml#L871-L874\r\n\r\nWe need to link `python3` to

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn `validateAndMaybeEvolveStateSchema`, existing schema and new schema are sorted by column family name.\r\nThe sorting can be delayed until `createSchemaFile` is called.\r\nWhen computing `colFamiliesAddedOrRemoved`, we can use `toSet` to compare column families.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis would make `validateAndMaybeEvolveStateSchema` faster.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR updates unit tests and docs to update references to long-deprecated Hive JDBC client connection string parameters.\r\n\r\nThe current docs and some test code are using parameters that have been deprecated for nearly a decade since https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-6972 / https://github.com/apache/hive/commit/07082e8a851cb44a95dcae50bc84fb43cb1e84c6 , so I think it's safe to clean up the usages now.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWhile looking at some hive-thriftserver unit tests logs, I saw repeated spam of\r\n```\r\n20/06/05 06:35:55.442 pool-1-thread-1 WARN Utils: ***** JDBC param deprecation *****\r\n20/06/05 06:35:55.442 pool-1-thread-1 WARN Utils: The use of hive.server2.transport.mode is deprecated.\r\n20/06/05 06:35:55.442 pool-1-thread-1 WARN Utils: Please use transportMode like so: jdbc:hive2://<host>:<port>/dbName;transportMode=<transport_mode_value>\r\n20/06/05 06:35:55.442 pool-1-thread-1 WARN Utils: ***** JDBC param deprecation *****\r\n20/06/05 06:35:55.442 pool-1-thread-1 WARN Utils: The use of hive.server2.thrift.http.path is deprecated.\r\n20/06/05 06:35:55.442 pool-1-thread-1 WARN Utils: Please use httpPath like so: jdbc:hive2://<host>:<port>/dbName;httpPath=<http_path_value> \r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, it's just a test + documentation change, recommending syntax which has been long-supported (some tests were [already using the new parameters](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/d3eb99f79e508d62fdb7e9bc595f0240ac021df5/sql/hive-thriftserver/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/hive/thriftserver/SharedThriftServer.scala#L81-L85)).\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests (let's wait to confirm that they pass in CI).\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR modifies the `SharedSparkContext` text suite mixin trait so that it instantiates SparkConf as `new SparkConf()` instead of `new SparkConf(loadDefaults = false)`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSpark's SBT and Maven builds configure certain test default configurations using system properties, including disabling the Spark UI and lowering Derby metastore durability: https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/08a26bb56cfb48f27c68a79be1e15bc4c9e466e0/project/SparkBuild.scala#L1616-L1633\r\n\r\nMost test suites pick up defaults set at this layer.\r\n\r\nHowever, the `SharedSparkContext` trait was using `new SparkConf(false)` which bypasses the loading of these defaults.\r\n\r\nAs a result, tests which used this trait don't pick up default configurations and instead try to launch the Spark UI, which may lead to test flakiness due to port binding conflicts.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to change this to `new SparkConf()` to address this issue. This change brings `SharedSparkContext` to parity with `SharedSparkSession`, which was already running with `loadDefaults = true`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nThis is a test-only change, so it's not expected to impact users of Apache Spark itself.\r\n\r\nHowever, it might possibly impact third-party developers who directly depend on Apache Spark's own test JARs.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nRunning existing tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn general, spark cannot handle this query because:\r\n1. Decorrelation logic tries to rewrite limit operator into Window aggregation and pull up correlated predicates, and Union operator is rewritten to have DomainJoin within its children with outer references.\r\n2. When we're rewriting DomainJoin to real join execution, it needs attribute reference map based on pulled up correlated predicates to rewrite outer references in DomainJoin. However, each child of Union/SetOp operator are using different attribute references even they are referring to the same column of outer table. We need Union/SetOp output and its children output to map between these references.\r\n3. Combined with aggregation and filters with inequality comparison, more outer references are remained within children of Union operator, and these references are not covered in Union/SetOp output which leads to lacking of information when we're trying to map different attributed references within children of Union/SetOp operator.\r\n \r\nMore context -> please read this short investigation doc(I've changed the link and it's now public): \r\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1_pJIi_8GuLHOXabLEgRy2e7OHw-OIBnWbwGwSkwIcxg/edit?usp=sharing\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nApply reservoir sampling in `SampledPlotBase`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nExisting sampling approach has two drawbacks:\r\n\r\n1, it needs two jobs to sample `max_rows` rows:\r\n\r\n- df.count() to compute `fraction = max_rows / count`\r\n- df.sample(fraction).to_pandas() to do the sampling\r\n\r\n2, the df.sample is based on Bernoulli sampling which **cannot** guarantee the sampled size == expected `max_rows`, e.g.\r\n```\r\nIn [1]: df = spark.range(10000)\r\n\r\nIn [2]: [df.sample(0.01).count() for i in range(0, 10)]\r\nOut[2]: [96, 97, 95, 97, 105, 105, 105, 87, 95, 110]\r\n```\r\nThe size of sampled data is floating near the target size 10000*0.01=100.\r\nThis relative deviation cannot be ignored, when the input dataset is large and the sampling fraction is small.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nCI and manually check\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo","created_at":"2024-09-13T10:50:29Z","updated_at":"2024-09-18T00:44:58Z","closed_at":"2024-09-18T00:44:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"333a01511938c9daaba8067fc499ae7f0447dd4d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4138679613,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs72rz09","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PANDAS%20API%20ON%20SPARK","name":"PANDAS

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIt's possible that a logical plan instance is being shared by multiple DFs and these DFs are executed in parallel. Spark always copy stateful expressions before evaluating them, but one place is missed: `ConstantFolding` can also execute expressions. This PR fixes it.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSupport horizontal and vertical bar plots with plotly backend on both Spark Connect and Spark classic.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhile Pandas on Spark supports plotting, PySpark currently lacks this feature. The proposed API will enable users to generate visualizations. This will provide users with an intuitive, interactive way to explore and understand large datasets directly from PySpark DataFrames, streamlining the data analysis workflow in distributed environments.\r\n\r\nSee more at [PySpark Plotting API Specification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IjOEzC8zcetG86WDvqkereQPj_NGLNW7Bdu910g30Dg/edit?usp=sharing) in progress.\r\n\r\nPart of

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nA Trait UnionEquality is introduced which is implemented by Union and UnionExec nodes.  It contains code to check equality of Union node legs in an  order agnostic manner  and also hashCode independent of the order of the legs. The equality does consider if the output attributes of the head nodes are same in terms of name, datatype, metadata, nullability etc (but not exprIDs).\r\nIt is true that converting  Sequence of Legs into set to get order agnostic hashCode can result in situation like:\r\nSeq(leg1, leg2) and Seq(leg1, leg2, leg2) to have same hashCode when converted to Set, but that should not cause logical problem as equality checks for length.\r\nThough if we want to avoid hash collision in that situation, the code can be changed to\r\nObjects.hashCode(Seq(leg1, leg2).map(_.hashCode).sorted: _*)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nBecause of the way the equality of Union nodes behave currently, changing the order of the legs, will cause cache miss and reuse of exchange not happening, as the canonicalized plans will not match.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded tests to check the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds SQL pipe syntax support for the PIVOT and UNPIVOT operators.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCREATE TEMPORARY VIEW courseSales AS SELECT * FROM VALUES\r\n  (\"dotNET\", 2012, 10000),\r\n  (\"Java\", 2012, 20000),\r\n  (\"dotNET\", 2012, 5000),\r\n  (\"dotNET\", 2013, 48000),\r\n  (\"Java\", 2013, 30000)\r\n  as courseSales(course, year, earnings);\r\n\r\nTABLE courseSales\r\n|> SELECT `year`, course, earnings\r\n|> PIVOT (\r\n     SUM(earnings)\r\n     FOR course IN ('dotNET', 'Java')\r\n  );\r\n\r\n2012\t15000\t20000\r\n2013\t48000\t30000\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe SQL pipe operator syntax will let users compose queries in a more flexible fashion.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, see above.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a few unit test cases, but mostly relies on golden file test coverage. I did this to make sure the answers are correct as this feature is implemented and also so we can look at the analyzer output plans to ensure they look right as well.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds SQL pipe syntax support for the WHERE operator.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCREATE TABLE t(x INT, y STRING) USING CSV;\r\nINSERT INTO t VALUES (0, 'abc'), (1, 'def');\r\n\r\nCREATE TABLE other(a INT, b INT) USING JSON;\r\nINSERT INTO other VALUES (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 4);\r\n\r\nTABLE t\r\n|> WHERE x + LENGTH(y) < 4;\r\n\r\n0\tabc\r\n\r\nTABLE t\r\n|> WHERE (SELECT ANY_VALUE(a) FROM other WHERE x = a LIMIT 1) = 1\r\n\r\n1       def\r\n\r\nTABLE t\r\n|> WHERE SUM(x) = 1\r\n\r\nError: aggregate functions are not allowed in the pipe operator |> WHERE clause\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe SQL pipe operator syntax will let users compose queries in a more flexible fashion.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, see above.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a few unit test cases, but mostly relies on golden file test coverage. I did this to make sure the answers are correct as this feature is implemented and also so we can look at the analyzer output plans to ensure they look right as well.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUse the plan ID as the key type of the session-local plan cache.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe protobuf message size can be as large as 128MB; using this type of data as the key of a cache has two problems.\r\n1. Performance: comparing keys can be inefficient if large messages are cached.\r\n2. Memory: keys can consume a substantially large amount of memory.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdd a test.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to \r\n- introduce `TVF` `collations()`.\r\n- remove the `SHOW COLLATIONS` command.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nBased on @cloud-fan's suggestion: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/47364#issuecomment-2345183501\r\nI believe that after this, we can do many things based on it, such as `filtering` and `querying` based on `LANGUAGE` or `COUNTRY`, etc. eg:\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT * FROM collations() WHERE LANGUAGE like '%Chinese%';\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, provide a new TVF `collations()` for end-users.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Add new UT.\r\n- Pass GA.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nRemoved error condition **_LEGACY_ERROR_TEMP_2011**, removed **dataTypeUnexpectedError**, **typeUnsupportedError**, and replaced them with

I changed dataTypeUnexpectedError to internalError, since _typeSoFar_ argument will always be either:\r\n- NullType if this is the first row or\r\n- Some type which is returned by the

I changed typeUnsupportedError to internalError, since:\r\n- in [this](https://github.com/apache/spark/compare/master...ivanjevtic-db:spark:remove-legacy-error-temp-2011?expand=1#diff-e9a88a888c1543c718c24f25036307cb32348ca3f618a8fa19240bdc3c0ffaf4L204) function

changed dataTypeUnexpectedError to internalError, since there is a type signature [here](https://github.com/apache/spark/compare/master...ivanjevtic-db:spark:remove-legacy-error-temp-2011?expand=1#diff-d1fa4a2cbd66cff7d7d8a90d7ac70457a31e906cebb7d43a46a6036507fb4e7bL104) which prevents _child.dataType_ from being unexpected type.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBuild passing.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to add API compatibility check between Classic and Connect.\r\n\r\nThis PR also includes updating both APIs to the same signature.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nAPIs supported on both Spark Connect and Spark Classic should guarantee the same signature, such as argument and return types.\r\n\r\nFor example, test would fail when the signature of API is mismatched:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSignature mismatch in Column method 'dropFields'\r\nClassic: (self, *fieldNames: str) -> pyspark.sql.column.Column\r\nConnect: (self, *fieldNames: 'ColumnOrName') -> pyspark.sql.column.Column\r\n<Signature (self, *fieldNames: 'ColumnOrName') -> pyspark.sql.column.Column> != <Signature

pyspark.sql.column.Column>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, it is a test to prevent future API behavior inconsistencies between Classic and Connect.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded UTs.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

IntegerType\r\n\r\n@udtf(returnType=\"item: int\")\r\nclass RepeatItem:\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    A UDTF that returns `item` as many rows as specified in `num_rows`.\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    def eval(self, item: int, num_rows: int):\r\n        for i in range(0, num_rows):\r\n            yield (item,)\r\n```\r\n\r\nUDTF allows direct input without `lit()`:\r\n\r\n**Before**\r\n\r\n```python\r\nRepeatItem(lit(2024), lit(6)).show()\r\n```\r\n\r\n**After** (NOTE: Before also still works)\r\n```python\r\nRepeatItem(2024, 6).show()\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded UTs for the existing test suites\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo","created_at":"2024-09-11T11:07:53Z","updated_at":"2024-09-23T02:08:37Z","closed_at":"2024-09-23T02:08:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a2db79230e273e1641af025a0ba346db8609e5f0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1496047285,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDk2MDQ3Mjg1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/EXAMPLES","name":"EXAMPLES","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48074/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48074/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48074/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/67ccd336ec5c738c487b05b5a83644b7a0ec09f2","head":{"label":"itholic:SPARK-49597","ref":"SPARK-49597","sha":"67ccd336ec5c738c487b05b5a83644b7a0ec09f2","user":{"login":"itholic","id":44108233,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTA4MjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44108233?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic","html_url":"https://github.com/itholic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":445423122,"node_id":"R_kgDOGoyeEg","name":"spark","full_name":"itholic/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"itholic","id":44108233,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTA4MjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44108233?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic","html_url":"https://github.com/itholic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/itholic/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nUp until this [PR](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/47880) that enabled deleteIfExists, we changed the condition on which we throw an error. However, in doing so, we are not writing schema files whenever we add or remove column families, which is functionally incorrect. \r\nAdditionally, we were initially always writing the newSchemaFilePath to the OperatorStateMetadata upon every new query run, when we should only do this if the schema changes. \r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThese changes are needed because we want to write a schema file out every time we add or remove column families. Also, we want to make sure that we point to the old schema file for the current metadata file if the schema has not changed between this run and the last one, as opposed to populating the metadata with a new schema file path every time, even if this file is not created.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nAmended unit tests\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for details.\r\n-->\r\nNo","created_at":"2024-09-10T22:55:45Z","updated_at":"2024-09-12T03:01:13Z","closed_at":"2024-09-12T03:01:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ae5f43537aac41d1a636355ee6b64f41bbf5bddd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFixes a bug in the `OperatorStateMetadataV2Reader` where the `read` method, if called in isolation, could return the wrong metadata.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe `OperatorStateMetadataV2Reader` has _end-behavior_ that is desirable, but it only \"accidentally\" works. Currently, if you have the offsets `0 1 2` and ask for `batchId = 3`, the `read` method could return you the operator state metadata for `2` instead of throwing an error. In practice, this doesn't happen, since we have a check in the constructor that the `batchId` provided must be less than or equal to the last offset.\r\n\r\nReally, what we want is that if `read` ever gets called and the asked-for `batchId` doesn't exist, an error should be thrown there instead of silently returning wrong metadata.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAll existing UTs should pass.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-09-10T22:32:54Z","updated_at":"2024-09-12T07:00:38Z","closed_at":"2024-09-12T07:00:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8e95d69b8bc24143eb0c30ce4c1127e2c84b443b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR does two things:\r\n- It adds shims for SparkContext and RDD. These are in a separate module. This module is a compile time dependency for sql/api, and a regular dependency for connector/connect/client/jvm. We remove this dependency in catalyst and connect-server because those should use the actual implementation.\r\n- It adds RDD (and the one SparkContext) based method to the shared Scala API. For connect these methods throw an unsupported operation exception.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe are creating a shared Scala interface for Classic and Connect.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests. I will add a couple on the connect side.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-09-10T20:35:36Z","updated_at":"2024-10-09T15:18:57Z","closed_at":"2024-10-09T01:24:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c8f5cbde364a6f77eb3d67de59ba768b21092ae2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48065/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48065/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48065/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/82b65627037d65891a4a2e9b7e01fae4a632c3ef","head":{"label":"hvanhovell:SPARK-49569","ref":"SPARK-49569","sha":"82b65627037d65891a4a2e9b7e01fae4a632c3ef","user":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35900688,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTkwMDY4OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"hvanhovell/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd a concept of logical type to the variant README.md, distinct from the physical encoding of a value. In particular, decimal and integer values are considered to be members of a single \"Exact Numeric\" type.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis is intended to describe and justify the existing Spark behaviour for Variant (e.g. stripping trailing zeros for decimal to string casts), not change it. (Although the SchemaOfVariant expression does not strictly follow this right now for numeric types, and should be updated to match it.) The motivation for introducing a single numeric type that encompasses integer and decimal values is to allow more flexibility in storage (particularly once shredding is introduced), and provide a simpler user surface, since there is not much benefit to distinguishing numeric precision/scale on a per-value basis.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nIt is a documentation change.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-09-10T20:29:02Z","updated_at":"2024-09-12T14:36:05Z","closed_at":"2024-09-12T14:36:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1768b4666c8fbfb95acad452cf3f4af23b937dbd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48064/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48064/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48064/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/bf015b919f2818a7aa6669fcffefd03c59643596","head":{"label":"cashmand:cashmand/SPARK-49591","ref":"cashmand/SPARK-49591","sha":"bf015b919f2818a7aa6669fcffefd03c59643596","user":{"login":"cashmand","id":54722026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NzIyMDI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54722026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand","html_url":"https://github.com/cashmand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":469837514,"node_id":"R_kgDOHAEmyg","name":"spark","full_name":"cashmand/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cashmand","id":54722026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NzIyMDI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54722026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand","html_url":"https://github.com/cashmand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cashmand/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cashmand/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose new sub-condition `SECONDS_FRACTION` of the error condition `INVALID_DATETIME_PATTERN` in case when datetime pattern doesn't contain proper seconds fraction of variable length.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo fix the failure on internal assert. This change should improve user experience with Spark SQL.\r\n\r\nBefore the changes, Spark fails while parsing the datetime patterns like `\\nSSSS\\r`:\r\n```\r\njava.lang.AssertionError: assertion failed\r\n\tat scala.Predef$.assert(Predef.scala:264)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.ErrorClassesJsonReader.getMessageTemplate(ErrorClassesJSONReader.scala:91)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.ErrorClassesJsonReader.getErrorMessage(ErrorClassesJSONReader.scala:46)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nShould not. Only if user's code depends on the format of error message.\r\n\r\nAfter changes, users get the error:\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.SparkIllegalArgumentException: [INVALID_DATETIME_PATTERN.SECONDS_FRACTION] Unrecognized datetime pattern:\r\n. Cannot detect a seconds fraction pattern of variable length. Please make sure the pattern contains 'S', and does not contain illegal characters. SQLSTATE: 22007\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running new test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.util.DateTimeFormatterHelperSuite\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-09-10T09:36:26Z","updated_at":"2024-09-10T13:47:58Z","closed_at":"2024-09-10T13:47:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e8b43e33c4918a392af1b8bc08cfd43f85aec83d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48058/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48058/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48058/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a1b3be50884c94e883e98417857ed6fc818f7269","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:fix-INVALID_DATETIME_PATTERN","ref":"fix-INVALID_DATETIME_PATTERN","sha":"a1b3be50884c94e883e98417857ed6fc818f7269","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nRemoval of suggestion to turn off ansi when experiencing CAST_INVALID_INPUT or CAST_OVERFLOW.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThese errors already contain sufficient suggestions, amongst which one is to use `try_cast` in place of `cast`. This removal of ANSI turn off suggestion is part of a movement to keep suggestions of not using ANSI in code to minimum.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. This PR is changing user-facing error message.\r\nPrevious state:\r\n```\r\nSELECT CAST('a' AS INT)\r\norg.apache.spark.SparkNumberFormatException: [CAST_INVALID_INPUT] The value 'a' of the type \"STRING\" cannot be cast to \"INT\" because it is malformed. Correct the value as per the syntax, or change its target type. Use `try_cast` to tolerate malformed input and return NULL instead. If necessary set \"spark.sql.ansi.enabled\" to \"false\" to bypass this error.\r\nSELECT CAST(2147483648L AS INT);\r\norg.apache.spark.SparkArithmeticException: [CAST_OVERFLOW] The value 2147483648L of the type \"BIGINT\" cannot be cast to \"INT\" due to an overflow. Use `try_cast` to tolerate overflow and return NULL instead. If necessary set \"spark.sql.ansi.enabled\" to \"false\" to bypass this error.\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrent state:\r\n```\r\nSELECT CAST('a' AS INT)\r\norg.apache.spark.SparkNumberFormatException: [CAST_INVALID_INPUT] The value 'a' of the type \"STRING\" cannot be cast to \"INT\" because it is malformed. Correct the value as per the syntax, or change its target type. Use `try_cast` to tolerate malformed input and return NULL instead.\r\nSELECT CAST(2147483648L AS INT);\r\norg.apache.spark.SparkArithmeticException: [CAST_OVERFLOW] The value 2147483648L of the type \"BIGINT\" cannot be cast to \"INT\" due to an overflow. Use `try_cast` to tolerate overflow and return NULL instead.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests check for existence of ansiConfig message parameter.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-09-10T06:55:03Z","updated_at":"2024-09-11T13:11:04Z","closed_at":"2024-09-11T13:11:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"84abdc8e00ad4d089b2130dd52483e333f377797","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48054/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48054/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48054/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/51cea66e3c00a57126a8c8b036e69c05f85d7295","head":{"label":"mihailom-db:ANSI-errors","ref":"ANSI-errors","sha":"51cea66e3c00a57126a8c8b036e69c05f85d7295","user":{"login":"mihailom-db","id":159067682,"node_id":"U_kgDOCXsuIg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/159067682?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db","html_url":"https://github.com/mihailom-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":756245919,"node_id":"R_kgDOLRNlnw","name":"spark","full_name":"mihailom-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mihailom-db","id":159067682,"node_id":"U_kgDOCXsuIg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/159067682?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db","html_url":"https://github.com/mihailom-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihailom-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mihailom-db/spark","description":"Apache
