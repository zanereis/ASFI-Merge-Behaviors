just for reference, not meant to be merged)\r\n\r\nJMH benchmarks on reading field values from `RowWithGetters`. This is meant to establish a baseline for the current code on master.\r\n\r\n[Here's a visualization](https://jmh.morethan.io/?sources=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/beam/3b5e1d607d30397abb27a119fc30c5d05a7b2d40/sdks/java/harness/jmh/RowWithGetters-master-cache-disabled.json,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/beam/3b5e1d607d30397abb27a119fc30c5d05a7b2d40/sdks/java/harness/jmh/RowWithGetters-master-cache-enabled-lazy-init.json) of the results for master comparing two benchmark runs reading field values once & three times with \r\n* caching disabled.\r\n* caching enabled (using lazy initialisation of the cache data structure). \r\n\r\nNOTE:\r\n* The score doesn't reflect read access only, measurement includes iterating over a large number of rows. What matters are the relative changes.\r\n* You cannot easily compare scores between different benchmarks as rows contain different number of fields. Also, depending on types, fields are read recursively to measure the impact of lazy vs eager data structures.\r\n* Any cache initialization is done lazily on first read (if caching is enabled) to include associated costs in the measurement.\r\n\r\nEach benchmark method invocation processes a bundle of 50k rows and\r\nrecursively reads all values per row. The rows are created upfront using JMH `State` to\r\nexclude any initialization costs from the measurement. To prevent unintended cache hits in `RowWithGetters` a new bundle of rows must be generated before every invocation.\r\n\r\nUsing state setup per `Level#Invocation` has significant drawbacks by itself! Though,\r\ngiven that reading bundles of 50k rows takes well above 1 ms, each\r\nindividual invocation can be adequately timestamped without risking generating wrong results.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

is a follow up to #17162. An `AbstractWindmillStream` can create more than one grpc stream during its lifetime, new streams can be created after client closed for sending pending requests. So it is not correct to check `if(clientClosed)` in `send()`, this PR adds a new grpc stream level boolean to do the closed check in `send()`.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR adds initial support for https://s.apache.org/batched-dofns to the Python SDK. The only entirely new module is `apache_beam.typehints.batch` which adds support for registering `BatchConverter` implementations that can convert between element and batch types (see [\"Batched Type Converters\" in the design](https://s.apache.org/batched-dofns#heading=h.n1mqgxv7oqj7)). The rest of the PR includes changes to `DoFn` (add a `process_batch` method which can be overriden), as well as \"construction-time\" changes to `Pipeline`, `PCollection`, `ParDo` and friends to support checking types and resolving `BatchConverter` instances. There are also wide ranging changes to `apache_beam.runners.worker` to recognize these constructs and create/explode batches between Operations as necessary.\r\n\r\nNote this is still a WIP - there are a number of TODOs in the current implementation that I am continuing to address as part of this PR. I also need to add more test coverage (currently there's just one end-to-end test in `FnRunnerTest`).\r\n\r\nThere are also some planned larger improvements to this framework that will be left for future PRs:\r\n- This implementation assumes `process_batch` always yields batches and `process` always yields elements. We will add `@DoFn.yields_batches` and `@DoFn.yields_elements` decorators to override this default behavior.\r\n- \"batch\" versions of `DoFn.*Param` as described [here](https://s.apache.org/batched-dofns#heading=h.th8he6p84ja).\r\n- The ability to have more complex batching preferences (e.g. time-based, size-based, linear regression as in BatchElements, etc). Currently either the entire bundle is batched or nothing.\r\n\r\nGitHub Actions Tests Status (on master

has been incredibly helpful for debugging performance issues (specifically GC related) in jobs.  When GC thrashing is detected, we now record a JFR profile (for a duration set by `--jfrRecordingDurationSec`, 60 seconds by default) and upload it to GCS (to the same path as set by `--saveHeapDumpsToGcsPath`).\r\n\r\nAgain not sure who to get to review this, @lukecwik maybe you or you can pass it off to someone else?\r\n\r\nAlso, side note, it looks like this class also now exists in the FnHarness code too.

avoid not having the information available and to guarantee we use the same coder for element encoding and decoding of the reshuffled elements.\r\n\r\nNote, technically only using the same coder ID did work for the affected runners, however that relies on the original pipeline coder components to be available on all bundle descriptors, which is also brittle.\r\n\r\nAdds regression tests for revealing the issue, and unit tests to add some (but not complete) coverage to the new reshuffle behavior.\r\n\r\nAffected runners were Dataflow, Python Portable and the google internal runner. Flink and Spark were unaffected.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR, currently work-in-progress, closes [BEAM-14035](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-14035) by:\r\n- Creating a `BigQuerySchemaIOConfiguration` configuration that models Query, Extract, or Load BigQuery jobs\r\n- Creating a `BigQuerySchemaTransform` implementation of `SchemaTransform`\r\n- Refactoring `BigQuerySchemaIOProvider` as an extension of `TypedSchemaTransformProvider<BigQuerySchemaIOConfiguration>`\r\n- Creating a `BigQueryRowReader` implementation of `PTransform<PBegin, PCollectionRowTuple>`\r\n\r\nRemaining work is:\r\n- Update `BigQueryRowReader` to handle an Extract BigQuery job\r\n- Create a `BigQueryRowWriter` implementation of `PTransform<PCollectionRowTuple, PDone>`\r\n- Update `BigQuerySchemaIOConfiguration` with Load Job configuration properties\r\n- Tests using FakeBigQuery services (initial attempt failed)\r\n\r\nI would like to request @laraschmidt to review this PR or delegate where

coders have significant overhead due to the usage of `DataInputStream`.  DataInputStream allocates a significant amount of internal buffers when instantiated, which adds unnecessary overhead for very simple operations like decoding a big-endian long.\r\n\r\nThis changes most coders that use DataInputStream internally to use a more optimized big-endian decoder.  I actually benchmarked three different options here, the solution I arrived at was the best mix of performance and allocations.\r\n\r\n```\r\nBenchmark                Mode  Cnt          Score         Error  Units\r\nreadLongViaLocalBuffer  thrpt   10  204364633.343 ± 7412002.528  ops/s\r\nreadLongViaTLBuffer     thrpt   10  108663164.381 ±  229471.991  ops/s\r\nreadLongViaReadCalls    thrpt   10  160694853.195 ± 5272248.704  ops/s\r\n```\r\n\r\nreadLongViaLocalBuffer allocates an 8 byte buffer per call and reads it using a single read() call.\r\nreadLongViaTLBuffer does the same, but uses a thread-local buffer rather than allocating a new one each call.\r\nreadLongViaReadCalls simply calls read 8 times, storing the results in temporary variables.\r\n\r\nR: @lukecwik  maybe?

Adds the 'Manage Clusters' option under the Interactive Beam JupyterLab extension to enable users to manage Interactive Beam clusters. Users are presented with the functionality to:\r\n  - View all clusters managed by Interactive Beam.\r\n  - Delete a selected cluster - deleting a cluster will call the ib.cleanup() routine for each pipeline associated with a given cluster \r\nand clear the master_url saved in the options of the pipelines. Upon re-running the pipelines with the original pipeline options, the deleted cluster will be recreated.\r\n  - Select a default cluster - this will make any future pipelines that do not have a Flink master_url and no specified Google Cloud project use this cluster.\r\n- ASF Jira thread: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-14130\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

is a significant restructuring that relies on the new java-pubsublite version which exposes the ability to fail clients on duplicate connection detections.\r\n\r\nOffsetByteRangeTracker no longer rejects splits to ensure throughput- instead it uses an OffsetRangeTracker and accepts all system checkpoints.\r\n\r\nSubscribers now buffer memory in the background, respecting a MemoryLimiter which tries to constrain the aggregate memory outstanding to 500 MiB without potentially starving any individual partition.
