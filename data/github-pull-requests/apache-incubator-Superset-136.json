CATEGORY\r\n\r\nChoose one\r\n\r\n- [x] Bug Fix\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (new features, refinement)\r\n- [ ] Refactor\r\n- [ ] Add tests\r\n- [ ] Build / Development Environment\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nWhen I authored https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/4905 I updated the [`pandas.pivot_table`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.pivot_table.html) calls to not drop the `NaN` (`NULL`) values as per the documentation,\r\n\r\n> dropna : boolean, default True\r\n> Do not include columns whose entries are all NaN\r\n\r\nas I wanted to ensure that `NaN`'s were preserved.\r\n\r\nThe issue with this is pivots (cross-product) may result in combinations where the values are all `NaN` which pollutes the chart. I misread the important _all_  which means that only empty combinations are removed, i.e., `NaN`s from the original data-frame are preserved (where necessary), i.e., for [this](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/21969#issuecomment-440324188) example,  \r\n\r\n#### Current \r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> df.pivot_table(index=['x', 'y'], columns='parameter_id', values='result_value', dropna=False)\r\nparameter_id    a    b    c   d\r\nx y                            \r\n0 0           3.0  1.0  3.0 NaN\r\n  1           1.0  3.0  NaN NaN\r\n  2           1.0  3.0  NaN NaN\r\n1 0           1.0  3.0  NaN NaN\r\n  1           NaN  NaN  NaN NaN\r\n  2           NaN  NaN  NaN NaN\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Proposed (Revert)\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> df.pivot_table(index=['x', 'y'], columns='parameter_id', values='result_value')\r\nparameter_id    a    b    c\r\nx y                        \r\n0 0           3.0  1.0  3.0\r\n  1           1.0  3.0  NaN\r\n  2           1.0  3.0  NaN\r\n1 0           1.0  3.0  NaN\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote in this example the `d` column is `NaN` for all values and has been dropped which could be problematic under certain visualization types. @mistercrunch any thoughts on  this?\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\nCI.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are

This PR build upon this PR and removes the need for a `main` database connection to the metadata database. Note that this `main` connection database still get created for unit testing purposes, but that should probably get deprecated in favor of leveraging the `examples` database for unit tests.\r\n\r\n###

This used to throw a 500 because `one()` expected a query with that `results_key` to exist.\r\n\r\nNow, it will return a generic error if no query exists. \r\n\r\nAs a possible future fix for this error, we could use the information in the query object within the `blob` instead of looking up the corresponding query.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nTested on devbox.

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nI came across a bug in `viz.py` where [`get_csv`](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/blob/8cd8ec16d5017076b639a76514069cc276f930ad/superset/viz.py#L489) which uses logic like, \r\n\r\n```\r\ndef get_csv(self):\r\n    df = self.get_df()\r\n    include_index = not isinstance(df.index, pd.RangeIndex)\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\ni.e., it assumes that `df` is of type `pd.DataFrame` whereas it can optionally be `None`. Going forward I'm not sure what the correct logic should be but I've added basic type hints to the `get_df(...)` method to inform developers that it can be either a `pd.DataFrame` or `None`. Note this PR does not fix the bug.\r\n\r\nNote my preference would be for `get_df(...)` to only return a `pd.DataFrame`, that way we wouldn't need to write logic like `if df is None` in numerous places. One question is if `df` is `None` should the return value from `get_csv()` be `None` or should it be a serialized empty `pd.DataFrame`?\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\nCI.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL

CATEGORY\r\n\r\nChoose one\r\n\r\n- [x] Bug Fix\r\n- [x] Enhancement (new features, refinement)\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nPreviously `deck_polygon` elevation only worked with old school metrics or fixed values. PR #7924 added support for ad-hoc metrics, but broke support for old-school metrics. This PR makes all elevation types work (ad-hoc metric, oldschool metric and fixed), and adds a few bells and whistles to the example chart, namely coloring based on total population + legend formatting as introduced in #7951 . Also, JS data mutator logic is moved to native elements.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/62835528-2da33b80-bc62-11e9-9b53-dcef44f9a89c.png)\r\n\r\n###

When a regression is introduced (or deprecated feature is removed) in a more recent version than specified in `requirements.txt`, this often causes problems for end users. Some examples that come to mind: `pandas==0.24.0` (private method renamed/made public, `DateOffset` made immutable), `gunicorn==19.9.0` (regression from `19.8`). This test aims to make sure that a `pip` convenience release of Superset works properly.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TEST

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nAfter https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/7084 slices can no longer have whitespace as a name. This means that there's no way to remove the title from a slice in a dashboard. This PR removes the `<empty>` text from a slice when viewing it in a dashboard.\r\n\r\nThis also prevents you from saving a slice with whitespace as a title.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nBefore:\r\n![Screen Shot 2019-08-09 at 10 20 41 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7409244/62797099-aef6a480-ba8f-11e9-9349-c4051bf71033.png)\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n![Screen Shot 2019-08-09 at 10 20 23 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7409244/62797108-b28a2b80-ba8f-11e9-828d-759382ae21e6.png)\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\nView slices with and without titles in dashboards.

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nbefore #7248, dashboard viewers and owners can auto refresh dashboard periodically, but this refresh frequency can not be saved into dashboard metadata. In #7248, dashboard owner can change refresh frequency and save it as part of dashboard metadata, so that next time viewer open dashboard, it will auto-refresh per owner's setting. But in this PR, viewers lost their options to change refresh frequency, even they doesn't want to change owner's setting. There are some cases where dashboard owner didn't set auto refresh, but viewers still want to auto refresh during current visit.\r\n\r\nThis PR added back this feature:\r\n- dashboard viewers can trigger auto refresh for this visit, but this change won't persist.\r\n- In edit mode, if dashboard owner changes auto refresh frequency, this change will be saved into dashboard metadata.\r\n\r\n###

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nIssue: When Superset is running behind a reverse proxy and the dashboard page is requested with HTTPS protocol, the frontend can't retrieve the favorite status of the dashboard and, instead, displays the following toast message: 'There was an issue fetching the favorite status of this dashboard.'\r\n\r\nCause: While the API exposes the /favestar/Dashboard/{id}/count/ endpoint, the frontend executes an API call to /favestar/Dashboard/{id}/count, which leads to a redirect to an endpoint with HTTP protocol\r\n\r\nFix: Call the correct endpoint\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\n\r\n###

CATEGORY\r\n\r\nChoose one\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bug Fix\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (new features, refinement)\r\n- [ ] Refactor\r\n- [ ] Add tests\r\n- [X] Build / Development Environment\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nWhen running a Docker version of superset, the previously recommended way to initialize the db was to exec into the running container _locally_ while executing against production configuration and then manually executing the `flask fab admin-create` command. This was not a sustainable pattern and I wanted to create a better solution that behaved more like a CI deployment. \r\n* This adds some python scripts that will execute the admin command\r\n* It looks for a secrets provider and falls back to env variables\r\n* Provides some examples of env setup and superset_config.py\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n* Setup a bare db to be your new environment (this usually means already having created users/schemas etc.)\r\n* Configure your docker.env file to have the connection details for this db\r\n* Build the container\r\n* You can run it locally (just to verify) or you can deploy it out to ECS or similar\r\n* The expected results are that all steps to initialize superset are executed in a hands off manner and you can log in when all is said and done.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated

Environment\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nWhile working with a large, non-curated and diverse database consisting of many columns and rows per table I found myself **painfully** trying to distinguish null values from actual strings/numbers.\r\n\r\nWhatsmore, by sorting columns that were supposed to be numerical, the **null values sometimes took precedence over the order** when I was trying to sort said columns.\r\n\r\n- If the value of a cell is null, it shows as NULL (italic and light gray) to easily distinguish it from other values in the results table.\r\n- When sorting a column with NULL values, NULL values always come last regardless of the sorting order.\r\n\r\nMore information can be found in Issue #7983 (Better Visualization and Sorting for NULL values)\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n**Before change** when sorting by ascending order for **totaltracks**

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nDeprecate EVENT_LOGGER assignment of class type in favor of instance. Deprecation is handled gracefully and only outputs a WARNING log message at config load time.  We have a need to configure an impl of AbstractEventLogger which is instantiated/pre-configured with some proprietary dependencies.\r\n\r\nThis change is a small refactor on top of the nice change #7705 @dpgaspar made a few weeks ago.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nUnit tests added, and tested manually.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT:

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/7782 changed the behavior of the `presto.latest_partition` Jinja template function to return an array instead of a string, breaking all sql metrics/slices that used it. This PR makes the `latest_partition` function behave the same as prior to this change, introduces a new function `presto.latest_partitions` that can be used with this new behavior, and provides documentation for the change in code.\r\n\r\nIt might be worth renaming these functions if we were ever to do a breaking release of superset, but i don't see that happening any time soon.\r\n\r\n###

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nHaving all the registration logic in `superset/__init__.py` results in some complex cyclical logic (not I really like the model that the [cookiecutter-flask](https://github.com/cookiecutter-flask/cookiecutter-flask/blob/master/%7B%7Bcookiecutter.app_name%7D%7D/%7B%7Bcookiecutter.app_name%7D%7D/app.py) package uses where the cache etc. are registered as extensions and available prior to the instantiation of the app) though this may be a limitation of using Flask-AppBuilder. \r\n\r\nIt't not apparent what order we should register certain logic but we've run into an issue using Blueprints where we wanted to reference the cache which need to be defined prior to the registration of the blueprints. \r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\nCI.

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/issues/7966, where the Time-series Period Pivot visualization is broken because of changes to the Pandas API:\r\n\r\n1. `DateOffset` is now immutable, so we can't set it to normalized after it's been created. I fixed this my making a copy and normalizing it during the process.\r\n2. Having an index with the same name as a column now raises an exception. I fixed this by removing the name of the index (since we don't use it).\r\n\r\nI'm not very familiar with Pandas, so I'm not sure if this is the right approach.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nI compared visualizations that we have in production at Lyft (running the old code that still works), and the ones created with this PR are identical.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes -->\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include

CATEGORY\r\n\r\nChoose one\r\n\r\n- [x] Refactor\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nThe function that replaces the query limit assumed that the limit number comes two tokens after the keyword. This was the case for `sqlparse==0.2.4`, but stopped working when bumped to `sqlparse==0.3.0`. This makes the function slightly more robust by using native `sqlparse` functionality to find the next non-whitespace token after the limit keyword. The new code works equally well with `0.2.4`, but I figured it's just as well to bump to the newest version.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n- Unit tests.\r\n\r\n### REVIEWERS\r\n@john-bodley @betodealmeida

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis PR adds doc-strings and type hints to the security manager to help to provide more context and consistency. Note I've tried to ensure that the code remains unchanged however: \r\n\r\n1. I renamed a couple of methods/variables for accuracy. Note further polish could be applied. \r\n2. Given the vast number of methods in the `SupersetSecurityManager` (it's becoming almost intractable) I renamed private methods with a leading `_` (underscore). \r\n3. The Mypy type hints surfaced a couple of small issues during linting. \r\n\r\nA few notes/observations: \r\n\r\n1. I get the sense there's too many surfaces where security datasource checks happen (many occur on the view) and thus we susceptible for potentially forgetting to add them for new routes. Moving forward it seems like these checks should probably occur closer to the engine where appropriate.\r\n2. I've tried to be as descriptive as possible but it took me quite some time to decipher what the various objects were. There may be merit in the future of being more explicit between Druid datasources and SQL tables. \r\n3. I think some of the private methods could probably be refactored. \r\n4. The SQL table names seem to be a mess, currently these can be defined as:\r\n\r\n- `str`: `[[cluster.]schema.]table`\r\n- `Tuple[str, str]`: `(schema, table)`\r\n- `DatasourceName`\r\n\r\nI believe there would be merit in aligning on one mechanism for defining SQL tables throughout Superset to help mitigate bugs/inaccuracies (note we've addresses issues related to this in the past). This is especially vital as it relates to security and a hardened security model should be one of Superset's core tenets.  A `dataclass` class may be a viable route. \r\n\r\n5. I'm not certain whether the `get_schema_perm` logic is correct as I believe that the `database` parameter can be `Union[Database, str]`. I'm not sure if that was intentional \r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\nCI.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nAdds a top-level dashboard loading indicator (originally opened as https://github.com/airbnb/incubator-superset/pull/143)\r\n\r\nToday, we show loading indicators overlaying each chart on the dashboard, but we don't show a top-level indicator for the full dashboard. This is problematic because the loading indicators are sometimes easy to miss (e.g., loading is happening in other dashboard sub-tabs, or loading indicator on chart has low-contrast).\r\n\r\n**Additional Background**:\r\nI use Superset heavily (on the Airbnb Human Team), and have been working with non-engs that use these dashboards frequently. I keep getting feedback on different perf-related issues, and I feel like it's eroding their trust in the data. \r\n\r\nI'm throwing up this \"central\" loading indicator to make it clearer that no more \"loading\" is taking place on the dashboard, so they can hopefully have more confidence that the numbers are \"ready\". (Before this, they would toggle dashboard filters, and the chart-by-chart loading indicators would cause them to feel unsure whether the data is ready to be interpreted.)\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nThis PR is to resume the work in #7449. For some security concerns, we need to enforce CSRF protection on query request to `explore_json` endpoint.  \r\n\r\nSo I want to add a new feature flag: `ENABLE_EXPLORE_JSON_CSRF_PROTECTION`. When `ENABLE_EXPLORE_JSON_CSRF_PROTECTION` is set to true, user cannot make GET request to `explore_json`. \r\n\r\nThe default value for this feature `False` (current behavior), explore_json accepts both GET and POST request.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nsend GET request to `explore_json`, you will get `405 Method Not Allowed` exception.\r\n\r\n\r\n### REVIEWERS\r\n@DiggidyDave @betodealmeida

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis is a partial revert of https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/7888 where it was discovered that this breaks [filter_values](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/blob/4568b2a532069bdd5595c8f79a55d20e6326f9e4/superset/jinja_context.py#L87) logic (which is used within custom SQL views and can reference columns not present in the UI) which simply ignores invalid filters. By raising an exception prematurely one could cause functional charts to break.\r\n\r\nPersonally I think the long term fix is to rethink the filter logic however this is non-trivial and thus in the interim reverting the logic for raising on invalid filters is being reverted. \r\n\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\nCI. \r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\"

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe bug was introduced by #7102\r\n\r\nUsing `position:absolute` on body gives `document.documentElement` a height of 0 which propagates to `clientHeight` on Firefox. This leads to a wrong calculation of the tooltip position in NVD3.\r\n\r\nThe solution proposed here is to use `min-height: 100vh` instead of the current technique for stretching the body element to the full window height, thus keeping body and html together.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\nAccess an NVD3

CATEGORY\r\n\r\nChoose one\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bug Fix\r\n- [x] Enhancement (new features, refinement)\r\n- [x] Refactor\r\n- [x] Add tests\r\n- [ ] Build / Development Environment\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\n1. Show indicator on each chart which filter can apply and what filter values are applied\r\n2. Allow user navigate from chart to any of its applicable filter.\r\n\r\n### Implementation\r\n\r\n- Refactor `filters` in redux state.\r\n\r\nBefore this PR, `filters` state is a sub-state in `dashboardstate`:\r\n```\r\ndashboard redux state:\r\n\r\n{\r\n    datasources,\r\n    sliceEntities,\r\n    charts,\r\n    dashboardInfo,\r\n    dashboardState: {\r\n      ...\r\n      filters: {\r\n        124: {\r\n           __time_range: 'Last quarter',\r\n        },\r\n        131: {\r\n           gender: ['boy', 'girl'],\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n      ...\r\n    },\r\n    dashboardLayout,\r\n    messageToasts: [],\r\n    impressionId: shortid.generate(),\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIn order to support UI features and in-dashboard navigation functionality, I move **`dashboardFilter`** up to be **root-level state** in redux store, and it will contain more props about filter value and its layout information:\r\n```\r\ndashboard redux state:\r\n\r\n{\r\n    datasources,\r\n    sliceEntities,\r\n    charts,\r\n    dashboardInfo,\r\n    dashboardState,\r\n    dashboardFilters: {\r\n      124: {\r\n        chartId: 124,\r\n        componentId: \"CHART-CHTxAXRuJW\",\r\n        directPathToFilter: [\r\n          'ROOT_ID',\r\n          'TABS-VPEX_c476g',\r\n          'TAB-1bnpXJkoS8',\r\n          'ROW-qc1WPC4bOn',\r\n          'CHART-CHTxAXRuJW'\r\n        ],\r\n        scope: \"ROOT_ID\",\r\n        isDateFilter: true,\r\n        isInstantFilter: true,\r\n        columns: {\r\n          __time_range(pin): \"Last quarter\",\r\n        }\r\n      },\r\n      131: {\r\n        ...\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n    dashboardLayout,\r\n    messageToasts: [],\r\n    impressionId: shortid.generate(),\r\n}\r\n```\r\nBecause `filters` prop is used by a lot of components in dashboard, I added a converter utility function [`buildActiveFilters`](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/blob/2e92ec9ade844866932a721e6b486fbf8b8df0ef/superset/assets/src/dashboard/util/activeDashboardFilters.js#L19), which converts raw `dashboardFilters` state into old `filters` format so that other components can still use `filters` as before, and won't be affected by this big state change. \r\n\r\n`buildActiveFilters` function will be triggered whenever dashboardFilters state is changed, and the converted results will be cached. All other components in dashboard will call `getActiveFilters` to get the cached filters state, and they don't need to run the converter function again and again.\r\n\r\n- Color assignment\r\n\r\nIn this PR we introduced a new [color palette ](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/blob/2e92ec9ade844866932a721e6b486fbf8b8df0ef/superset/assets/src/dashboard/stylesheets/variables.less#L41) for dashboard filters.\r\n\r\nEach filter field is assigned a unique colorKey: `chartId_filter_column_name`. This colorKey is used by bother filter badge and filter indicator. Dashboard will pick a color from filter color palette based on colorKey and build a color map.  During render time, each filter and indicators in the chart will lookup color code based on its colorKey. Similar to `buildActiveFilters` function, dashboardFilter state update will trigger re-build color map.\r\n\r\n- In-dashboard navigation\r\n![tree1-2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27990562/61979193-0da82280-afa8-11e9-9735-cd5c4435cc1e.jpg)\r\n\r\nSuppose A is root, B,C,D are top level tabs, F, G are charts under tabs, H is nested tab, M is chart under nested tab. For example, when user lands on M, how to navigate user to a _filter_ component in another root level tab B?\r\n\r\nDashboard stores layout data in flattened tree structure: each parent node contains ids of its children, and every UI component (chart, header, row, column, tabs, etc) keeps all the parent component ids from root to itself (see #6945):\r\n```\r\n  'CHART-PuHBPak5nl': {\r\n    children: [],\r\n    id: 'CHART-PuHBPak5nl',\r\n    meta: {\r\n      chartId: 146,\r\n      height: 50,\r\n      sliceName: 'Chart B2',\r\n      width: 4\r\n    },\r\n    parents: [\r\n      'ROOT_ID',\r\n      'TABS-nGgMw9Fmmj',\r\n      'TAB-YWfqbvBaqp',\r\n      'TABS-cGWCi1V-mr',\r\n      'TAB-CZxYwmgZZ',\r\n      'ROW-iC9LI5XSxU'\r\n    ],\r\n    type: 'CHART'\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nFrom this parents list it's very easy to find out to select which root tab or nested tab to a specific filter. `dashboardState` has a `directPathToChild` prop, which is the current state of dashboard, holding a path to one of the chart (or any UI component).  When user clicks on a filter indicator, dashboard will update its `directPathToChild` to be target filter's path. Then dashboard will render the correct list of parent tab/tabs, and display filter chart.\r\n\r\n- Filter indicators UI components\r\n\r\n  - Container component: `/dashboard/container/FilterIndicators.jsx`\r\n  - `/dashboard/components/FilterIndicatorsContainer.jsx`: indicators organizer for each chart. Usually one chart will be applicable for one or more filters, but user can set dashboard metadata that a chart might be immune to all filters in the dashboard, or some filter fields. We only display indicators for _applicable_ filters. The logic to show/group/hide applicable filters for each chart is here.\r\n   - `/dashboard/components/FilterIndicator.jsx` and `/dashboard/components/FilterIndicatorGroup.jsx`: little colored indicator component for each filter, if chart having > 5 filters, will group them into a group. \r\n<img width=\"382\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-08-08 at 11 46 05 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27990562/62729113-249c3b00-b9d2-11e9-89eb-b1d0c7c40d83.png\">\r\n\r\n  - `/dashboard/components/FilterTooltipWrapper.jsx`: the basic usage of `react-bootstrap Tooltip` components are not enough for our need. We allow user to click on tooltip (especially needed for indicator group) to navigate to actual filter chart. So I added customized wrapper component to trigger/hide `Overlay` with some delay.\r\n  - `/dashboard/components/FilterIndicatorTooltip.jsx`: tooltip component for filter. it shows `column name` and selected values. \r\n<img width=\"999\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-07-26 at 2 53 04 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27990562/61983458-47335a80-afb5-11e9-9118-f28961fc1666.png\">\r\nIf the filter is applicable but not applied, we will show **Not filtered**.\r\nIf the filter is not applicable to the chart, we will not show indicator.\r\n\r\n### SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n**Page landing**: \r\n\r\n- each filter field is assigned a badge with unique color.\r\n\r\n\r\n![NXB4w4V9OB](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27990562/61613121-44cbac00-ac15-11e9-8eb4-d85c53e29768.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Interact with filter indicator**\r\n\r\n- Hover on chart, you will see filter indicators popping out. The color bar in the filter indicator matched with filter's badge color.\r\n- Hover on filter indicator, it will show filter's name and selected value(s), as filter tooltip.\r\n- We show at most 5 filter indicators for each chart. For charts that having more filters, its indicators will be grouped in the last spot.\r\n- For immune chart, it doesn't have any filter indicator.\r\n- For chart with immune fields, we only show indicators for applicable fields.\r\n\r\n![dKRnGt8z0n](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27990562/61614771-69298780-ac19-11e9-9cdc-8e713ff70a4e.gif)\r\n\r\n**Navigate from chart to filter**\r\n\r\n- When user clicks on one of filter indicator, or click on pencil icon in the filter tooltip, page will navigate to the chart, even cross tabs.\r\n- The selected filter chart will be highlighted with green border. \r\n- If the chart has more than 1 field, the user selected field will be highlighted.\r\n\r\n\r\n![8KuUojNgUB](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27990562/61615403-c70a9f00-ac1a-11e9-8b3e-00073bb02b57.gif)\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nCI and manual test.\r\n\r\n###

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nWhen user save dashboard, we allow user do not user original slice_name saved in Slice table, and have a copy of slice name which is only used by a dashboard. We also allow user to set this dashboard's slice name be empty.\r\n\r\nin front-end code i think we copy slice_name into layout data and send with save_dash API. But in unit tests we didn't set slicename attribute in the mock layout data, and cause after /save_dash/ api call in unit test, sample slices created for unit tests lost their slice_name. So that some unit tests that rely on slice_name uniqueness became flacky.\r\n\r\n**Solution**\r\nI fixed the logic in save_dash. It will only reset slice_name when has explicit attribute in layout.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nCI\r\n\r\n\r\n### REVIEWERS\r\n@john-bodley @mistercrunch

CATEGORY\r\n\r\nChoose one\r\n\r\n- [x] Bug Fix\r\n- [x] Refactor\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nTL;DR:\r\n\r\nThere is a bug in how the `prequeries` property of `query_obj` is constructed in `sqla/models.py`, which causes cache misses if there are more than one filter selected in FilterBox. This PR fixes that bug without introducing any (user facing) functional changes.\r\n\r\nLong explanation:\r\n\r\nWhen non-join based prequeries were introduced in #4163, the properties `is_prequery` and `prequeries` were introduced into `query_obj`. This was done to be able to produce \"Top N\" filtering for engines that don't support joins, namely Druid (and later Pinot). However, prequeries are not actually needed in the `query_obj` (and later `cache_dict`), as they are only an intermediary construct that can be deduced from the `query_obj`. Furthermore, prequeries were  added to `query_obj` in `sqla_models.py`, making the calls non-idempotent and non-deterministic. Ideally `query_obj` should never be mutated after it is constructed in `viz.py`, as all the information necessary for the query should already be known at that time. This caused a caching bug in Filterbox, which runs as many queries as there are filters, and erroneously interpreted the previous queries as prequeries, causing bloated `prequeries` properties in the `query_obj`.\r\n\r\n When Pinot support was introduced in #6719, two named tuples (`SqlaQuery` and `QueryStrExtended`) were introduced in `sqla/models.py` to facilitate returning more context for how a query that produces the resulting `DataFrame` were produced. In the current codebase, this is the correct placeholder for prequeries. This PR removes both `is_prequery` and `prequeries` from `query_obj`, and adds `prequeries` into the `SqlaQuery` and `QueryStrExtended` objects, enabling the functionality introduced in #4163.\r\n\r\nFunctional changes:\r\n- Removed `prequeries` and `is_prequery` from `query_obj`.\r\n- Moved prequery related handling from `query_obj` to `SqlaQuery` and `QueryStrExtended`, ensuring that `query_obj` stays unmutated during processing in `sqla/models.py`.\r\n\r\nOther refactoring:\r\n- Renamed property `inner_joins` in `BaseEngineSpec` to `allows_joins` (currently not necessary to distinguish between inner/outer/full joins). Also harmonized other similarly named properties, such as `allows_subqueries` and `allows_column_aliases`.\r\n- Added typing to `SqlaQuery`and `QueryStrExtended`.\r\n- Moved some query formatting from `core.py` to `sqla/models.py`.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n- CI\r\n- Tested locally by setting `allows_joins` to both `True` and `False` on `sqlite`\r\n- Verified that no more cache misses occur when running Filterbox with more than one filter.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [x] Has associated issue: Fixes #7666\r\n\r\n###

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nWhen filter is changed, chart shows a loading icon, but not fetching data.\r\n\r\nIn Dashboard component, the logic to trigger chart refresh has problem. It only checks if whole chart is immune, but not check if chart immune to curtain fields in a applied filter. \r\nAfter chart is triggered to refresh, its state changed from success to loading, so we show loading icon for the chart. But the effective filter for the chart is not changed (because filter is not applicable). At the result, chart didn't send new query, but since the chart did not change state any more, the chart's loading status will not disappear.\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

Incorrect owner causes an inability to modify (override) charts.\r\n\r\n#### Allow to pass user for dashboard import cli\r\n\r\nDashboard import assigns a current user from flask context during import.\r\nBut in the case of cli import, there is no flask user and imported charts\r\ndon't have an owner which prevents the ability to edit them.\r\n\r\n#### Use ORM to decode dashboards json\r\n\r\nCreating instances using ORM allows normally work with relations (set the owner).\r\n\r\n#### Reset ownership on dashboard import\r\n\r\nFor overriding existing charts it requires `owners` property to be set.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\n1. Import a dashboard using UI/CLI with `--username` flag\r\n2. Validate the dashboard and slices have correct `created_by`, `modified_by`, `owners` fields\r\n3. Validate the charts can be modified and saved with overriding\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing

That cause the following test that compares each slice attribute, like viz_type, failed.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nci\r\n\r\n\r\n### REVIEWERS\r\n@john-bodley @mistercrunch @michellethomas

ignored and the the query would execute sans the filter with no clear indication to the user that the filter wasn't being applied. \r\n\r\nThis PR applies the same logic as invalid metrics and raises an exception if the column is invalid. Note I added unit tests to cover both the invalid metric and column use cases.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n##### BEFORE \r\n![Screen Shot 2019-07-17 at 3 32 12

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nSuperset didn't have unique constraint on dashboard_sliced table. In dashboard front-end code and when saving dashboard data to db, we added logic to prevent same slice id added into dashboard, but still found some duplicated entries in the dashboard_slices table. \r\n\r\nWhen user tried to remove the duplicated slice_id from dashboard, they will see following error, and they cannot remove that duplicated slice:\r\n![Screen Shot 2018-11-20 at 1 19 54 PM

dashboard_slices\r\n2. add unique constraint\r\n3. update the dashboard_slices model to include the uniqueness constraint \r\n\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nrun following query from database, should get 0

Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis PR makes export respect export_fields and doesn't export\r\nunnecessary relations (like users with passwords hashes) which are\r\nignored during the import.\r\n\r\nIt also allows to import dashboards without position_json.\r\nIn case charts were added from chart-edit page and weren't re-ordered on\r\nthe dashboard, position_json field is empty and import was failing with\r\nerror.\r\n\r\n~~Tests for cache rely on the modification of database state by other\r\nunit-tests.\r\nPreviously, import_export_tests were removing some dashboards and slices\r\ncreated by load_examples_test. Now export doesn't modify original\r\ninstances in the DB and slices are preserved.~~\r\n(test was removed in another PR)\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER JSON\r\n\r\nExported json for the same dashboard with only 1 chart.\r\n\r\nBefore 238 lines, contains password hash of the admin user:\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/smacker/ab2f3e0ed08fa2f70279a963e14bc48e\r\n\r\nAfter 144 lines, contains only necessary information:\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/smacker/856d0231c11ab846ed9a3c8b516cea5f\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n\r\nExport & import a dashboard using UI or cli command.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL

CATEGORY\r\n\r\nChoose one\r\n\r\n- [x] Bug Fix\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (new features, refinement)\r\n- [ ] Refactor\r\n- [ ] Add tests\r\n- [ ] Build / Development Environment\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nThe metrics control has functionality to remove metrics if the columns or savedMetrics used has changed and the field no longer exists. We are not handling custom sql metrics correctly in this process, so whenever a datasource is edited the custom sql metric will be removed from the metrics control. \r\n\r\n`columnNames` in `columnsContainAllMetrics` is a set of column name strings, so `columnNames.has(name)` is expecting a string, but in the case of the sql metric it will be an object. In the future we may want to consider parsing the sql to find the column names to check if they exist, but this is a first step to avoid always removing it.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nCreate an adhoc metric with custom sql\r\nEdit the datasource and remove or add a column\r\nVerify that the adhoc metric doesn't get removed\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with
