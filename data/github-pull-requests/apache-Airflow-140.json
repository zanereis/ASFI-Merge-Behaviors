#17507 \r\nrelated: #20992\r\n\r\nThis fixes issues in which running a task with impersonation leads to the error `Recorded pid {PID1} does not match the current pid {PID2}`, which then triggers a SIGTERM call to all processes in the group. The issue appears to be that in some cases the recorded pid (which is also the taskinstance pid) is None, which leads the ensuing `psutils.Process(ti.pid).ppid()` call to return the parent of the current running process instead of the parent of the taskinstance - and the parent is the long running Worker, which is not the desired process to identify. \r\n\r\nI was able to reproduce this error regularly and separately traced all processes to try to identify what they were. The \"current pid\" is the task runner, and in most cases the relevant call was so short lived I couldn't even get it in my tracing - which would explain why it was no longer registered to the task instance.

is part of a series of PRs breaking up #22613 into smaller, more reviewable chunks. The end result will be rewriting the existing `airflow` CLI to use Click instead of argparse. For motivation, please see #22708.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the `celery` subcommand to the `airflow-ng` command. It's exactly the same as the `airflow celery` command, it's just implemented with Click. This PR also includes an additional, separate test file for the Click `celery` subcommand. The intent there is to simply remove the test files for the old commands once the Click-based `airflow-ng` command supersedes and replaces the argparse-based `airflow` command.\r\n\r\nFor comparison to the modules this supersedes:\r\n* [`airflow/cli/commands/celery_command.py`](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/cli/commands/celery_command.py)\r\n* [`tests/cli/commands/test_celery_command.py`](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/tests/cli/commands/test_celery_command.py)\r\n\r\nOriginal author: @hankehly

on https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/24403.\r\n\r\n- Adding support for multi select on the log level (via [chakra-react-select](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chakra-react-select))\r\n- Migrating some files to ts\r\n\r\n@bbovenzi , we discussed about removing colors in the drop down. Adding colors inside the logs is not trivial. Even without colors in the logs, I think the left border in the drop down makes it easier to identify the level we are looking for.\r\n\r\nI will happily change the style depending on your feedback.\r\n\r\nEdit: Converting to draft, not ready. I would like to also migrate associated test file to ts in this PR.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14861206/175427946-656ff425-6441-4ce6-be09-b8fefeb71d27.png)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

of bash-based, complex logic script to perform PR selective\r\nchecks we now integrated the whole logic into Breeze Python code.\r\n\r\nIt is now much simplified, when it comes to algorithm. We've\r\nimplemented simple rule-based decision tree. The rules describing\r\nthe decision tree are now are now much easier\r\nto reason about and they correspond one-to-one with the rules\r\nthat are implemented in the code in rather straightforward way.\r\n\r\nThe code is much simpler and diagnostics of the selective checks\r\nhas also been vastly improved:\r\n\r\n* The rule engine displays status of applying each rule and\r\n  explains (with yellow warning message what decision was made\r\n  and why. Informative messages are printed showing the resulting\r\n  output\r\n\r\n* List of files impacting the decision are also displayed\r\n\r\n* The names of \"ci file group\" and \"test type\" were aligned\r\n\r\n* Unit tests covering wide range of cases are added. Each test\r\n  describes what is the case they demonstrate\r\n\r\n* `breeze selective-checks` command that is used in CI can also\r\n  be used locally by just providing commit-ish reference of the\r\n  commit to check. This way you can very easily debug problems and\r\n  fix them\r\n\r\nFixes: #19971\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing! Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests.

is part of a series of PRs breaking up #22613 into smaller, more reviewable chunks. The end result will be rewriting the existing `airflow` CLI to use Click instead of argparse. For motivation, please see #22708.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds `airflow version` subcommand to the `airflow-ng` command. It's exactly the same as the `airflow version` command, it's just implemented with Click. This PR also adds an additional test module for the new command. I opted to copy/add a new test module instead of keeping a single module and making it compatible with both argparse and Click, because that way it will be easier to remove the tests that rely on argparse once all commands are rewritten, the CLI is completely converted to utilize Click, and the `airflow-ng` command replaces the `airflow` command.\r\n\r\n~While this incorporates the changes from #24590, I will rebase this once that PR is merged to make the relevant changes in this PR smaller and easier to separate out and review. Until then, you can use GitHub's [compare view](https://github.com/astronomer/airflow/compare/convert-to-click-cli-pr...astronomer:convert-version-command-to-click) to compare this branch to

is the first PR of what will be a series of PRs breaking up #22613 into smaller, more reviewable chunks. The end result will be rewriting the existing `airflow` CLI to use Click instead of argparse. For motivation, please see #22708.\r\n\r\nThis PR installs Click, adds constraints to Rich_Click so we can rely on some nice features in recent versions of that, adds a new barebones `airflow-ng` console script, and tweaks some CLI internals to be more flexible between argparse and Click.\r\n\r\nTo see how this initial groundwork will be used by future PRs, see #22613, and to see how some of

PR is only a small change in the helm chart of Airflow.\r\n\r\nWhat: Deployments can have security settings in their manifest on two levels: pod and container. However, there are some capabilities only configurable in one of the respective levels(https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.23/#securitycontext-v1-core). This PR sets a default configuration for container securityContext, which denies privilege escalation and drops all POSIX capabilities. These are and should be standard settings in the context of Kubernetes. It also adds the possibility of running Airflow in an Kubernetes environment without PSP (to be removed in v1.25 https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-policy/), but with OpenPolicyAgent (a or possibly the PSP substitute) with the same capabilities as a restricted PSP instead.\r\n\r\nWhy: This missing configuration restricts Airflow from being used with the simple upstream helm chart without modifications/unnecessary maintenance. This especially applies to the restricted policy use in OPA. The specific setting in this PR is **not** inherited from `podSecurityContext`(pod level) in `securityContext`(container level).\r\n\r\nProblem: There is already a `securityContext` in the values.yaml, however, this should also be be called `podSecurityContext` since it's on pod level, but it isn't. To not break backwards compatibility of Airflow, this PR hardcodes the respective capabilities on container level for statsd, scheduler and webserver. \r\n\r\nThe other possibility would be to introduce a `containerSecurityContext` in the values.yaml, which is a made up word since it is commonly called `scurityContext`.\r\n\r\nBenefit in either case would be a more secure deployment.\r\n\r\nIn case of existing issue, reference it using one of the following:\r\n\r\ncloses: #27612\r\n\r\nCould not find any related issue at first sight.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.rst#pull-request-guidelines)** for more information.\r\n\r\nTest was a simple `helm lint .` on chart level as well as a successful deployment.\r\nWARNING: Kubernetes configuration file is group-readable.

the new Breeze, switching to using parallelism is a ... breeze.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the capability of building the images in parallel in Breeze\r\nlocally - for breeze command, but also uses this capability to build the\r\nimages in parallel in our CI. Our builds are always executed on\r\npowerful, big machines with lots of CPU and docker run in memory\r\nfilesystem with 32GB RAM, so it should be possible to run all builds in\r\nparallel on a single machine rather then spin off parallel machines to\r\nrun the builds using the matrix strategy of Github Actions.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking - this will either speed up or get 4x cost saving for\r\nthe build steps for all the \"full test needed\" PRs as well as all the\r\nmain builds.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of savings and improvements we can achieve this way:\r\n\r\n1) less overhead for starting and runnning the machines\r\n2) seems that with the new buildkit, the parallel builds are not\r\n   suffering from some sequential locks (as it used to be, so\r\n   we are basically do the same job using 25% resources for building\r\n   the images.\r\n3) we will stop having random \"one image failed to build\" cases - they\r\n   will all either fail or succeed.\r\n4) Less checks in the output\r\n5) Production builds will additionally gain from single CI image\r\n   pulled in order to perform the preparation of the packages\r\n   and single package preparation step - it will save 4-5 minutes\r\n   per image.\r\n\r\nThe disadvantage is a less clear output of such parallel build where\r\noutputs from multiple builds will be interleaved in one CI output.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

What\r\n\r\n- Add `SqsBatchSensor` which polls SQS multiple times before returning the results\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n![Untitled Diagram drawio](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6369285/174552305-689b5c06-dc8d-4704-85cb-f0e34ad523fe.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Why\r\n\r\n- SQS allows [10 messages per batch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-batch-api-actions.html)\r\n- Current `SqsSensor` perform 1 poll per `poke`, which means effectively `SqsSensor` retrieves 10 messages per execution at max\r\n- In many cases, we may have hundred of messages stuck in the queue and `SqsSensor` dequeues only 10 messages per execution, thus to accelerate a bit, we need to add multiple `SqsSensor` tasks. `SqsSensor` tasks is a type of sensor that runs constantly (every minute for example), and consume worker execution slots.\r\n\r\n- In other cases, we have tasks that should be triggered with arguments retrieved for SQS. Example: the SQS messages contain IDs of items to be processed, and the next task will be triggered with arguments `--id_list=[id1,id2,id3,...]`. Having 10 messages per batch mean the downstream task has to be triggered multiple times, each time with only 10 ids max.\r\n\r\n- Similar to the mechanism provided by [AWS Lambda integration with SQS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-sqs.html), we want to introduce the notion of batch in SQS, just like the way AWS Lambda processes SQS messages.\r\n\r\nContributed thanks to

of 2.3 the `load_default_connections` config was moved from \"core\" to a new \"database\" section. Currently when spinning up Airflow in Breeze a `DeprecationWarning` is displayed for this config:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nStarting Airflow\r\n\r\nDB: postgresql+psycopg2://postgres:***@postgres/airflow\r\n[2022-06-18 03:05:09,528] {db.py:1471} INFO - Creating tables\r\nINFO  [alembic.runtime.migration] Context impl PostgresqlImpl.\r\nINFO

affect the `DeprecationWarning` thrown when using the `breeze start-airflow` command, but for the sake of due diligence, the remaining environment variables of

the images are pushed in CI we are running the verification\r\nof the AMD image now.\r\n\r\nThis cannot be really done during building and pushing the image,\r\nbecause we are using multi-platform images using remote builders\r\nso the image is not even available locally, so we need to actually\r\npull the images after they are built in order to verify them.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds those features:\r\n* ability to pull images for verification with --pull-flag\r\n* ability to verify slim images (regular tests are skipped and\r\n  we only expect the preinstalled providers to be

TimedJSONWebSignatureSerializer has been deprecated from the\r\nitsdangerous library and they recommended to use dedicated\r\nlibraries for it.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/pallets/itsdangerous/issues/129\r\n\r\nSince we are going to move to FAB 4+ with #22397 where newer version of\r\nitsdangerous is used, we need to switch to another library.\r\n\r\nWe are already using PyJWT so the choice is obvious.\r\n\r\nAdditionally to switching, the following improvements were done:\r\n\r\n* the use of JWT claims has been fixed to follow JWT standard.\r\n  We were using \"iat\" header wrongly. The specification of JWT only\r\n  expects the header to be there and be valid UTC timestamp, but the\r\n  claim does not impact maturity of the signature - the signature\r\n  is valid if iat is in the future.\r\n  Instead \"nbf\" - \"not before\" claim should be used to verify if the\r\n  request is not coming from the future. We now require all claims\r\n  to be present in the request.\r\n\r\n* rather than using salt/signing_context we switched to standard\r\n  JWT \"audience\" claim (same end result)\r\n\r\n* we have now much better diagnostics on the server side of the\r\n  reason why request is forbidden - explicit error messages\r\n  are printed in server logs and details of the exception. This\r\n  is secure, we do not spill the information about the reason\r\n  to the client, it's only available in server logs, so there is\r\n  no risk attacker could use it.\r\n\r\n* the JWTSigner is \"use-agnostic\". We should be able to use the\r\n  same class for any other signatures (Internal API from AIP-44)\r\n  with just different audience and algorithm\r\n\r\n* Short, 5 seconds default clock skew is allowed, to account for\r\n  systems that have \"almost\" synchronized time\r\n\r\n* more tests addded with proper time freezing testing both\r\n  expiry and immaturity of the request\r\n\r\nThis change is not a breaking one because the JWT authentication\r\ndetails are not \"public API\" - but in case someone reverse engineered\r\nour claims and implemented their own log file retrieval, we\r\nshould add a change in our changelog - therefore newsfragment\r\nis added.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

PR is a major change to the SFTP provider to remove the dependency on `pysftp` and use `paramiko` via the `SSHHook` instead. The provider was previously inconsistent in its use of `pysftp` vs the `SSHHook`. The `SFTPHook` used `pysftp` to actually create its connection and perform operations, but it inherited from `SSHHook`. The `SFTPOperator` did not use the `SFTPHook` or `pysftp` and instead used the `SSHHook` to create its connection and use the SFTP operations provided by `paramiko`. This PR rewrites the provider so the `SFTPHook` uses the `SSHHook` and `paramiko` (via `SSHHook`) and the `SFTPOperator` uses the `SFTPHook`. This enables support for all of the parameters supported by the `SSHHook` and creates consistency within the SFTP provider. There should be no breaking changes aside from the removal of previously deprecated parameters in the `SFTPHook` since `pysftp` used `paramiko` under the hood anyway.\r\n\r\nA number of changes are contained in this PR:\r\n\r\n- Minor change to the SSH provider to support `ciphers` as an optional extra parameter, which is used by the `SFTPHook`\r\n- Deprecated parameters in the SFTP provider were completely removed since this is a major change to the provider (seemed appropriate, but let me know if that should not have been done yet)\r\n- Any functionality provided by `pysftp` that was used by the `SFTPHook` has been incorporated directly into the provider\r\n- `SFTPHook` supports passing an `SSHHook` to continue supporting that option in the `SFTPOperator`; however, this is marked as deprecated and should be removed in a future major version.  `SFTPOperator` warns users to pass an `SFTPHook` instead now.\r\n- `_make_intermediate_dirs` was removed from `SFTPOperator` since the `create_directory` method on `SFTPHook` supports creating parent directories of subdirectories (functionally equivalent)\r\n- typing was added to `SFTPOperator`\r\n\r\nTests have been written to achieve 100% code coverage and all tests are passing. Previously existing tests were only modified where required to ensure backward compatibility with the provider's original functionality. Please double-check my tests though as I'm not confident in my test writing abilities yet. Docs have been updated as well.\r\n\r\nI will note there was brief discussion with @malthe on Slack to consider using `parallel-ssh` instead but I opted to hold off on that for now. That could be a good future update since some have reported issues with `paramiko` (for example,

fixes #22647, which was marked closed due to lack of activity / feedback.\r\n\r\nSQLAlchemy added [the `cache_ok` flag](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/core/custom_types.html#sqlalchemy.types.TypeDecorator.cache_ok) in 1.4.14. If this is unset in a `TypeDecorator` subclass, it emits a log warning when the class is used. The fix is to set the value to `True` or `False` to suppress the warning.\r\n\r\nI've set the value to `True` for the three `TypeDecorator` classes in the `airflow.utils.sqlalchemy` module, as these classes have no state and are safe to cache. Setting it to `False` would also suppress the warning, and leave behavior unchanged.\r\n","created_at":"2022-06-16T17:15:36Z","updated_at":"2022-07-05T14:16:17Z","closed_at":"2022-07-05T12:50:20Z","merged_at":"2022-07-05T12:50:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"d9694733cafd9a3d637eb37d5154f0e1e92aadd4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2172803017,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcyODAzMDE3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:bug-fix","name":"type:bug-fix","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog:
