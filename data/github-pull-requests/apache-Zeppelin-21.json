What is this PR for?\r\nThis PR enables the interpolation of ZeppelinContext objects into the paragraph text of JDBC cells. It also introduces a new interpreter-level configuration parameter named _zeppelin.jdbc.interpolation_. This new parameter is _false_ by default, and must be set to _true_ to enable object interpolation. The default value of _false_ guarantees backward compatibility for users who are not aware of the new feature.\r\n\r\nThe implementation takes the same approach that was followed in [PR-2898](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2898).\r\n\r\nI have also taken the liberty to correct a preexisting error in the description of the use of Dynamic Forms in the associated documentation (_jdbc.md_).\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Feature]\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [ ] - Task\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-3377\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\nCI Pass. \r\n\r\nThe code in this PR merely causes the JDBC interpreter to \"opt-in\" to the implementation already existing in the `Interpreter` base class - described in [PR-2898](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2898). The unit tests necessary are already present in PR-2898\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update?

What is this PR for?\r\n\r\nZeppelin provides an Alluxio interpreter compiled with Alluxio client v1.0.0, which was released about two years ago. Alluxio 1.0.0 client will not work with Alluxio 1.4 or later. So in order to use Zeppelin with latest Alluxio, we need to increment the version.\r\n\r\nThis JIRA aims to bump the version of Alluxio from 1.0.0 to 1.7.1 (the latest release in March 2018)\r\n\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Improvement]\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n[ZEPPELIN-3373](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-3373)\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\nManual test:\r\n- Build Zeppelin with this patch\r\n- Launch Zeppelin Alluxio interpreter and test the interpreter. \r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n[Screenshot](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12916912/Screen%20Shot%202018-03-27%20at%205.32.36%20PM.png)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? n/a\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? n/a\r\n* Does this needs documentation?

code in this PR enables embedding/interpolating Z variables into command strings passed to Spark's SQL and Shell interpreters. It implements the functionality described in issue [ZEPPELIN-1967](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1967)\r\n\r\n    This PR resumes a fresh effort while taking into consideration all of the discussion in the context of the earlier [PR-2502](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2502). The earlier PR-2502 was closed due to a corruption in my repo that could not be corrected.\r\n\r\n    The code in this PR resolves all of the discussion and suggestions in the body of the earlier [PR-2502](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2502). The following description is a summary of the current implementation:\r\n\r\n    Patterns of the form `{var-name}` within commands will be interpolated only if a predefined object of the specified name exists in `z`. Additionally, all such patterns within the command line should also be translatable for any interpolation to occur. Partial translation of a command line (where only some of the patterns are translated, and others are not) is never performed.\r\n\r\n    Patterns of the form `{{any-text}}` are translated into `{any-text}`. This feature is an escaping mechanism that allows `{` and `}` characters to be passed into a command without invoking the interpolation mechanism.\r\n\r\n    The translations described above are performed only when all occurrences of `{`, `}`, `{{`, and `}}` in any command string conform to one of the two forms described above. A command that contains `{` and/or `}` characters used in any other way (than `{var-name}` and `{{any-text}}` as described above) will be used as-is without attempting any translations whatsoever -- even if the command also contains legal, translate-able and/or escape-able, constructs of the above two forms.\r\n\r\n    No error is flagged in any case. This behavior is identical to the implementation of a similar feature in\r\n    Jupyter's shell invocation using the ! magic command.\r\n\r\n    At present only the SQL and Shell interpreters support object interpolation.\r\n\r\n    [Improvement]\r\n\r\n    * [ ] - Task\r\n\r\n    https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1967\r\n\r\n    A new unit-test class ZeppCtxtVariableTest.java (see below) has been added. The attached screenshots below also show tests of the functionality.\r\n\r\n    ![figure-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/477015/36956999-5f8cca92-2057-11e8-8b76-f4ccd2a21d50.png)\r\n    ![figure-2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/477015/36957001-650f271c-2057-11e8-8e94-4805fd24e796.png)\r\n    ![figure-3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/477015/36957005-6a747dec-2057-11e8-9c72-4ebef17b52db.png)\r\n    ![figure-4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/477015/36957006-6df95ad2-2057-11e8-8585-3eb679e3a146.png)\r\n    ![figure-5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/477015/36957011-7284be02-2057-11e8-9204-3774121397e6.png)\r\n\r\n    * Does the licenses files need update? No\r\n    * Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\r\n    * Does this needs documentation? Yes, and detailed documentation has been added to the part describing ZeppelinContext variables (see file spark.md

What is this PR for?\r\nThis PR enables a generic syntax for inserting credentials. A username can be inserted by $[user.entry] where \"entry\" is the name of the credential. A password can be inserted by $[password.entry].\r\nTo avoid output of the password all occurences of the password-String in the Interpreter-output will be replaced by \"###\". This should not be a really secure feature (since the runner of the notebook knows the password anyway), but it should avoid accidential exposure of the used passwords by any sort of interpreter echo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nFeature\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [ ] - Documentation\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\nZEPPELIN-1070 Enable data source authentication in each community interpreters\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n* unit tests available\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? No\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? The new syntax could break notebooks which contain the patterns $[user.*] or $[password.*]. But I assume this pattern is not very common...\r\n* Does this needs documentation? yes, but I didn't find the proper place to document it

What is this PR for?\r\n\r\nThe code in this PR enables embedding/interpolating Z variables into command strings passed to Spark's SQL and Shell interpreters. It implements the functionality described in issue [ZEPPELIN-1967](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1967)\r\n\r\nThis PR resumes a fresh effort while taking into consideration all of the discussion in the context of the earlier [PR-2502](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2502). The earlier PR-2502 was closed due to a corruption in my repo that could not be corrected.\r\n\r\nThe code in this PR resolves all of the discussion and suggestions in the body of the earlier [PR-2502](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2502). The following description is a summary of the current implementation:\r\n\r\nPatterns of the form `{var-name}` within commands will be interpolated only if a predefined object of the specified name exists in `z`. Additionally, all such patterns within the command line should also be translatable for any interpolation to occur. Partial translation of a command line (where only some of the patterns are translated, and others are not) is never performed.\r\n\r\nPatterns of the form `{{any-text}}` are translated into `{any-text}`. This feature is an escaping mechanism that allows `{` and `}` characters to be passed into a command without invoking the interpolation mechanism.\r\n\r\nThe translations described above are performed only when all occurrences of `{`, `}`, `{{`, and `}}` in any command string conform to one of the two forms described above. A command that contains `{` and/or `}` characters used in any other way (than `{var-name}` and `{{any-text}}` as described above) will be used as-is without attempting any translations whatsoever -- even if the command also contains legal, translate-able and/or escape-able, constructs of the above two forms.\r\n\r\nNo error is flagged in any case. This behavior is identical to the implementation of a similar feature in\r\nJupyter's shell invocation using the ! magic command.\r\n\r\nAt present only the SQL and Shell interpreters support object interpolation.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Improvement]\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [ ] - Task\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1967\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n\r\nA new unit-test class ZeppCtxtVariableTest.java (see below) has been added. The attached screenshots below also show tests of the functionality.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n![figure-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/477015/36956999-5f8cca92-2057-11e8-8b76-f4ccd2a21d50.png)\r\n![figure-2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/477015/36957001-650f271c-2057-11e8-8e94-4805fd24e796.png)\r\n![figure-3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/477015/36957005-6a747dec-2057-11e8-9c72-4ebef17b52db.png)\r\n![figure-4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/477015/36957006-6df95ad2-2057-11e8-8585-3eb679e3a146.png)\r\n![figure-5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/477015/36957011-7284be02-2057-11e8-9204-3774121397e6.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? No\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\r\n* Does this needs documentation? Yes, and detailed documentation has been added to the part describing ZeppelinContext variables (see file spark.md below).\r\n","created_at":"2018-03-05T04:03:16Z","updated_at":"2018-03-28T01:21:15Z","closed_at":"2018-03-28T01:21:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3786898b30be5e795cf846f7f7dc210166cc34ed","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/2834/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/2834/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/2834/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/77738aae27515ba0c6683fcf0c181d5919892926","head":{"label":"sanjaydasgupta:ZEPPELIN-1967","ref":"ZEPPELIN-1967","sha":"77738aae27515ba0c6683fcf0c181d5919892926","user":{"login":"sanjaydasgupta","id":477015,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NzAxNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/477015?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanjaydasgupta","html_url":"https://github.com/sanjaydasgupta","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanjaydasgupta/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanjaydasgupta/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanjaydasgupta/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanjaydasgupta/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanjaydasgupta/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanjaydasgupta/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanjaydasgupta/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanjaydasgupta/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanjaydasgupta/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"5f88452d63f9b6d7ad00328b1c5a0619e47cbc3c","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":32848140,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjg0ODE0MA==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"apache/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin","description":"Web-based

What is this PR for?\r\nThe code in this PR enables embedding/interpolating Z variables into command strings passed to Spark's SQL and Shell interpreters. It implements the functionality described in issue [ZEPPELIN-1967](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1967)\r\n\r\nThis PR resumes a fresh effort while taking into consideration all of the discussion in the context of the earlier [PR-2502](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2502). The earlier PR-2502 was closed due to a corruption in my repo that could not be corrected.\r\n\r\nThe code in this PR resolves all of the discussion and suggestions in the body of the earlier [PR-2502](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2502). The following description is a summary of the current implementation: \r\n\r\nPatterns of the form `{var-name}` within commands will be interpolated only if a predefined object of the specified name exists in `z`. Additionally, **all** such patterns within the command line should also be translatable for any interpolation to occur. Partial translation of a command line (where only some of the patterns are translated, and others are not) is never performed.\r\n\r\nPatterns of the form `{{any-text}}` are translated into `{any-text}`. \r\n\r\nThese translations are performed only when all occurrences of {, }, {{, and }} in any command string confirm to one of the two forms described above. A command containing { and/or } characters used in any other way (than `{var-name}` and `{{any-text}}` described above) is used as-is without any changes. \r\nNo error is flagged in any case. This behavior is identical to the implementation of a similar feature in \r\nJupyter's shell invocation using the ! magic command.\r\n\r\nAt present only the SQL and Shell interpreters support object interpolation. \r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Improvement]\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [ ] - Task\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1967\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\nA new unit-test class ([ZeppCtxtVariableTest.java](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/compare/master...sanjaydasgupta:master#diff-ad942153fbbad8ac1954b1063eabf920)) has been added. The attached screenshots also show tests of the functionality.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n![figure-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/477015/36888230-9104d3c4-1e1a-11e8-9399-f98b1246730b.png)\r\n![figure-2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/477015/36888237-96843bbe-1e1a-11e8-80ac-4bdfe94ead22.png)\r\n![figure-3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/477015/36888240-99fe9c3a-1e1a-11e8-9aa0-9faa32c0fa19.png)\r\n![figure-4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/477015/36888246-9dd86f34-1e1a-11e8-8151-4ece9d8af8e8.png)\r\n![figure-5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/477015/36888251-a1d21644-1e1a-11e8-8431-c5e59773f60c.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? No\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\r\n* Does this needs documentation? Yes, detailed documentation has been added to the part describing ZeppelinContext variables.\r\n","created_at":"2018-03-02T07:38:57Z","updated_at":"2018-03-03T04:22:48Z","closed_at":"2018-03-03T04:22:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3e313cbd058a6a5c64043449970a948bbdefa53f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/2825/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/2825/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/2825/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/a570cf45150303d9effe5a2b2fa09b8611c6312d","head":{"label":"sanjaydasgupta:master","ref":"master","sha":"a570cf45150303d9effe5a2b2fa09b8611c6312d","user":{"login":"sanjaydasgupta","id":477015,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NzAxNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/477015?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanjaydasgupta","html_url":"https://github.com/sanjaydasgupta","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanjaydasgupta/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanjaydasgupta/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanjaydasgupta/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanjaydasgupta/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanjaydasgupta/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanjaydasgupta/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanjaydasgupta/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanjaydasgupta/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanjaydasgupta/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"21dc20d8864915475f58705d8bc2fc8678c22dbe","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":32848140,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjg0ODE0MA==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"apache/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin","description":"Web-based
