When parsing, however, `tvm::tir::ScriptComplete` will wrap the function body in a root block if the primfunc if the contains at least one block and does not already have a root block.  As a result, if the root block is the only block present, it would be stripped by a round-trip.\r\n\r\nThis commit tightens the condition for hiding the root `tir::Block` when converting to TVMScript,

Relay QNN uses its `helper_no_fast_int8_hw_legalization` to convert most `int8` convolution and dense operations into `int16` ones on Arm. This currently occurs on ARM chips except for `v8.2a` chips with `dotprod` support.\r\n\r\nHowever, this behavior means that `int8` operations are replaced with `int16` ones on Cortex-M chips. On these chips `int16` is substantially slower, as while it saves a few sign extension operations, it doubles the amount of memory loads we need to perform. \r\n\r\nThis PR changes when `helper_no_fast_int8_hw_legalization` is used on Arm, and instead makes **not** doing this replacement the standard. We will only do this replacement if we are on a chip with ASIMD support but without `v8.2a` and `dotprod`. This ensures that Cortex-M microcontrollers do not have `int8` operations turned into `int16` ones.\r\n\r\nI have also verified that this does, in fact, improve performance for some common models. For example, MobileNet_v1_0.25 on the Cortex-M4 saw a 10% performance improvement, compared to before this change. Accuracy does not seem to be affected.\r\n\r\ncc @alanmacd @gromero

These are the initial results of that investigation and should serve as a good starting point for others looking to leverage VTCM while running on Hexagon. \r\n\r\n## Results\r\nBelow are the results from running a simple parallel vrmpy operation in several different configurations. Each configuration is described below. \r\n\r\n**Without VTCM:** This is just running the vrmpy operator without loading any data into VTCM \r\n\r\n**Basic VTCM Loads:** This introduces loops to copy the data into VTCM before running the compute without any scheduling of those data copy loops. \r\n\r\n**Vec Loads:** This applies the following scheduling to the data copy loops.  For the DDR -> VTCM loops it uses unroll_split = 8 and vector_split = 64. For VTCM -> DDR loop it uses unroll_split = 8 and vector_split = 8\r\n```\r\nvb, vi = sch.get_loops(block)\r\nv = sch.fuse(vb, vi)\r\n_, vio, vii = sch.split(v, factors=[None, unroll_split, vector_split])\r\nsch.vectorize(vii)\r\nsch.unroll(vio)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Vec + Para Loads:** This applies the same schedule as above except it also parallelizes on an outer loop. The outer_split is always 4. \r\n\r\n```\r\nvb, vi = sch.get_loops(block)\r\nv = sch.fuse(vb, vi)\r\nvbo, vbi, vio, vii = sch.split(v, factors=[outer_split, None, unroll_split, vector_split])\r\nsch.vectorize(vii)\r\nsch.unroll(vio)\r\nsch.parallel(vbo)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Pre + Vec Loads:** Same as \"Vec Loads\" except the VTCM buffers are allocated before runtime and passed into the operator. \r\n\r\n**Pre + Vec + Para Loads:** Same as \"Vec + Para Loads\" except the VTCM buffers are allocated before runtime and passed into the operator. \r\n\r\n**Single DMA Load:** A single DMA command is used to copy all of the data over to VTCM. This was preallocated since I could not get it to work without preallocation. \r\n\r\n**Preloaded:** All of the data is already loaded into VTCM before the test starts. \r\n\r\n### 8Gen1 HDK\r\nTotal Vrmpy Operations | Total Transfer (MB) | Without VTCM (Gops) | Basic VTCM Loads (Gops) | Vec Loads (Gops) | Vec + Para Loads (Gops) | Pre + Vec Loads (Gops) | Pre + Vec + Para Loads (Gops) | Single DMA Load (Gops) | Preloaded (Gops)\r\n-- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | --\r\n1024 | 0.39 | 95.0256 | 0.345 | 0.5408 | 0.5905 | 44.4814 | 32.8886 | 15.0813 | 124.7117\r\n2048 | 0.79 | 124.2389 | 0.4002 | 0.7063 | 0.8826 | 43.5238 | 47.2871 | 16.1339 | 209.2688\r\n4096 | 1.57 | 41.5497 | 0.4215 | 0.8664 | 1.1977 | 10.9374 | 26.5749 | 18.1754 | 241.1628\r\n10240 | 3.93 | 33.2139 | 0.4419 | 1.0506 | 1.7311 | 11.7886 | 34.0405 | 25.4214 | 370.2948\r\n16384 | 6.29 | 20.7683 | 0.4195 | 1.0568 | 1.898 | 7.7292 | 22.5898 | 29.7011 | 397.4137\r\n20480 | 7.86 | 20.2128 | 0.4406 | 1.069 | 1.9779 | 6.6829 | 17.7941 | 25.4929 | 338.294\r\n\r\n\r\n### 888 HDK\r\nTotal Vrmpy Operations | Total Transfer (MB) | Without VTCM (Gops) | Basic VTCM Loads (Gops) | Vec Loads (Gops) | Vec + Para Loads (Gops) | Pre + Vec Loads (Gops) | Pre + Vec + Para Loads (Gops) | Single DMA Load (Gops) | Preloaded (Gops)\r\n-- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | --\r\n1024 | 0.39 | 92.2826 | 0.5363 | 1.1438 | 1.3951 | 42.2813 | 37.2929 | 13.1085 | 121.4004\r\n2048 | 0.79 | 98.8228 | 0.5269 | 1.1818 | 1.6554 | 43.9298 | 43.1773 | 14.5703 | 205.442\r\n4096 | 1.57 | 22.1415 | 0.4095 | 0.988 | 1.5843 | 6.3227 | 16.1113 | 15.397 | 271.1367\r\n10240 | 3.93 | 15.3377 | 0.4323 | 1.1091 | 1.9689 | 6.4958 | 18.68 | 17.9959 | 360.6824\r\n\r\n\r\nBelow are the results from copying data to vtcm with various strategies.

PR adds methods to both get and set late-bound constants.\r\n\r\nThe current approach for saving and restoring a model's late-bound constants is via the either `MoveLateBoundConstantsToFile` and then this file can be reloaded to the Executable by calling `LoadLateBoundConstantsFromFile`. These methods save the constants to a file `consts`.\r\n\r\nI have a need to save and restore the constants in a pre-existing format. In order to write these I added `GetLateBoundConstants`  which returns a Map of all late-bound contants. To restore the constants back to the Executable `LoadLateBoundConstantsFromMap` was added.\r\n\r\nThe PR arranges the code so that both `GetLateBoundConstants` and `LoadLateBoundConstantsFromMap` are used in the existing methods to write and read late-bound constants. This means there is minimal code change, functions were mostly just rearranged to expose the two new entry points.","created_at":"2022-08-31T16:53:24Z","updated_at":"2022-09-01T15:57:50Z","closed_at":"2022-09-01T15:57:41Z","merged_at":"2022-09-01T15:57:41Z","merge_commit_sha":"effcd2251b4bb04e47f8ec288b056b0756ea4f4f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/12664/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/12664/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/12664/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/efed986b4ac903fcc12b5bc9c75cf399fdbf8d60","head":{"label":"rkimball:bob/const-read-write","ref":"bob/const-read-write","sha":"efed986b4ac903fcc12b5bc9c75cf399fdbf8d60","user":{"login":"rkimball","id":15673563,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NjczNTYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15673563?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkimball","html_url":"https://github.com/rkimball","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkimball/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkimball/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkimball/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkimball/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkimball/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkimball/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkimball/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkimball/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkimball/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:main","ref":"main","sha":"0c374544a3e1dc358b23e99eaff719631a9984d7","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":70746484,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3MDc0NjQ4NA==","name":"tvm","full_name":"apache/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm","description":"Open

shared buffer use was entirely disabled for non-flat memory, since the existing checks for shared memory assume flat 1-d spaces.  This was enforced in `FindAlloc` and validated in `PrepareNewAlloc`.  The validation in `PrepareNewAlloc` could trigger, if the buffer sharing was due to an in-place operation, and not through the `FindAlloc` function.\r\n\r\nIn-place operations do not require N-d packing, nor do they introduce ambiguity in how different code generators may interpret non-flat physical indices.  Therefore, this commit relaxes the validation in `PrepareNewAlloc`, allowing buffer reuse of non-flat buffers for in-place operations.\n\ncc @Hzfengsy

Background:\r\nThese tests show one way to attain speedup for hexagon workloads through parallelism. Additionally, they show the speedup attained by various different workloads in the best configuration found (outer loop split into 4). This will hopefully give users an understanding of what to do and what to expect when parallelizing hexagon workloads. \r\n\r\nHere are some tables of the runtimes on various workloads and HDKs. \r\n\r\n#### HVX runtimes on 8gen1 HDK\r\n\r\nOperation | #

buffers with more than one physical axis, the `axis_separators` are required in order to know which groups of logical axes to fuse into each physical axis.  The implementation in `tir.FlattenBuffer` assumed that all buffers were being flattened to a single physical axis.  Because `tir.LowerOpaqueBlock` replaces the `BlockNode::alloc_buffers` with `Allocate` nodes, `tir.FlattenBuffer` no longer has access to the axis separators and performs inconsistent flattening for `Allocate` as opposed to `BufferLoad`/`BufferStore`.  This was introduced in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/12172, which decoupled the lowering/flattening steps.\r\n\r\n~~The commit reorders the `tir.FlattenBuffer` to occur before `tir.LowerOpaqueBlock`, to make use of the axis separators.  Any `Allocate` nodes that exist at that point (e.g. from hand-written schedules) are still flattened to 1-d physical buffers, but the `BlockNode::alloc_buffers` are flattened according to the axis separators.~~ See https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/12652#issuecomment-1233043992.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a `DeclBuffer` node to the output of `tir.LowerOpaqueBlock`, which is then used during `tir.FlattenBuffer` to identify the axis separators.\r\n\r\ncc @Hzfengsy

I actually develop operators for some models, I often need to do some verification.\r\nAnd when I encounter a situation where the input and output values of the entire model do not match the golden values, I often need to dump some intermediate nodes to confirm which node the problem starts from.\r\nAs we know, we can easily print Relay IR by `print(mod[\"main\"])`, \r\n  \r\nRelay IR represents each node as \"%xx %10 %20\", I feel comfortable if we can dump nodes with \"%xx\" as a parameter.  \r\nSo I develop a pass that can dump op by `dump_op_by_num(mod,xx)`.  \r\n\r\nBecause we generally use dump OP for analysis purposes, I set it as an `relay.analysis` API.  \r\nWhat do you think? Do we need such an API?  \r\n\r\nI am looking forward to your reply. Thank you!\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-30T11:47:21Z","updated_at":"2022-09-01T10:32:43Z","closed_at":"2022-09-01T10:32:43Z","merged_at":"2022-09-01T10:32:42Z","merge_commit_sha":"38ba8c0bb69dd76203a96ba6b2a5c067fe0b2ba0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/12646/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/12646/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/12646/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/710ecfa8b6caead711705248fc9ad061fd451fdd","head":{"label":"sisleyli:feat_dump_relay_node","ref":"feat_dump_relay_node","sha":"710ecfa8b6caead711705248fc9ad061fd451fdd","user":{"login":"sisleyli","id":43139237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTM5MjM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43139237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sisleyli","html_url":"https://github.com/sisleyli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sisleyli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sisleyli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sisleyli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sisleyli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sisleyli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sisleyli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sisleyli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sisleyli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sisleyli/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":499843411,"node_id":"R_kgDOHcsBUw","name":"tvm","full_name":"sisleyli/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sisleyli","id":43139237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMTM5MjM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43139237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sisleyli","html_url":"https://github.com/sisleyli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sisleyli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sisleyli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sisleyli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sisleyli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sisleyli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sisleyli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sisleyli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sisleyli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sisleyli/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sisleyli/tvm","description":"Open

up https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/12520 and https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/12626, this PR introduces two database classes:\r\n`UnionDatabase` and `OrderedUnionDatabase`, both of which allow users to\r\norganically compose multiple databases together, so that the high-level\r\nIR (Relay, Relax) could select the best tuning records according to\r\nrunning time or a preferred order given by users.\r\n\r\nTo each query, `UnionDatabase` returns the best record among all the\r\ndatabases given; Instead, `OrderedUnionDatabase` returns he record from\r\nthe first database that responds to the query.\r\n\r\nUsed together, users may specify complicated dispatching patterns like\r\nbelow:\r\n\r\nExamples below demonstrate the usecases of and difference between\r\nUnionDatabase and OrderDatabase.\r\n\r\nAssumption:\r\n* db1, db2 do not have tuning records for the target workload.\r\n* Each of db3, db4, db5 has tuning records r3, r4, r5 for target\r\nworkload respectively.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n#### Case 1. `UnionDatabase`:\r\nmerged_db = ms.database.UnionDatabase(\r\n    db1, # no record\r\n    db2, # no record\r\n    db3, # has r3\r\n    db4  # has r4\r\n)\r\n# returns the better one between r3 and r4\r\nmerged_db.query_tuning_record(..., target_workload)\r\n\r\n### Case 2. `OrderedUnionDatabase`\r\nmerged_db = ms.database.OrderedUnionDatabase(\r\n    db1, # no record\r\n    db2, # no record\r\n    db3, # has r3\r\n    db4  # has r4\r\n)\r\n# returns r3\r\nmerged_db.query_tuning_record(..., target_workload)\r\n\r\n### Case 3. Mix-use scenario\r\nmerged_db = ms.database.UnionDatabase(\r\n    db1, # no record\r\n    db2, # no record\r\n    db3, # has r3\r\n    ms.database.OrderedUnionDatabase( # returns r4\r\n        db4,  # has r4\r\n        db5,  # has r5\r\n    )\r\n)\r\n# returns the better one between r3 and r4\r\nmerged_db.query_tuning_record(..., target_workload)\r\n\r\n### Case 4. Another mix-use scenario\r\nmerged_db = ms.database.UnionDatabase(\r\n    db1, # no record\r\n    db2, # no record\r\n    db3, # has r3\r\n    ms.database.UnionDatabase( # returns the better one between r4 and r5\r\n        db4,  # has r4\r\n        db5,  # has r5\r\n    )\r\n)\r\n# returns the best one among r3, r4 and r5\r\nmerged_db.query_tuning_record(..., target_workload)\r\n\r\n### Case 5. Yet another mix-use scenario\r\nmerged_db = ms.database.OrderedUnionDatabase(\r\n    db1, # no record\r\n    db2, # no record\r\n    ms.database.UnionDatabase( # returns the better one between r3 and r4\r\n        db3, # has r3\r\n        db4, # has r4\r\n    )\r\n    db5,  # has r5\r\n)\r\n# returns the better one between r3 and r4\r\nmerged_db.query_tuning_record(...,

#12520, this PR introduces `ScheduleFnDatabase`, a mocked\r\ndatabase to allow injecting handcrafted schedules provided by a schedule\r\nfunction.\r\n\r\nThe schedule function comes with the following signature:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef schedule_fn(\r\n  sch: tir.Schedule,\r\n) -> bool:\r\n  task_name = sch.mod.attrs[\"task_name\"]\r\n  # ^^^ provides an optional name of the task queried\r\n  ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis mocked database helps incorporate the existing testing utility\r\n`apply_fixed_schedule` more formally into the MetaSchedule-Relay build\r\npipeline, and allows further

PR fixes #11697. The analysis of the bug is elaborated in #12400. The key problem is whether `axis` in `squeeze` means doing nothing or squeezing all one-dimensional axes. \r\n\r\nIn #12400, I provide two possible fixes. I choose to fix TOPI finally. The meaning of `axis` is clearly described here (commit #2020):\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/fb7cf97fbc2cc19a7eea879a3a1598780f6aa6aa/include/tvm/relay/attrs/transform.h#L319-L327\r\nThe later commit to TOPI (#2147), however, does not follow this description. It seems that there is a mistake in this commit and should be corrected. \r\n\r\nCC:

AutoTVM-style, template-based tuning for Hexagon.\r\n\r\nTo run compiled code on Hexagon, we need to use Hexagon `Session` object https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/dc522a6ff65b68532cd1bba43827cd981114df2c/python/tvm/contrib/hexagon/session.py#L35 in the metaschedule `RPCRunner`. But for RPC \"session\", `RPCRunner` expects an instance of `RPCSession`, https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/53fe5966823eee4e011d7228bceab3c82c1d9caa/python/tvm/rpc/client.py#L32,  to be created and used by various customizable functions. \r\n\r\nSince `RPCSession` and Hexagon `Session` have slightly different API, we cannot use `RPCRunner` with customizable functions directly. So I introduced an alternative implementation of `RPCRunner` for Hexagon.\r\n\r\nThe test is disabled for simulator since `HexagonLauncherSimulator` is not pickle-able due to its `multiprocessing.Process` attribute: https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/c97895e0ffb512e73c89de7cdee9846f052244fc/python/tvm/contrib/hexagon/build.py#L614\r\n\r\n\r\nOutput log from tuning `vrmpy`

change made in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/5252 (which added support for Hexagon to the runtime) was increasing the byte alignment from 64 to 128. This can cause problems when interacting with dlpack. For example tests/python/contrib/test_dlpack.py has a high chance of failing when run locally due to torch returning tensors with 64 rather than 128 byte alignment. I'm not sure why it doesnt fail in CI, perhaps the consistency of the environment always returns an appropriately aligned tensor.\r\n\r\nChanging the default alignment allows interoperability with both torch and newer versions of numpy that support dlpack. I've slightly modified the torch test to run multiple times to make sure its behavior is consistent.\r\n\r\nSee previous discussion in #12564. I chatted with @vinx13 and it seems like default 64 byte alignment should be fine for CUDA, so this change wont break anything. I'm reopening this pull request (in a new pr as I did a rebase and it wont let me reopen the previous one). I think this change is still likely positive while we work out a long term target based solution.\n\ncc

better support for 2-tier memory\r\n\r\n- Introduce 'global.ddr' memory scope:\r\n  - Like 'global', this allocates memory from the Hexagon SoC's\r\n    DDR memory.\r\n  - Like 'global.vtcm', the specified tensor shape must be 1d\r\n    or 2d, where 2d indicates Hexagon's \"indirect tensor\"\r\n    (i.e., discontiguous) allocation scheme.\r\n\r\n- Change memory-alignment strategy to always be

there. The change aims to improve customization experience of TIR lowering using annotations.\r\n\r\nCurrently, we have `LowerOpaqueBlock` pass to convert s-tir(schedulable tir with blocks) to non-stir. All annotations are dropped then except those used by legacy TE pragma attributes, they are converted to legacy AttrStmt. For example:\r\n```python\r\n# before\r\nfor i in range(10, annotations={\"pragma_myattr0\": 1, \"my_attr0\": 1}): ....\r\n\r\n# after\r\nwith T.attr(i, \"pragma_myattr0\", 1):\r\n    for i in range(10): ....\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis introduce difficulties when we want to leverage schedule phase annotations in lowering passes.\r\n1. `pragma_` annotations are converted to legacy AttrStmt, which only accepts `PrimExpr` typed value. But the loop/block annotations before are originally much flexible, one could use list/dict to encode more rich compile time hints.\r\n2. Using `AttrStmt` loses the roundtrip property of TIR, thus we fail to write testcases of lowering pass with friendly before/after script comparations.\r\n3. It is more cohesive to encode annotations just with related IR node (like `ForNode`). Or else the developers always have to write separate logics handling attr node and for node.\r\n\r\nThe change just add a pass configuration `\"tir.LowerOpaqueBlock\": {\"preserved_annotations\": List[str]}}`. For each annotation key value of loop or block:\r\n1. if key starts with `pragma_`, keep the original behaviour.\r\n2. if key is registered in `preserved_annotations` list, the annotation is preserved.\r\n3. or else it is dropped.\r\n\r\nThe alternative may be preserve all annotations without any extra configuration. But I think current way take the least impact on overall lowering stream. If we do not add customized pass config into pass context, all things should be same.\r\n\r\n\r\ncc @Hzfengsy

change made in #5252 (which added support for Hexagon to the runtime) was increasing the byte alignment from 64 to 128. This can cause problems when interacting with `dlpack`. For example `tests/python/contrib/test_dlpack.py` has a high chance of failing when run locally due to torch returning tensors with 64 rather than 128 byte alignment. I'm not sure why it doesnt fail in CI, perhaps the consistency of the environment always returns an appropriately aligned tensor.\r\n\r\nChanging the default alignment allows interoperability with both torch and newer versions of numpy that support dlpack. I've slightly modified the torch test to run multiple times to make sure its behavior is consistent.\r\n\r\n@kparzysz-quic do you think there are any drawbacks to decreasing the bit alignment requirement?\r\n\r\n\r\ncc
