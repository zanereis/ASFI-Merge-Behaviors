method wasn't invoked on timeout\n- on_kill() implementation was wrong\n\nNew behavior:\n- Invoke on_kill() when timeout exception is thrown\n- Kill entire process group so no underlying process left

Airflow Maintainers,\n\nPlease accept this PR that addresses the following issues:\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-394\n\nTesting Done:\n- Added a unit test to CoreTests to check if task failures are correctly logged to TaskFail table\n\nThe current task duration chart only reports the task duration times for successful task attempts. If a task is retried multiple times, we don't get a sense of the cumulative duration for that task. With this feature, exposed as a checkbox UI option on the existing Task Duration chart, we can now display the total (a.k.a cumulative) task time for a task

Airflow Maintainers,\n\nPlease accept this PR that addresses the following issues:\n- _(https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-91)_\n\nPer Apache guidelines you need to create a [Jira issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/).\n\nTesting Done:\n- Unittests are required, if you do not include new unit tests please\n  specify why you think this is not required. We like to improve our\n  coverage so a non existing test is even a better reason to include one.\n\nReminders for contributors (REQUIRED!):\n- Your PR's title must reference an issue on \n  [Airflow's JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/). \n  For example, a PR called \"[AIRFLOW-1] My Amazing PR\" would close JIRA \n  issue #1. Please open a new issue if required!\n- Please squash your commits when possible and follow the [How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/). \n  Summarized as follows:\n  1. Separate subject from body with a blank line\n  2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters\n  3. Do not end the subject line with a period\n  4. Use the imperative mood in the subject line (add, not adding)\n  5. Wrap the body at 72 characters\n  6. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how\n","created_at":"2016-08-03T06:40:19Z","updated_at":"2016-10-21T05:29:49Z","closed_at":"2016-10-21T05:29:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"38d27dc0f12f4048fba1027b73f60c8289aea31f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1703/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1703/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1703/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/3f4da343f6bd009acb61d5774e76ff2cb4689249","head":{"label":"zstan:master","ref":"master","sha":"3f4da343f6bd009acb61d5774e76ff2cb4689249","user":{"login":"zstan","id":1107510,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc1MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107510?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zstan","html_url":"https://github.com/zstan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zstan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zstan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zstan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zstan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zstan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zstan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zstan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zstan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zstan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"b39cbdba0bf3c5fd4bdff700266918d756790a84","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":33884891,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzg4NDg5MQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"apache/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow","description":"Apache

Airflow Maintainers,\n\nPlease accept this PR that addresses the following issues:\n-https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-379\n\nTesting Done:\n- Manual testing of sequential imports and exports yielded no errors. Was unable to replicate uploading/downloading a file in the unittest environment.\n\nAdd export option under 'with selected' menu to export selected variables to json.\nAdd upload file option at top of page to import variables from json file.\n\nThe decision was made to avoid flask admin's default export functionality because it\ndoes not handle the possibility of serialized jsons as variable values well.\n\nThe import variables field should be made to look

Airflow Maintainers,\n\nPlease accept this PR that addresses the following issues:\n- _(to be replaced with a link to AIRFLOW-X)_\n#### Testing Done:\n- TBD\n#### Changes\n- Assuming that `DAG_FOLDER` is a git repository, on dag parsing, the created dag objects will have the git revision (sha) of `DAG_FOLDER` as a property\n- Task instances now have the git sha of their parent DAG as a property. \n  - This is first set when the scheduler creates them. \n  - It is stored in the database.\n- An executor and worker that executes a task instance now check a copy of the `DAG_FOLDER` out at the revision of the task instance\n#### TODO:\n- Check that changing the version changes values used in derived files as well (eg .hql)\n- Limit resources consumed by git checkout folders\n- Unit tests\n- Test on real cluster, deploy changes to the dag folder while server and workers are

Airflow Maintainers,\n\nPlease accept this PR that addresses the following issues:\n- [https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-276](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-276)\n#### Changes:\n- Tell gunicorn to prepend `[ready]` to worker process name once worker is ready (to serve requests) - in particular this happens after DAGs folder is parsed\n- Airflow cli runs gunicorn as a child process instead of `excecvp`-ing over itself\n- Airflow cli monitors gunicorn worker processes and restarts them by sending TTIN/TTOU signals to the gunicorn master process\n- Fix bug where `conf.get('webserver', 'workers')` and `conf.get('webserver', 'webserver_worker_timeout')` were ignored\n#### Alternatives\n- Alternatively, https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/1684/files does the same thing but the worker-restart script is provided separately for the user to run\n#### Testing Done:\n- Start airflow, observe that workers are restarted\n- Add new dags to dags folder and check that they show up\n- Run `siege` against airflow while server is restarting and confirm that all requests succeed \n- Run with configuration set to `batch_size = 0`, `batch_size = 1` and `batch_size = 4`\n\n@plypaul @mistercrunch

Airflow Maintainers,\n\nPlease accept this PR that addresses the following issues:\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-341\n\nThis PR adds optional resource requirements for tasks for use with resource managers such as Yarn and Mesos.\n\nConsiderations:\n- I chose to force users to encapsulate resources in a resources object e.g. Resources(cpu=1) instead of just cpu=1 in their dag attributes. This creates the pain of having to import Resources for almost every DAG. I think this is kind of important for scoping/namespacing which we should start doing.\n- Once resources are used by executors we need to add documentation for these new resources (and examples)\n\nTesting Done:\n- New/existing unit tests\n\n@plypaul @artwr @mistercrunch @jlowin @bolkedebruin @criccomini

Airflow Maintainers,\n\nPlease accept this PR that addresses the following issues:\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-69\n\nTesting Done:\n- Updated unittests; backfill examples actually get fired off now (they did not before)\n- Separated off the example_trigger_controller_dag and tested its functionality.\n\nBackfill jobs create taskinstances without any associated\nDagRuns. This creates consistency errors. This patch addresses\nthis issue and also makes the scheduler backfill aware.\n\nIt doesn't deal with the remaining issue that backfills can be\nscheduled on top of existing dag runs and that due to this\nTaskInstances can point to multiple DagRuns \n(this is the case now as well)\n\n@plypaul @jlowin @aoen please give it your thoughts\n","created_at":"2016-07-15T05:43:31Z","updated_at":"2016-08-12T20:41:35Z","closed_at":"2016-08-12T12:49:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e2c1b58f2fd79074f6386c52fe38bda49ac4bd64","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1667/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1667/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1667/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/13c452f1c7b41803c0661ff139a6eb9b9b7b6ad4","head":{"label":"bolkedebruin:backfill_dagrun","ref":"backfill_dagrun","sha":"13c452f1c7b41803c0661ff139a6eb9b9b7b6ad4","user":{"login":"bolkedebruin","id":4282712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4282712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin","html_url":"https://github.com/bolkedebruin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":38505714,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODUwNTcxNA==","name":"airflow","full_name":"bolkedebruin/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bolkedebruin","id":4282712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4282712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin","html_url":"https://github.com/bolkedebruin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bolkedebruin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bolkedebruin/airflow","description":"AirFlow

Airflow Maintainers,\n\nPlease accept this PR that addresses the following issues:\n- _https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-314_\n\nTesting Done:\n- Tested locally on a dag that was previously not working.\n\nBy default, bigquery will only return 50 tables when you ask for a list of all the tables in a datatset.\nIf you are trying to upsert a table that exists, but you have more than 50 tables, the run_table_upsert\nmethod may conclude that the table doesn't exist, and try to insert it, and bigquery will error saying\nthat the table does exist.\n\nThis fix checks if the response has pagination data, and looks at all the pages, rather than just the\nfirst one, to see if the table exists.\n","created_at":"2016-07-05T21:42:46Z","updated_at":"2016-07-06T02:59:34Z","closed_at":"2016-07-05T23:31:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d52347b3412abc4eac0196ae6c83e7ecd68f8c3e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1652/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1652/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1652/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/aaff89c6cd0bc9989cff99d79e23425a1ae381f9","head":{"label":"mtagle:fix_bq_table_upsert","ref":"fix_bq_table_upsert","sha":"aaff89c6cd0bc9989cff99d79e23425a1ae381f9","user":{"login":"mtagle","id":2165162,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNjUxNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2165162?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtagle","html_url":"https://github.com/mtagle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtagle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtagle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtagle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtagle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtagle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtagle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtagle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtagle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtagle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":50198939,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MDE5ODkzOQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"mtagle/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mtagle","id":2165162,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNjUxNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2165162?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtagle","html_url":"https://github.com/mtagle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtagle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtagle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtagle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtagle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtagle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtagle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtagle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtagle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtagle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mtagle/airflow","description":"Airflow

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-302 (improve default commit message)\n\ncc @criccomini (closes your issue AIRFLOW-228)\ncc @bolkedebruin (first shot at closing your issue AIRFLOW-302 \"The Bolke Correction\"):\nPreviously, we always used the PR title as the squash commit subject.\nNow, if the squash contains only one commit, then we use the commit\nmessage for the squash commit message. If the squash contains more than\none commit, we default to the old behavior (using the PR title). We\nstill ask if the user wants to include the PR body, but we only ask if\nthey want to include the individual commits if there was more than one.\n\nI haven't squashed the PR because it contains a large number of small fixes that don't share a common cause.\n","created_at":"2016-07-01T00:35:42Z","updated_at":"2016-08-12T17:37:37Z","closed_at":"2016-07-12T14:55:55Z","merged_at":"2016-07-12T14:55:55Z","merge_commit_sha":"8e0ac53c9cf0426352a020255d6c41522791d4c4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1642/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1642/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1642/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/8e0ac53c9cf0426352a020255d6c41522791d4c4","head":{"label":"jlowin:pr-tool-1","ref":"pr-tool-1","sha":"8e0ac53c9cf0426352a020255d6c41522791d4c4","user":{"login":"jlowin","id":153965,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Mzk2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/153965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin","html_url":"https://github.com/jlowin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":54388220,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NDM4ODIyMA==","name":"airflow","full_name":"jlowin/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jlowin","id":153965,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Mzk2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/153965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin","html_url":"https://github.com/jlowin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jlowin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jlowin/airflow","description":"Airflow

Airflow Maintainers,\n\nPlease accept this PR that addresses the following issues:\n-[AIRFLOW-297](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-297)\n\nTesting Done:\n- Generated DAGs and ran tests locally\n- Testing for this may extend total unit tests time a bit (given delay is exponential). If there are better ways for testing this, please let me know and I can add it as needed.\n\nReminders for contributors (REQUIRED!):\n- Your PR's title must reference an issue on \n  [Airflow's JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/). \n  For example, a PR called \"[AIRFLOW-1] My Amazing PR\" would close JIRA \n  issue #1. Please open a new issue if required!\n- Please squash your commits when possible and follow the [How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/). \n  Summarized as follows:\n  1. Separate subject from body with a blank line\n  2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters\n  3. Do not end the subject line with a period\n  4. Use the imperative mood in the subject line (add, not adding)\n  5. Wrap the body at 72 characters\n  6. Use the body to explain what and why vs.

Airflow Maintainers,\n\nPlease accept this PR that addresses the following issues:\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-289\n\nPer Apache guidelines you need to create a [Jira issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/).\n\nTesting Done:\n- Passes existing tests with minor edits\n\nWhy the change?\n- Currently we cannot run airflow on different systems having conflicting system timezones. Some of the issues with doing that are as follows: \n  - heartbeats appear out of sync to the scheduler (when workers are running on different timezones). With our architecture some of our workers will be running on a timezone different from utc.\n  - if a dag_run is created on a different machine (with a different timezone), the manage_sla function might have unintended behavior as it checks for the time of execution by subtracting the start time of the dag_run from `datetime.now()` - though I am not entirely sure if this is possible - maybe if we have multiple scheduler instances running (on different timezones)?\n  - To make airflow more system independent, given it is a distributed system meant for easy scalability.\n\nPotential Consequences:\n- Might have effects on how we view the data in the UI. \n- Might miss out other areas of the code which rely on system timezone, though its unlikely given the review system in place. Such an issue won't result in any regressions with current systems that are already running on

confirmed the delete menu works on both SQLite and MySQL backend\n\nAIRFLOW-252 fixed the trash button in \"Task Instances\" view on Web UI,\nbut \"With selected\" > \"Delete\" menu does still not working for the same reason.\nThis patch fixes this problem by overriding Flask-Admin's method if the backend is

They share some AWS response checking logic, but it felt like inheriting from a common parent would only reduce that one small bit of duplication while introducing some confusing complexity.\n- Currently for `EmrCreateJobFlowOperator` job_flow_overrides are a python dictionary that allow DAG specific overrides for the EMR connection config (contained in the extra of an Airlfow Connection). However, this python dictionary doesn't allow for templating (for example if you wanted to name your cluster differently for each execution date). Would it make more sense for it to be json overrides, so they could be templated?\n","created_at":"2016-06-27T23:03:20Z","updated_at":"2016-06-30T22:50:53Z","closed_at":"2016-06-30T22:50:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bd71bb78551d1730adbce1695dc9a0cae51be2f2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1630/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1630/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1630/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/ad8e067db754a2aab7eaa360bc8da1763bd51444","head":{"label":"rfroetscher:emr","ref":"emr","sha":"ad8e067db754a2aab7eaa360bc8da1763bd51444","user":{"login":"rfroetscher","id":7364121,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNjQxMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7364121?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfroetscher","html_url":"https://github.com/rfroetscher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfroetscher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfroetscher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfroetscher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfroetscher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfroetscher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfroetscher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfroetscher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfroetscher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfroetscher/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":61072241,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MTA3MjI0MQ==","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"rfroetscher/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rfroetscher","id":7364121,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNjQxMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7364121?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfroetscher","html_url":"https://github.com/rfroetscher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfroetscher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfroetscher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfroetscher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfroetscher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfroetscher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfroetscher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfroetscher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfroetscher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfroetscher/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rfroetscher/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

does not execute multiple commands passed to it in a list, in the singular cursor scope. This has caused SQL statements that depend on the execution of `add jar` and `set` commands to fail as they are being executed in different cursor scopes which are not persistent.\nThe code has been updated to have the cursor object persistent.\n\nTesting Done:\n\nReminders for contributors:\n- Your PR's title must reference an issue on [Airflow's JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/).

Airflow Maintainers,\n\nPlease accept this PR that addresses the following issues:\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-276\n\nParsing and executing dag files can be slow, since they are python scripts. Hence, we cannot reload the dags folder on every request. The current code deals with this by only loading the dags folder once on startup, so it doesn't pick up new changes.\n\nThis PR starts, for each flask (request-serving) worker process, a thread that continuously loads the dags folder. Even if that is slow, the main thread will still serve requests quickly. The threads share a single dagbag object, and once the child thread finishes loading the dags folder, it updates the dagbag object.\n\nThere are a few alternative strategies:\n\nOption 1. We could call `refresh_dags` on every page view. Most of the time the file timestamps will be unchanged and this will be fast. However if an expensive-to-load dag is added, an unlucky user will have to wait a few seconds for his request to be served.\nOption 2. We could make the webserver code not load the dags folder at all, and read exclusively from the airflow db. \n\nConcretely, this option means\n1. A new dag is uploaded to the scheduler's dag folder, or an existing dag is updated\n2. The scheduler loads the new dag\n3. The scheduler partially serialized the new dag and places it in the DB (it cannot be fully serialized since dags are not in general pickleable)\n4. The web UI only renders from the db (it does not need to have the .py file), and so picks up the change\n\nDisadvantages of option 2:\n1. Dags must know how to partially serialize themselves in sufficient detail that the web UI can display all the existing details about them\n2. More data must be put into the db than is currently there\n3. If the scheduler is not up, the UI will not be updated.\n\nOption 3. A separate process (instead of thread) could be started on the web UI, which passes a partially serialized dag to the web process. This also has the disadvantage that dags must know how to partially serialize themselves.\n### Testing Done:\n- [ ] start webserver, add a new dag to `~/airflow/dags`, make sure the new change is visible in the web UI\n- [ ] add a new dag with a syntax error to `~/airflow/dags`, make sure the web UI is still up\n\n@plypaul @mistercrunch

Airflow Maintainers,\n\nPlease accept this PR that addresses the following issues:\n[AIRFLOW-274]: I have updated GoogleCloudStorageDownloadOperator so that it has the option to store the downloaded file's contents in an XCom instead of saving to disk. It now also takes filename as an optional argument instead of a required argument, so it is not necessary to save to disk if you do not need to. \n\nTesting Done: I ran a DAG that relies on this functionality and it ran correctly.\n","created_at":"2016-06-23T01:27:01Z","updated_at":"2016-06-27T16:50:23Z","closed_at":"2016-06-24T03:30:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"681512d50f6394023ad565d460198b0896f8ab7e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1618/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/1618/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/1618/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/be119378c9105731a10cb72e0c7b3b61b82ea366","head":{"label":"illop:risk_analytics","ref":"risk_analytics","sha":"be119378c9105731a10cb72e0c7b3b61b82ea366","user":{"login":"illop","id":19943227,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5OTQzMjI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19943227?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/illop","html_url":"https://github.com/illop","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/illop/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/illop/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/illop/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/illop/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/illop/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/illop/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/illop/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/illop/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/illop/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":61762532,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MTc2MjUzMg==","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"illop/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"illop","id":19943227,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5OTQzMjI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19943227?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/illop","html_url":"https://github.com/illop","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/illop/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/illop/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/illop/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/illop/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/illop/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/illop/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/illop/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/illop/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/illop/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/illop/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache
