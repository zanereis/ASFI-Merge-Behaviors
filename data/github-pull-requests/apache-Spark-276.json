In that solution there is a step that wraps the input stream with compression and/or encryption. This step is prone to exceptions, but in the current code there is no exception handling for this step and this has caused confusion for the user. The  confusion was that after SPARK-4105 the user expects to see either a fetchFailed exception or a warning about a corrupted block. However an exception during wrapping can fail the job without any of those.  This change adds exception handling for the wrapping step and also adds a fetch retry if we experience a corruption during the wrapping step. The reason for adding the retry is that usually user won't experience the same failure after rerunning the job and so it seems reasonable try to fetch and wrap one more time instead of

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr removed the method `updateBytesReadWithFileSize` in `FileScanRDD` because it computes input metrics by file size supported in Hadoop 2.5 and earlier. The current Spark does not support the versions, so it causes wrong input metric numbers.\r\n\r\nThis is rework from #22232.\r\n\r\nCloses #22232\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded tests in `FileBasedDataSourceSuite`.","created_at":"2018-09-04T02:05:20Z","updated_at":"2019-12-26T08:04:22Z","closed_at":"2018-09-07T04:47:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a0112e4263a13535e063c360677f467fe1202032","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22324/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22324/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22324/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/bc05a354e375dfb1df6a70a46f28b792f8567fc5","head":{"label":"maropu:pr22232-2","ref":"pr22232-2","sha":"bc05a354e375dfb1df6a70a46f28b792f8567fc5","user":{"login":"maropu","id":692303,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MjMwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/692303?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu","html_url":"https://github.com/maropu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":27115199,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzExNTE5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"maropu/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"maropu","id":692303,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MjMwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/692303?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu","html_url":"https://github.com/maropu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maropu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/maropu/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe default behaviour of Spark on K8S currently is to create `emptyDir` volumes to back `SPARK_LOCAL_DIRS`.  In some environments e.g. diskless compute nodes this may actually hurt performance because these are backed by the Kubelet's node storage which on a diskless node will typically be some remote network storage.\r\n\r\nEven if this is enterprise grade storage connected via a high speed interconnect the way Spark uses these directories as scratch space (lots of relatively small short lived files) has been observed to cause serious performance degradation.  Therefore we would like to provide the option to use K8S's ability to instead back these `emptyDir` volumes with `tmpfs`. Therefore this PR adds a configuration option that enables `SPARK_LOCAL_DIRS` to be backed by Memory backed `emptyDir` volumes rather than the default.\r\n\r\nDocumentation is added to describe both the default behaviour plus this new option and its implications.  One of which is that scratch space then counts towards your pods memory limits and therefore users will need to adjust their memory requests accordingly.\r\n\r\n*NB* - This is an alternative version of PR #22256 reduced to just the `tmpfs` piece\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nRan with this option in our diskless compute environments to verify functionality","created_at":"2018-09-03T09:07:39Z","updated_at":"2018-10-31T11:17:16Z","closed_at":"2018-09-06T23:22:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a99268e731d9ba154a7c4436603147ca77c75fbe","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22323/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22323/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22323/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8bc9f0e750fd1418eb8f14310e519daec663f713","head":{"label":"rvesse:SPARK-25262-tmpfs","ref":"SPARK-25262-tmpfs","sha":"8bc9f0e750fd1418eb8f14310e519daec663f713","user":{"login":"rvesse","id":2104864,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDQ4NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2104864?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvesse","html_url":"https://github.com/rvesse","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvesse/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvesse/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvesse/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvesse/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvesse/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvesse/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvesse/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvesse/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvesse/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":29888493,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTg4ODQ5Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"rvesse/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rvesse","id":2104864,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDQ4NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2104864?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvesse","html_url":"https://github.com/rvesse","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvesse/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvesse/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvesse/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvesse/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvesse/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvesse/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvesse/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvesse/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvesse/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rvesse/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nLet's see the follow example:\r\n```\r\n        val location = \"/tmp/t\"\r\n        val df = spark.range(10).toDF(\"id\")\r\n        df.write.format(\"parquet\").saveAsTable(\"tbl\")\r\n        spark.sql(\"CREATE VIEW view1 AS SELECT id FROM tbl\")\r\n        spark.sql(s\"CREATE TABLE tbl2(ID long) USING parquet location $location\")\r\n        spark.sql(\"INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE tbl2 SELECT ID FROM view1\")\r\n        println(spark.read.parquet(location).schema)\r\n        spark.table(\"tbl2\").show()\r\n```\r\nThe output column name in schema will be `id` instead of `ID`, thus the last query shows nothing from `tbl2`. \r\nBy enabling the debug message we can see that the output naming is changed from `ID` to `id`, and then the `outputColumns` in `InsertIntoHadoopFsRelationCommand` is changed in `RemoveRedundantAliases`.\r\n![wechatimg5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1097932/44947871-6299f200-ae46-11e8-9c96-d45fe368206c.jpeg)\r\n\r\n![wechatimg4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1097932/44947866-56ae3000-ae46-11e8-8923-8b3bbe060075.jpeg)\r\n\r\n**To guarantee correctness**, we should change the output columns from `Seq[Attribute]` to `Seq[String]` to avoid its names being replaced by optimizer.\r\n\r\nI will fix project elimination related rules in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/22311 after this one.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit test.\r\n","created_at":"2018-09-03T07:18:24Z","updated_at":"2024-10-24T07:33:35Z","closed_at":"2018-09-06T02:42:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f4b004cd90202da850bf5593189df9e53be197d9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22320/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22320/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22320/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4590c9837026e820d7d91300a7ab3f87a668755c","head":{"label":"gengliangwang:fixOutputSchema","ref":"fixOutputSchema","sha":"4590c9837026e820d7d91300a7ab3f87a668755c","user":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":95047635,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NTA0NzYzNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"gengliangwang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nResolveReferences rule modifies (deduplicates) conflicting AttributeReferences in left and right side of a Join. It changes the right side to avoid conflicts but it forgot to change the references in the condition of the join. Solution is to rewrite the condition too.\r\n\r\nDetails:\r\n\r\nWith this PR, if any of the resolved attributes in a join condition refer to an attribute that is replaced during the deduplication (`dedupRight()`) then the join condition is modified to reflect the change.\r\nThe modification is done regardless whether the reference is on the left or the right side of the condition.\r\n\r\nThis PR has no effect on unresolved attributes. Those attributes are resolved later by different rules. \r\n\r\nThis PR helps in those cases where same origin dataframes (`b`, `c`) are joined to a different origin one (`a`): \r\n```\r\nval a = spark.range(1, 5)\r\nval b = spark.range(10)\r\nval c = b.filter($\"id\" % 2 === 0)\r\nval r = a.join(b, a(\"id\") === b(\"id\"), \"inner\").join(c, a(\"id\") === c(\"id\"), \"inner\")\r\n```\r\nHere the result of `a join b` contains an `id` attribute coming from `b`. That attribute conflicts with the `id` attribute of `c` in the second join so `c(\"id\")` is deduplicated to let's say `X` and the join condition `a(\"id\") === c(\"id\")` needs to be modified to `a(\"id\") === X` to get correct results.\r\n\r\nI believe it is also worth explaining some situations where this PR does't help (but also does no harm). In cases where same origin dataframes are joined to each other:\r\n```\r\nval b = spark.range(10)\r\nval c = b.filter($\"id\" % 2 === 0)\r\nval r = b.join(c, b(\"id\") === c(\"id\"), \"inner\")\r\n```\r\nIn this latter case the deduplication is applied as both `b` and `c` have an `id` attribute (that actually refer to the same resolved attribute (have the same `ExprId`)). Deduplication results `c(\"id\")` to be changed to let's say `X`. So in this case both `b(\"id\")` and `c(\"id\")` in the join condition are modified to `X` by the changes introduced in this PR. The reason why the result will be correct with this PR (and is correct without this PR) is that the current implementation of Spark contains a \"hack\" in `Dataframe` that fixes `EqualTo` and `EqualNullSafe` type of conditions with identical references on both sides. The hack rewrites these join conditions by re-resolving the attributes with the name of the attribute on both the left and right sides.\r\n\r\nPlease note that until a resolved attribute doesn't contain some kind of reference to it's dataframe not all  cases of join can be handled properly. Such an initiative can be found in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/21449.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded unit test.\r\n\r\nPlease review

request.\r\n","created_at":"2018-09-03T02:06:47Z","updated_at":"2020-01-08T00:07:26Z","closed_at":"2020-01-08T00:07:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e7a89058db73deb555452809dffc957090c9c97e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22318/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22318/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22318/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/938bd7ffab2796a298548f8e9a1a8d2b3f1aa901","head":{"label":"peter-toth:SPARK-25150","ref":"SPARK-25150","sha":"938bd7ffab2796a298548f8e9a1a8d2b3f1aa901","user":{"login":"peter-toth","id":7253827,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNTM4Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7253827?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth","html_url":"https://github.com/peter-toth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":130546049,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzA1NDYwNDk=","name":"spark","full_name":"peter-toth/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"peter-toth","id":7253827,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNTM4Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7253827?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth","html_url":"https://github.com/peter-toth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/peter-toth/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn both ORC data sources, `createFilter` function has exponential time complexity due to its skewed filter tree generation. This PR aims to improve it by using new `buildTree` function.\r\n\r\n**REPRODUCE**\r\n```scala\r\n// Create and read 1 row table with 1000 columns\r\nsql(\"set spark.sql.orc.filterPushdown=true\")\r\nval selectExpr = (1 to 1000).map(i => s\"id c$i\")\r\nspark.range(1).selectExpr(selectExpr: _*).write.mode(\"overwrite\").orc(\"/tmp/orc\")\r\nprint(s\"With 0 filters, \")\r\nspark.time(spark.read.orc(\"/tmp/orc\").count)\r\n\r\n// Increase the number of filters\r\n(20 to 30).foreach { width =>\r\n  val whereExpr = (1 to width).map(i => s\"c$i is not null\").mkString(\" and \")\r\n  print(s\"With $width filters, \")\r\n  spark.time(spark.read.orc(\"/tmp/orc\").where(whereExpr).count)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**RESULT**\r\n```scala\r\nWith 0 filters, Time taken: 653 ms                                              \r\nWith 20 filters, Time taken: 962 ms\r\nWith 21 filters, Time taken: 1282 ms\r\nWith 22 filters, Time taken: 1982 ms\r\nWith 23 filters, Time taken: 3855 ms\r\nWith 24 filters, Time taken: 6719 ms\r\nWith 25 filters, Time taken: 12669 ms\r\nWith 26 filters, Time taken: 25032 ms\r\nWith 27 filters, Time taken: 49585 ms\r\nWith 28 filters, Time taken: 98980 ms    // over 1 min 38 seconds\r\nWith 29 filters, Time taken: 198368 ms   // over 3 mins\r\nWith 30 filters, Time taken: 393744 ms   // over 6 mins\r\n```\r\n\r\n**AFTER THIS PR**\r\n```scala\r\nWith 0 filters, Time taken: 774 ms\r\nWith 20 filters, Time taken: 601 ms\r\nWith 21 filters, Time taken: 399 ms\r\nWith 22 filters, Time taken: 679 ms\r\nWith 23 filters,

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently in optimizer rule `CollapseProject`, the lower level project is collapsed into upper level, but the naming of alias in lower level is propagated in upper level.\r\nIn `ColumnPruning`,  `Project` is eliminated if its child's output attributes is `semanticEquals` to it, even the naming doesn't match.\r\n\r\nLet's see the follow example:\r\n```\r\n        val location = \"/tmp/t\"\r\n        val df = spark.range(10).toDF(\"id\")\r\n        df.write.format(\"parquet\").saveAsTable(\"tbl\")\r\n        spark.sql(\"CREATE VIEW view1 AS SELECT id FROM tbl\")\r\n        spark.sql(s\"CREATE TABLE tbl2(ID long) USING parquet location $location\")\r\n        spark.sql(\"INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE tbl2 SELECT ID FROM view1\")\r\n        println(spark.read.parquet(location).schema)\r\n        spark.table(\"tbl2\").show()\r\n```\r\nThe output column name in schema will be `id` instead of `ID`, thus the last query shows nothing from `tbl2`. \r\nBy enabling the debug message we can see that the output naming is changed from `ID` to `id`, and then the `outputColumns` in `InsertIntoHadoopFsRelationCommand` is changed in `RemoveRedundantAliases`.\r\n![wechatimg5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1097932/44947871-6299f200-ae46-11e8-9c96-d45fe368206c.jpeg)\r\n\r\n![wechatimg4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1097932/44947866-56ae3000-ae46-11e8-8923-8b3bbe060075.jpeg)\r\n\r\nWith the fix proposed in this PR, the output naming `ID` won't be changed.\r\n![wechatimg3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1097932/44947923-1c915e00-ae47-11e8-9a04-0d60b65dd1f1.jpeg)\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR adds support for [Scala value class][1] in schema of Datasets (as both top level class and nested field). \r\nThe idea is to treat  value class as its underlying type at run time. For example:\r\n```scala\r\ncase class Id(get: Int) extends AnyVal\r\ncase class User(id: Id) // field `id` will be treated as Int\r\n```\r\nHowever, if the value class is top-level (e.g. `Dataset[Id]`) then it must be treated like a boxed type and must be instantiated. I'm not sure why it behaves this way but I suspect it is related to the [expansion of value class][2] when we do casting (e.g. `asInstanceOf[T]`)\r\n\r\nActually, this feature is addressed before in [SPARK-17368][3] but the patch only supports top-level case. Hence we see the error when value class is nested as in [SPARK-19741][4] and [SPARK-20384][5]\r\n\r\n[1]: https://docs.scala-lang.org/sips/value-classes.html\r\n[2]:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhen a hive view uses an UDF from a non default database, Spark analyser throws AnalysisException\r\n\r\nSteps to simulate this issue\r\n-----------------------------\r\nStep 1: Run following statements in Hive\r\n--------\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE emp AS SELECT 'user' AS name, 'address' as address;\r\nCREATE DATABASE d100;\r\nCREATE FUNCTION d100.udf100 as 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.udf.generic.GenericUDFUpper'; // Note: udf100 is created in d100\r\nCREATE VIEW d100.v100 AS SELECT d100.udf100(name) FROM default.emp; \r\nSELECT * FROM d100.v100; // query on view d100.v100 gives correct result\r\n```\r\nStep2 : Run following statement in Spark-shell \r\n-------------\r\n```scala\r\nspark.sql(\"SELECT * FROM d100.v100\").show\r\n```\r\nthrows \r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: Undefined function: 'd100.udf100'. This function is neither a registered temporary function nor a permanent function registered in the database 'default'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is because, while parsing the SQL statement of the View \r\n``` 'select `d100.udf100`(`emp`.`name`) from `default`.`emp`' ``` , spark parser fails to split database name and udf name and hence Spark function registry tries to load the UDF 'd100.udf100' from 'default' database.\r\n\r\nTo solve this issue, before creating 'FunctionIdentifier' ,  try to  get  actual database name and then create FunctionIdentifier using  that database name and function name \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded 1 unit test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR implements a new feature - window aggregation Pandas UDF for bounded window.\r\n\r\n#### Doc:\r\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/14EjeY5z4-NC27-SmIP9CsMPCANeTcvxN44a7SIJtZPc/edit#heading=h.c87w44wcj3wj\r\n\r\n#### Example:\r\n```\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import pandas_udf, PandasUDFType\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.window import Window\r\n\r\ndf = spark.range(0, 10, 2).toDF('v')\r\nw1 = Window.partitionBy().orderBy('v').rangeBetween(-2, 4)\r\nw2 = Window.partitionBy().orderBy('v').rowsBetween(-2, 2)\r\n\r\n@pandas_udf('double', PandasUDFType.GROUPED_AGG)\r\ndef avg(v):\r\n    return v.mean()\r\n\r\ndf.withColumn('v_mean', avg(df['v']).over(w1)).show()\r\n# +---+------+\r\n# |  v|v_mean|\r\n# +---+------+\r\n# |  0|   1.0|\r\n# |  2|   2.0|\r\n# |  4|   4.0|\r\n# |  6|   6.0|\r\n# |  8|   7.0|\r\n#

5.0|\r\n# |  8|   6.0|\r\n# +---+------+\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### High level changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR modifies the existing WindowInPandasExec physical node to deal with unbounded (growing, shrinking and sliding) windows.\r\n\r\n* `WindowInPandasExec` now share the same base class as `WindowExec` and share utility functions. See `WindowExecBase`\r\n* `WindowFunctionFrame` now has two new functions `currentLowerBound` and `currentUpperBound` - to return the lower and upper window bound for the current output row. It is also modified to allow `AggregateProcessor` == null. Null aggregator processor is used for `WindowInPandasExec` where we don't have an aggregator and only uses lower and upper bound functions from `WindowFunctionFrame`\r\n* The biggest change is in `WindowInPandasExec`, where it is modified to take `currentLowerBound` and `currentUpperBound` and write those values together with the input data to the python process for rolling window aggregation. See `WindowInPandasExec` for more details.\r\n\r\n#### Discussion\r\nIn benchmarking, I found numpy variant of the rolling window UDF is much faster than the pandas version:\r\n\r\nSpark SQL window function: 20s\r\nPandas variant: ~80s\r\nNumpy variant: 10s\r\nNumpy variant with numba: 4s\r\n\r\nAllowing numpy variant of the vectorized UDFs is something I want to discuss because of the performance improvement, but doesn't have to be in this PR.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew tests\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-31T15:23:21Z","updated_at":"2020-01-08T03:53:18Z","closed_at":"2018-12-18T01:19:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9dd1f95879760b699021e10bd17819297721adf6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22305/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22305/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22305/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/03702d450a0a9da7bb50057b3bab35bdec7d4584","head":{"label":"icexelloss:SPARK-24561-bounded-window-udf","ref":"SPARK-24561-bounded-window-udf","sha":"03702d450a0a9da7bb50057b3bab35bdec7d4584","user":{"login":"icexelloss","id":793516,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MzUxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/793516?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icexelloss","html_url":"https://github.com/icexelloss","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icexelloss/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icexelloss/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icexelloss/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icexelloss/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icexelloss/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icexelloss/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icexelloss/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icexelloss/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icexelloss/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":87476665,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4NzQ3NjY2NQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"icexelloss/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"icexelloss","id":793516,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MzUxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/793516?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/icexelloss","html_url":"https://github.com/icexelloss","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icexelloss/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icexelloss/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icexelloss/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icexelloss/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icexelloss/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icexelloss/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icexelloss/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icexelloss/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/icexelloss/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/icexelloss/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nBefore Apache Spark 2.3, table properties were ignored when writing data to a hive table(created with STORED AS PARQUET/ORC syntax), because the compression configurations were not passed to the FileFormatWriter in hadoopConf. Then it was fixed in #20087. But actually for CTAS with USING PARQUET/ORC syntax, table properties were ignored too when convertMastore, so the test case for CTAS not supported. \r\n\r\nNow it has been fixed  in #20522 , the test case should be enabled too.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nThis only re-enables the test cases of previous

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd an up-front check that `JIRA_USERNAME` and `JIRA_PASSWORD` have been set. If they haven't, ask user if they want to continue. This prevents the JIRA state update from failing at the very end of the process because user forgot to set these environment variables.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI ran the script with environment vars set, and unset, to verify it works as specified.\r\n\r\nPlease review http://spark.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe motivation for these additional metrics is to help in troubleshooting and monitoring task execution workload when running on a cluster. Currently available metrics include executor threadpool metrics for task completed and for active tasks. The addition of threadpool taskStarted metric will allow for example to collect info on the (approximate) number of failed tasks by computing the difference thread started – (active threads + completed tasks and/or successfully finished tasks).\r\nThe proposed metric finishedTasks is also intended for this type of troubleshooting. The difference between finshedTasks and threadpool.completeTasks, is that the latter is a (dropwizard library) gauge taken from the threadpool, while the former is a (dropwizard) counter computed in the [[Executor]] class, when a task successfully finishes, together with several other task metrics counters.\r\nNote, there are similarities with some of the metrics introduced in SPARK-24398, however there are key differences, coming from the fact that this PR concerns the executor source, therefore providing metric values per executor + metric values do not require to pass through the listerner bus in this case.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested on a YARN cluster","created_at":"2018-08-30T19:46:59Z","updated_at":"2019-07-26T21:08:30Z","closed_at":"2019-07-26T21:08:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"972544ed8eed442fed986324a21292a1e032cd19","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen submitting applications to Yarn in cluster mode, using the InProcessLauncher, spark finds the cluster's configuration files based on the HADOOP_CONF_DIR/YARN_CONF_DIR environment variables. This does not make it possible to submit to more than one Yarn clusters concurrently using the InProcessLauncher. \r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new property `spark.hadoop.conf.dir` that lets users select the location of the config files for each submission separately.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nIntegration test\r\n\r\ncc @vanzin @jerryshao

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nEvery time a task is unschedulable because of the condition where no. of task failures < no. of executors available, we currently abort the taskSet - failing the job. This change tries to acquire new executors so that we can complete the job successfully. We try to acquire a new executor only when we can kill an existing idle executor. We fallback to the older implementation where we abort the job if we cannot find an idle executor. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI performed some manual tests to check and validate the behavior. \r\n\r\n```scala\r\nval rdd = sc.parallelize(Seq(1 to 10), 3)\r\n\r\nimport org.apache.spark.TaskContext\r\n\r\nval mapped = rdd.mapPartitionsWithIndex ( (index, iterator) => { if (index == 2) { Thread.sleep(30 * 1000); val attemptNum = TaskContext.get.attemptNumber; if (attemptNum < 3) throw new Exception(\"Fail for blacklisting\")};  iterator.toList.map (x => x + \" -> \" + index).iterator } )\r\n\r\nmapped.collect\r\n```","created_at":"2018-08-30T18:23:59Z","updated_at":"2018-11-06T15:54:13Z","closed_at":"2018-11-06T14:31:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9efcc26248678b21b1cf86289ef15139f8812574","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22288/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22288/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22288/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a30276f3780476ac39de766deef914de8b7b7e0a","head":{"label":"dhruve:bug/SPARK-22148","ref":"bug/SPARK-22148","sha":"a30276f3780476ac39de766deef914de8b7b7e0a","user":{"login":"dhruve","id":7732317,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MzIzMTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7732317?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve","html_url":"https://github.com/dhruve","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":54914940,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NDkxNDk0MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"dhruve/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dhruve","id":7732317,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MzIzMTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7732317?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve","html_url":"https://github.com/dhruve","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dhruve/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the Planner, we collect the placeholder which need to be substituted in the query execution plan and once we plan them, we substitute the placeholder with the effective plan.\r\n\r\nIn this second phase, we rely on the `==` comparison, ie. the `equals` method. This means that if two placeholder plans - which are different instances - have the same attributes (so that they are equal, according to the equal method) they are both substituted with their corresponding new physical plans. So, in such a situation, the first time we substitute both them with the first of the 2 new generated plan and the second time we substitute nothing.\r\n\r\nThis is usually of no harm for the execution of the query itself, as the 2 plans are identical. But since they are the same instance, now, the local variables are shared (which is unexpected). This causes issues for the metrics collected, as the same node is executed 2 times, so the metrics are accumulated 2 times, wrongly.\r\n\r\nThe PR proposes to use the `eq` method in checking which placeholder needs to be substituted,; thus in the previous situation, actually both the two different physical nodes which are created (one for each time the logical plan appears in the query plan) are used and the metrics are collected properly for each of them.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nadded

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe commit https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/131ca146ed390cd0109cd6e8c95b61e418507080 replaced Scala parallel collections in `UnionRDD` by `parmap`. The changes cause a deadlock in the `partitions` method if the method is called recursively and number of unions of the top level union is bigger than maximum size of the thread pool used in `UnionRDD`. In the PR, I propose to revert Scala parallel collections back since they support nested calls even on fixed thread pools.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI added a test which creates 2 levels of unionRDDs wider than fixed thread pool.\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-30T12:34:50Z","updated_at":"2019-08-17T13:33:25Z","closed_at":"2018-08-31T21:35:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bab031aea695fec2b6b00c4aaad263ae428fb408","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22283/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22283/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22283/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1df1a424766dd7c8fd12dee5d2a34620e0025326","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:deadlock-unionrdd","ref":"deadlock-unionrdd","sha":"1df1a424766dd7c8fd12dee5d2a34620e0025326","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR targets for DataSource V2 to have `USING` syntax support mainly. \r\n\r\nCurrently, \r\n\r\n```scala\r\nspark.sql(s\"CREATE TABLE tableB USING ${classOf[SimpleDataSourceV2].getCanonicalName}\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nproduces an error:\r\n\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.sources.v2.SimpleDataSourceV2 is not a valid Spark SQL Data Source.;\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: org.apache.spark.sql.sources.v2.SimpleDataSourceV2 is not a valid Spark SQL Data Source.;\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.DataSource.resolveRelation(DataSource.scala:385)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.command.CreateDataSourceTableCommand.run(createDataSourceTables.scala:78)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.command.ExecutedCommandExec.sideEffectResult$lzycompute(commands.scala:70)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.command.ExecutedCommandExec.sideEffectResult(commands.scala:68)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.command.ExecutedCommandExec.executeCollect(commands.scala:79)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo that developers (Datasource V1) can easily migrate and their users can smoothly change their codes using `USING` syntax from Datasource v1, we better support this case as well.\r\n\r\nThere's a discussion thread about this here as well - http://apache-spark-developers-list.1001551.n3.nabble.com/DISCUSS-USING-syntax-for-Datasource-V2-td24754.html\r\n\r\nFor this one, looks we can proceed orthogonally with multiple catalog support.\r\n\r\nThe approach taken here is basically introduce `DataSourceRelation` trait which connects DataSourceV1 and DataSourceV2 so that the changes can be minimised. For extendability, this uses a pattern match so that, for instance, newer DataSource can be added in the (far) future.\r\n\r\nFor `StreamingDataSourceV2Relation` and `BatchWriteSupportProvider`, it is not handled here.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests were

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nYARN applicationMaster metrics registration introduced in SPARK-24594 causes further registration of static metrics (Codegenerator and HiveExternalCatalog) and of JVM metrics, which I believe do not belong in this context.\r\nThis looks like an unintended side effect of using the start method of [[MetricsSystem]].\r\nA possible solution proposed here, is to introduce startNoRegisterSources to avoid these additional registrations of static sources and of JVM sources in the case of YARN applicationMaster metrics (this could be useful for other metrics that may be added in the future).\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested on a YARN cluster,\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-30T07:27:19Z","updated_at":"2019-09-16T06:54:26Z","closed_at":"2018-12-13T00:21:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e059e11909871a4dae436c900b9c262b2c678045","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22279/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22279/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22279/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9c21f161979ecfa8d3012d9fe45f4ee35f572648","head":{"label":"LucaCanali:YarnMetricsRemoveExtraSourceRegistration","ref":"YarnMetricsRemoveExtraSourceRegistration","sha":"9c21f161979ecfa8d3012d9fe45f4ee35f572648","user":{"login":"LucaCanali","id":5243162,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDMxNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243162?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali","html_url":"https://github.com/LucaCanali","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":145986175,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDU5ODYxNzU=","name":"spark","full_name":"LucaCanali/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"LucaCanali","id":5243162,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDMxNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243162?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali","html_url":"https://github.com/LucaCanali","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/LucaCanali/spark","description":"Mirror

The issue seems to be with the redundant constrains, Below is a test which explains it. \r\n\r\n  test(\"redundant constrains\") {\r\n    val tr = LocalRelation('a.int, 'b.string, 'c.int)\r\n    val aliasedRelation = tr.where('a.attr > 10).select('a.as('x), 'b, 'b.as('y), 'a.as('z))\r\n\r\n    verifyConstraints(aliasedRelation.analyze.constraints,\r\n      ExpressionSet(Seq(resolveColumn(aliasedRelation.analyze, \"x\") > 10,\r\n        IsNotNull(resolveColumn(aliasedRelation.analyze, \"x\")),\r\n        resolveColumn(aliasedRelation.analyze, \"b\") <=> resolveColumn(aliasedRelation.analyze, \"y\"),\r\n        resolveColumn(aliasedRelation.analyze, \"z\") <=>\r\n          resolveColumn(aliasedRelation.analyze, \"x\"))))\r\n  }\r\n\r\n== FAIL: Constraints do not match ===\r\nFound: isnotnull(z#5),(z#5 > 10),(x#3 > 10),(z#5 <=> x#3),(b#1 <=> y#4),isnotnull(x#3)\r\nExpected: (x#3 > 10),isnotnull(x#3),(b#1 <=> y#4),(z#5 <=> x#3)\r\n== Result ==\r\nMissing: N/A\r\nFound but not expected: isnotnull(z#5),(z#5 > 10)\r\nHere i think as z has a EqualNullSafe comparison with x, so having isnotnull(z#5),(z#5 > 10) is redundant. If a query has lot of aliases, this may cause overhead leading to __java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: GC overhead limit exceeded__.\r\n\r\nSo i suggest

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen executing `toPandas` with Arrow enabled, partitions that arrive in the JVM out-of-order must be buffered before they can be send to Python. This causes an excess of memory to be used in the driver JVM and increases the time it takes to complete because data must sit in the JVM waiting for preceding partitions to come in.\r\n\r\nThis change sends un-ordered partitions to Python as soon as they arrive in the JVM, followed by a list of partition indices so that Python can assemble the data in the correct order. This way, data is not buffered at the JVM and there is no waiting on particular partitions so performance will be increased.\r\n\r\nFollowup to #21546 \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded new test with a large number of batches per partition, and test that forces a small delay in the first partition. These test that partitions are collected out-of-order and then are are put in the correct order in Python.\r\n\r\n## Performance Tests - toPandas\r\n\r\nTests run on a 4 node standalone cluster with 32 cores total, 14.04.1-Ubuntu and OpenJDK 8\r\nmeasured wall clock time to execute `toPandas()` and took the average best time of 5 runs/5 loops each.\r\n\r\nTest code\r\n```python\r\ndf = spark.range(1 << 25, numPartitions=32).toDF(\"id\").withColumn(\"x1\", rand()).withColumn(\"x2\", rand()).withColumn(\"x3\", rand()).withColumn(\"x4\", rand())\r\nfor i in range(5):\r\n\tstart = time.time()\r\n\t_ = df.toPandas()\r\n\telapsed = time.time() - start\r\n```\r\n\r\nSpark config\r\n```\r\nspark.driver.memory 5g\r\nspark.executor.memory 5g\r\nspark.driver.maxResultSize

\"_showstopper_\" flake8 issues that can halt the runtime with a SyntaxError, NameError, etc. Most other flake8 issues are merely \"style violations\" -- useful for readability but they do not effect runtime safety.\r\n* F821: undefined name `name`\r\n* F822: undefined name `name` in `__all__`\r\n* F823: local variable name referenced before assignment\r\n* E901: SyntaxError or

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nApache Spark doesn't create Hive table with duplicated fields in both case-sensitive and case-insensitive mode. However, if Spark creates ORC files in case-sensitive mode first and create Hive table on that location, where it's created. In this situation, field resolution should fail in case-insensitive mode. Otherwise, we don't know which columns will be returned or filtered. Previously, SPARK-25132 fixed the same issue in Parquet.\r\n\r\nHere is a simple example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nval data = spark.range(5).selectExpr(\"id as a\", \"id * 2 as A\")\r\nspark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.caseSensitive\", true)\r\ndata.write.format(\"orc\").mode(\"overwrite\").save(\"/user/hive/warehouse/orc_data\")\r\n\r\nsql(\"CREATE TABLE orc_data_source (A LONG) USING orc LOCATION '/user/hive/warehouse/orc_data'\")\r\nspark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.caseSensitive\", false)\r\nsql(\"select A from orc_data_source\").show\r\n+---+\r\n|  A|\r\n+---+\r\n|  3|\r\n|  2|\r\n|  4|\r\n|  1|\r\n|  0|\r\n+---+\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee #22148 for more details about parquet data source reader.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests added.","created_at":"2018-08-29T06:45:27Z","updated_at":"2018-09-10T05:11:50Z","closed_at":"2018-09-10T02:28:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f801ef518b6dfc7997094f5993ce7408d9f5d9f0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22262/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22262/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22262/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/26b4710bb47e700d3532da5652fd5ea3f128be20","head":{"label":"seancxmao:SPARK-25175","ref":"SPARK-25175","sha":"26b4710bb47e700d3532da5652fd5ea3f128be20","user":{"login":"seancxmao","id":12194089,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTk0MDg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12194089?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seancxmao","html_url":"https://github.com/seancxmao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seancxmao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seancxmao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seancxmao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seancxmao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seancxmao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seancxmao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seancxmao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seancxmao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seancxmao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":121346712,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjEzNDY3MTI=","name":"spark","full_name":"seancxmao/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"seancxmao","id":12194089,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTk0MDg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12194089?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seancxmao","html_url":"https://github.com/seancxmao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seancxmao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seancxmao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seancxmao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seancxmao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seancxmao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seancxmao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seancxmao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seancxmao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seancxmao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/seancxmao/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nBarrierCoordinator uses Timer and TimerTask. `TimerTask#cancel()` is invoked in ContextBarrierState#cancelTimerTask but `Timer#purge()` is never invoked.\r\n\r\nOnce a TimerTask is scheduled, the reference to it is not released until `Timer#purge()` is invoked even though `TimerTask#cancel()` is invoked.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis change improves how Spark on Kubernetes creates the local directories used for Spark scratch space i.e. `SPARK_LOCAL_DIRS`/`spark.local.dirs`\r\n\r\nCurrently Spark on Kubernetes creates each defined local directory, or a single default directory if none defined, as a Kubernetes `emptyDir` volume mounted into the containers.  The problem is that `emptyDir` directories are backed by the node storage and so for some compute environments e.g. diskless any \"local\" storage is actually provided by some remote file system that may actually harm performance when jobs use it heavily.\r\n\r\nKubernetes provides the option to have `emptyDir` volumes backed by `tmpfs` i.e. RAM on the nodes so we introduce a boolean `spark.kubernetes.local.dirs.tmpfs` option that when true causes the created `emptyDir` volumes to use memory.\r\n\r\nA second related problem is that because Spark on Kubernetes always generates `emptyDir` volumes users have no way to use alternative volume types that may be available in their cluster.\r\n\r\nNo new options specific to this problem are introduced but the code is modified to detect when the pod spec already defines an appropriately named volume and to avoid creating `emptyDir` volumes in this case.  This uses the convention of the existing code that volumes for scratch space are named `spark-local-dirs-N` numbered from 1-N based on the number of entries defined in the `SPARK_LOCAL_DIRS`/`spark.local.dirs` setting.  This is done in anticipation of the pod template feature form SPARK-24434 (PR #22146) being merged since that will allow users to define custom volumes more easily.\r\n\r\nTasks:\r\n\r\n- [x] Support using `tmpfs` volumes\r\n- [x] Support using pre-existing volumes\r\n- [x] Unit tests\r\n- [x] Documentation\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests added to the relevant feature step to exercise the new configuration option and to check that pre-existing volumes are used.  Plan to add further unit tests to check some other corner cases.","created_at":"2018-08-28T16:34:31Z","updated_at":"2018-09-07T07:50:06Z","closed_at":"2018-09-07T07:50:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"002e38bbf2b0e94028ddb6d10c0b171ee7ebe7be","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22256/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22256/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22256/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/90a5ae5e8529e546b14fd9e7f9ae8a21b648ed8e","head":{"label":"rvesse:SPARK-25262","ref":"SPARK-25262","sha":"90a5ae5e8529e546b14fd9e7f9ae8a21b648ed8e","user":{"login":"rvesse","id":2104864,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDQ4NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2104864?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvesse","html_url":"https://github.com/rvesse","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvesse/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvesse/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvesse/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvesse/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvesse/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvesse/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvesse/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvesse/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvesse/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":29888493,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTg4ODQ5Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"rvesse/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rvesse","id":2104864,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDQ4NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2104864?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvesse","html_url":"https://github.com/rvesse","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvesse/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvesse/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvesse/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvesse/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvesse/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvesse/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvesse/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvesse/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvesse/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rvesse/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`toAvroType` converts spark data type to avro schema. It always appends the record name to namespace so its impossible to have an Avro namespace independent of the record name.\r\n\r\n \r\nWhen invoked with a spark data type like,\r\n\r\n```java\r\nval sparkSchema = StructType(Seq(\r\n    StructField(\"name\", StringType, nullable = false),\r\n    StructField(\"address\", StructType(Seq(\r\n        StructField(\"city\", StringType, nullable = false),\r\n        StructField(\"state\", StringType, nullable = false))),\r\n    nullable = false)))\r\n \r\n// map it to an avro schema with record name \"employee\" and top level namespace \"foo.bar\",\r\nval avroSchema = SchemaConverters.toAvroType(sparkSchema,  false, \"employee\", \"foo.bar\")\r\n\r\n// result is\r\n// avroSchema.getName = employee\r\n// avroSchema.getNamespace = foo.bar.employee\r\n// avroSchema.getFullname = foo.bar.employee.employee\r\n```\r\nThe patch proposes to fix this so that the result is\r\n\r\n```\r\navroSchema.getName = employee\r\navroSchema.getNamespace = foo.bar\r\navroSchema.getFullname = foo.bar.employee\r\n```\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew and existing unit tests.\r\n\r\nPlease review http://spark.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull request.\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-28T08:04:10Z","updated_at":"2018-08-29T01:29:39Z","closed_at":"2018-08-29T01:29:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"580d0e6d76242d35b9eae35f6537db601a82f7cb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22251/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22251/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22251/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2153428f62dca7d462d17c85576426ecca52d1cb","head":{"label":"arunmahadevan:avro-fix","ref":"avro-fix","sha":"2153428f62dca7d462d17c85576426ecca52d1cb","user":{"login":"arunmahadevan","id":6792890,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3OTI4OTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6792890?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunmahadevan","html_url":"https://github.com/arunmahadevan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunmahadevan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunmahadevan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunmahadevan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunmahadevan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunmahadevan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunmahadevan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunmahadevan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunmahadevan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunmahadevan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":130400725,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzA0MDA3MjU=","name":"spark","full_name":"arunmahadevan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"arunmahadevan","id":6792890,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3OTI4OTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6792890?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunmahadevan","html_url":"https://github.com/arunmahadevan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunmahadevan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunmahadevan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunmahadevan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunmahadevan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunmahadevan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunmahadevan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunmahadevan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunmahadevan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arunmahadevan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/arunmahadevan/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the PR, I propose to switch `from_json` on `FailureSafeParser`, and to make the function compatible to `PERMISSIVE` mode by default, and to support the `FAILFAST` mode as well. The `DROPMALFORMED` mode is not supported by `from_json`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nIt was tested by existing `JsonSuite`/`CSVSuite`, `JsonFunctionsSuite` and `JsonExpressionsSuite` as well as new tests for `from_json` which checks different modes.\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-26T16:10:43Z","updated_at":"2019-08-17T13:35:25Z","closed_at":"2018-10-24T11:14:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"72a68ea3d310413603d5dba1495e927042e85503","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22237/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/22237/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/22237/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b2988c76456627e245bd8e157c76197fe4cc0ade","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:from_json-failuresafe","ref":"from_json-failuresafe","sha":"b2988c76456627e245bd8e157c76197fe4cc0ade","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

Instead of that I propose to do `scanPartitions` in parallel for top level partitions only.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI extended an existing test to trigger the

to update the inputMetrics\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn FileScanRdd, we will update inputMetrics's bytesRead using updateBytesRead  every 1000 rows or when close the iterator.\r\n\r\nbut when close the iterator,  we will invoke updateBytesReadWithFileSize to increase the inputMetrics's bytesRead with file's length.\r\n\r\nthis will result in the inputMetrics's bytesRead is wrong when run the query with limit such as select * from table limit 1.\r\n\r\nbecause we do not support for Hadoop 2.5 and earlier now, we always get the bytesRead from  Hadoop FileSystem statistics other than files's length.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nmanual
