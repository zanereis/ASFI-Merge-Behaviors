Please fill in the following information to help us review your PR more efficiently. -->\r\n\r\n## Brief Information\r\n\r\nThis pull request is in the type of:\r\n\r\n- [ ] bug fixing\r\n- [x] new feature\r\n- [ ] others\r\n\r\n### What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nAdd support for dynamically changing themes after chart initialization.\r\n\r\n### Fixed issues\r\n\r\n- #19556\r\n- #18716\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n### Before: What was the problem?\r\n\r\nCurrently, themes can only be set before chart initialization.\r\n\r\n```js\r\necharts.registerTheme('dark', darkTheme);\r\nconst chart = echarts.init(dom, 'dark');\r\n// You cannot change theme after chart is created unless dispose and reinit it.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere's no way to change themes dynamically after the chart is created.\r\n\r\nThe deprecated `setTheme` method in ECharts 3.0 was removed without a replacement.\r\n\r\n### After: How does it behave after the fixing?\r\n\r\nNow users can:\r\n1. Change themes dynamically using `chart.setTheme('themeName')` or `chart.setTheme(themeObject)` for registered themes\r\n2. If `themeName` is used, both the themes registered before or after the chart was created can be applied.\r\n3. Theme changes are applied immediately without needing to call `setOption`.\r\n\r\nExample usage:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// Using registered theme\r\necharts.registerTheme('dark', darkTheme);\r\nconst chart = echarts.init(dom);\r\nchart.setTheme('dark');\r\n\r\n// Dynamically register theme after chart is created\r\necharts.registerTheme('forest', forestTheme);\r\nchart.setTheme('forest');\r\n\r\n// The above is equivalent to:\r\nchart.setTheme(forestTheme);\r\n// The only difference is that forestTheme is an anonymous object, so it can't be reused for other charts.\r\n\r\n// Using theme object directly\r\nchart.setTheme({\r\n    backgroundColor: '#333',\r\n    title: {\r\n        textStyle: {\r\n            color: '#fff'\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Document Info\r\n\r\nOne of the following should be checked.\r\n\r\n- [ ] This PR doesn't relate to document changes\r\n- [x] The document should be updated later\r\n- [ ] The document changes have been made in apache/echarts-doc#xxx\r\n\r\n## Misc\r\n\r\n### ZRender Changes\r\n\r\n- [x] This PR doesn't depend on ZRender changes.\r\n\r\n### Related test cases or examples to use the new APIs\r\n\r\n- `test/theme.html`\r\n\r\n## Others\r\n\r\n### Merging options\r\n\r\n- [x] Please squash the commits into a single one when merging.\r\n\r\n### Other information\r\n\r\nThis PR is a pre-requisite for design token feature, with which we can dynamically change themes using design tokens.\r\n","created_at":"2025-01-21T08:50:44Z","updated_at":"2025-01-24T10:19:51Z","closed_at":"2025-01-23T11:36:44Z","merged_at":"2025-01-23T11:36:44Z","merge_commit_sha":"b5d1a83fff3178db5b0c51e0f0669a5580fe2ee8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1577042621,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTc3MDQyNjIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/labels/PR:%20author%20is%20committer","name":"PR:

ECharts. It's troublesome to make another theme and making it consistant with the light theme as well as adjusting to make sure there is enough contrast between the foreground and the background.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I propose a method to convert to dark mode without extra designing and developing.\r\n\r\nSee [zrender#1093](https://github.com/ecomfe/zrender/pull/1093) for more.\r\n\r\n## Document

Please fill in the following information to help us review your PR more efficiently. -->\r\n\r\n## Brief Information\r\n\r\nThis pull request is in the type of:\r\n\r\n- [ ] bug fixing\r\n- [x] new feature\r\n- [ ] others\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nAdd `'no-function-keys'` option to `RoamController` and `InsideZoomModel`, which are used for the 'dataZoom-inside' component.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Fixed issues\r\n\r\nFix #20646 \r\n\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n### Before: What was the problem?\r\n\r\n`moveOnMouseWheel`, `moveOnMouseMove`, `zoomOnMouseWheel` of 'dataZoom-inside' items will ever be trigger while they are set to `true` even there are function keys pressed down. This causing conflicts with other mouse operations configured with specific function key.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### After: How does it behave after the fixing?\r\n\r\n`moveOnMouseWheel`, `moveOnMouseMove`, `zoomOnMouseWheel` of 'dataZoom-inside' items will never be trigger while they are set to `'no-function-keys'` when there are function keys pressed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Document Info\r\n\r\nOne of the

Details\r\n\r\n### Before: What was the problem?\r\n\r\nUsers can only configure the style in the `geo.itemStyle` option after registering a GeoJSON map.\r\n\r\n\r\n### After: How does it behave after the fixing?\r\n\r\nUsers can directly style regions in original GeoJSON data like a theme.\r\n\r\n## Document Info\r\n\r\nOne of the following should be checked.\r\n\r\n- [ ] This PR doesn't relate to document changes\r\n- [x] The document should be updated later\r\n- [ ] The document changes have been made in apache/echarts-doc#xxx\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Misc\r\n\r\n### ZRender Changes\r\n\r\n- [ ]

Brief Information\r\n\r\nThis pull request is in the type of:\r\n\r\n- [ ] bug fixing\r\n- [x] new feature\r\n- [ ] others\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nEnhances the `grid.containLabel` property in ECharts to allow specifying the direction (`horizontal` or `vertical`) for label containment.\r\n\r\n### Fixed issues\r\n\r\n[#20540](https://github.com/apache/echarts/issues/20540)\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n### Before: What was the problem?\r\n\r\nThe `grid.containLabel` property was a simple boolean flag, which only enabled or disabled label containment. It lacked granularity, making it difficult to handle specific directions (e.g., only horizontal or vertical).\r\n\r\n### After: How does it behave after the fixing?\r\n\r\nThe `grid.containLabel` property now supports specifying the direction (`horizontal` or `vertical`) for label containment. This allows more precise control over grid size adjustments based on axis labels.\r\n\r\n## Document Info\r\n\r\nOne of the following should be checked.\r\n\r\n- [ ] This PR doesn't relate to document changes\r\n- [x] The document should be updated later\r\n- [ ] The document changes have been made in apache/echarts-doc#xxx\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Misc\r\n\r\n### ZRender Changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] This PR

Details\r\n\r\n### Before: What was the problem?\r\n\r\nCurrent impl of sunburst chart calculates label position in [SunburstPiece.ts](https://github.com/apache/echarts/blob/ca12fb489a83285040da20db4ea991ba90d4c685/src/chart/sunburst/SunburstPiece.ts#L185-L288), and apply it to all display state. However, this impl didn't take `labelLayout` into account and causes conflict as `labelLayout` is only applied to normal state for now.\r\n\r\nThis inconsistency causes strange animation on mouse hover.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### After: How does it behave after the fixing?\r\n\r\nNow with this pr, `labelLayout` always takes priority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Document Info\r\n\r\nOne of the following should be checked.\r\n\r\n- [x] This PR doesn't relate to document changes\r\n- [ ] The document should be updated later\r\n- [ ] The document changes have been made in apache/echarts-doc#xxx\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Misc\r\n\r\n### ZRender Changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] This PR depends on ZRender changes (ecomfe/zrender#xxx).\r\n\r\n### Related test cases or examples to use the new APIs\r\n\r\nN.A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Others\r\n\r\n### Merging options\r\n\r\n- [ ] Please squash the commits into a single one when merging.\r\n\r\n### Other information\r\n\r\nAs an inexperienced front-end developer, this PR may require more reviews to avoid breaking any existing use cases. Also, I am currently unable to add unit tests for this PR, which may require further processing.","created_at":"2024-11-06T01:31:18Z","updated_at":"2024-11-07T07:49:29Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2cb6cf6272052525892b9b36b246db1236a82d98","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1577024536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTc3MDI0NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/labels/PR:%20awaiting%20review","name":"PR:

plot to render correctly.\r\n\r\n### Fixed issues\r\n\r\n- #18850: Setting up the DataZoom renders part of the plot.\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n### Before: What was the problem?\r\n\r\n<!-- DESCRIBE THE BUG OR REQUIREMENT HERE. -->\r\nIn the previous implementation, the DataZoom component failed to refresh the entire plot area after zoom interactions, causing only parts of the plot to render, while the rest remained unrefreshed or partially visible.\r\n\r\n<!-- ADD SCREENSHOT HERE IF APPLICABLE. -->\r\n#### Screenshot Before Fix (Optional)\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5663d5fa-af22-4c69-b6e0-74ef53a00354)\r\n\r\n\r\n### After: How does it behave after the fixing?\r\n\r\n<!-- THE RESULT AFTER FIXING AND A SIMPLE EXPLANATION ABOUT HOW IT IS FIXED. -->\r\nAfter applying this fix, the DataZoom component now fully refreshes the plot area, rendering the entire visual correctly after user interactions like zooming or panning. This was achieved by adding a `dispatchAction` call in the `render` method, forcing the view to reset and display the specified data range from 0 to 100%.\r\n\r\n<!-- ADD SCREENSHOT HERE IF

Brief Information\r\n\r\nThis pull request is in the type of:\r\n\r\n- [x] bug fixing\r\n- [ ] new feature\r\n- [ ] others\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nFixes issue with series.encode for boxplot when category axis is used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Fixed issues\r\n#20319 \r\n\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n### Before: What was the problem?\r\n\r\nWhen a category axis is used for a boxplot series, an ordinalValue is always inserted to the series.data which breaks any encoding rules. if the category axis does not set it's own data then the axis labels will be the integer ordinalValue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### After: How does it behave after the fixing?\r\n\r\nNow if an encode rule is applied for the associated axis (x/y) then the ordinalValue is not inserted and the encoding rules work as expected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Document Info\r\n\r\nOne of the following should be checked.\r\n\r\n- [x] This PR doesn't relate to document changes\r\n- [ ] The document should be

Brief Information\r\n\r\nThis pull request is in the type of:\r\n\r\n- [x] bug fixing\r\n- [ ] new feature\r\n- [ ] others\r\n\r\n\r\n### What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis fixes the minmax sampling behaviour to follow the standard as described [here](https://www.ni.com/docs/en-US/bundle/labview/page/memory-management-for-large-data-sets.html#d87745e217).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Fixed issues\r\n\r\nNo open issue, but the problem was discussed in the original PR for this feature: https://github.com/apache/echarts/pull/19279#issuecomment-2131424868\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n### Before: What was the problem?\r\n\r\nI generated some fake data, 16000 data points for each graph (green random walk, yellow sine wave, and blue pseudo-random).\r\nI added two artificial \"spikes\" for each graph: a downward spike at index 7000, and an upward spike at index 9000.\r\n\r\n| No downsampling | Original minmax downsampling implementation |\r\n|----------|-----------|\r\n| ![NoDownsampling_16kpoints_across_1604pixels](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9da9cf2-525b-4cb6-8282-a890318e337f) | ![OriginalMinMaxDownsampling](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2dc46f8-d776-42ca-84d6-507876fd8e70) |\r\n\r\nThe original minmax implementation appears to act just like the \"max\" downsampling method for data points that are above y=0, and thereby it misses out on any downward spikes. \r\n\r\n### After: How does it behave after the fixing?\r\n\r\n| No downsampling | New minmax downsampling implementation (2pts per px) |\r\n|----------|-----------|\r\n| ![NoDownsampling_16kpoints_across_1604pixels](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9da9cf2-525b-4cb6-8282-a890318e337f) | ![NewMinMaxDownsampling_2points_per_pixel](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/605d7dff-fd82-426a-b345-02602129f29c) |\r\n\r\nThe new implementation more closely follows the actual trend, and ensures that it captures all up and down spikes.\r\n\r\nBrief example of the minmax downsampling method, as described [here](https://www.ni.com/docs/en-US/bundle/labview/page/memory-management-for-large-data-sets.html#d87745e217):\r\n\r\n1. Example data: [4, 1, 7, 8, 3, 6, 5, 9, 2, 7, 8, 1]\r\n2. Frame size of 3: [(4, 1, 7), (8, 3, 6), (5, 9, 2), (7, 8, 1)]\r\n3. Identify the min and max within each frame: [(4, <ins>1</ins>, <ins>7</ins>), (<ins>8</ins>, <ins>3</ins>, 6), (5, <ins>9</ins>, <ins>2</ins>), (7, <ins>8</ins>, <ins>1</ins>)]\r\n4. Keep the order of the min and max within each group, and those become the resulting downsampled set: [1, 7, 8, 3, 9, 2, 8, 1]\r\n\r\n<ins>Discussion Point A</ins>: the link above suggests using two frames for each pixel, whereby each frame results in two data points, for a total density of 4 data points per pixel. Personally I think this is a bit overkill, as it results in less performance for minimal graph quality increase.\r\nThe current implementation in this PR has 2 data points per pixel, however this could be halved to 1 data point if you agree. The benefit of 1 data point per pixel is that the graph is more likely to allow graph animations, whereas the higher density may be above the threshold for animations still to play.\r\nSee comparison below:\r\n\r\n| No downsampling | New minmax downsampling implementation (2pts per px) |\r\n|----------|-----------|\r\n| ![NoDownsampling_16kpoints_across_1604pixels](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9da9cf2-525b-4cb6-8282-a890318e337f) | ![NewMinMaxDownsampling_2points_per_pixel](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/605d7dff-fd82-426a-b345-02602129f29c) |\r\n\r\n| As suggested by link (4pts per px) | Doubled rate for 1pt per px |\r\n|-------|--------|\r\n| ![NewMinMaxDownsampling_4points_per_pixel](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bcd264ba-5046-4128-ad30-ba05325b6bb9) | ![NewMinMaxDownsampling_1point_per_pixel](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2e60af6-4910-434e-b2ef-1f715b778f23) |\r\n\r\nI suggest opening the images in fullscreen for a better comparison.\r\n\r\n<ins>Discussion Point B</ins>: Regarding the code, I referenced the lttb method for implementing this minmax method in a similar way (i.e. having a separate function for downsampling), since the regular downsampling method would not work due to the minmax method requiring the ability to output two samples per frame. It may be needed to add an extra condition to the downsample method selection logic, to check if the rate is high enough (>2) to warrant downsampling, since this method isn't as efficient as the others. However, this will depend on the decision for Discussion Point A above.\r\n\r\n## Document Info\r\n\r\nOne of the following should be checked.\r\n\r\n- [x] This PR doesn't relate to document

Brief Information\r\n\r\nThis pull request is in the type of:\r\n\r\n- [x] bug fixing\r\n- [ ] new feature\r\n- [ ] others\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### What does this PR do?\r\n\r\n<!-- USE ONE SENTENCE TO DESCRIBE WHAT THIS PR DOES. -->\r\nIt switches visualMap handle label vertical align property basing on the visual map orientation and layout.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Fixed issues\r\n\r\n- Fix #20248  \r\n\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n### Before: What was the problem?\r\n\r\nLabel for handle at minimum position collides with the handle. The reason is that the distance between label and handle is based on the handle size and it changes depending on handle position. Currently label has always verticalAlign set to \"middle\", which is the cause of the collision (when distance is less than the half of the label height, the items collide). For labels below, vertical align could be \"top\" and for labels above, vertical align could be \"bottom\".\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1103\" alt=\"before\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7bf2b7c9-ee11-4268-8432-42b3a59d3543\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### After: How does it behave after the fixing?\r\n\r\nThe labels below maximum range in horizontal visualMap get a slight offset to avoid collision.\r\nThis solution is not perfect, as the calculation method is different for vertical and horizontal visualMap, but I see no better way for now, to both fix the issue and keep other labels positions unchanged.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2024-08-13 at 12 05 41](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c3f5fd2-fa79-4279-882d-f0aa0475e920)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Document Info\r\n\r\nOne of the following should be checked.\r\n\r\n- [x] This PR doesn't relate to document changes\r\n- [ ] The document should be updated later\r\n- [ ] The document changes have

feature\r\n- [ ] others\r\n\r\n### What does this PR do?\r\n\r\n<!-- USE ONE SENTENCE TO DESCRIBE WHAT THIS PR DOES. -->\r\nAdded a method to calculate the bandwidth of the time axis, and fixed the problem of not displaying the width when the axisPointer type is shadow.\r\n添加时间坐标轴关于bandwidth的计算方法，修复axisPointer type为shadow时，不显示宽度的问题\r\n\r\n### Fixed issues\r\n- #9843\r\n- #15411 \r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n### Before: What was the problem?\r\n<!-- DESCRIBE THE BUG OR REQUIREMENT HERE. -->\r\nThe intervals between timestamp data may be uneven, so the difference in data length cannot accurately reflect the number of data points, resulting in the inability to calculate the correct bandwidth value for the time type axis. When the `axisPointer` type is `shadow`, only a line close to 0 is displayed.\r\n时间戳数据之间的间隔可能不均匀，因此数据长度的差值无法准确反映数据点数量，导致时间类型的轴无法计算得到正确的bandwidth值，当axispointer的type为shadow的时候，只显示一条接近于0的线\r\n<!-- ADD SCREENSHOT HERE IF APPLICABLE. -->\r\n<img width=\"610\" alt=\"截屏2024-08-07 01 45 14\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4672b4a0-ac97-4e99-b1c0-8448fb557df8\">\r\n\r\n### After: How does it behave after the fixing?\r\n<!-- THE RESULT AFTER FIXING AND A SIMPLE EXPLANATION ABOUT HOW IT IS FIXED. -->\r\nAdded a method to calculate data length. When the axis type is time, the `_approxInterval` attribute is used to represent the average interval of the time scale. By dividing by this interval and rounding up, the number of data points can be estimated more accurately.\r\n添加数据长度的计算方法，当轴的类型为时间时，利用_approxInterval 属性代表时间刻度的平均间隔，通过除以这个间隔并向上取整，可以更准确地估算出数据点的数量，从而得到有宽度的矩形高亮区\r\n<!-- ADD SCREENSHOT HERE IF APPLICABLE. -->\r\n<img width=\"601\" alt=\"截屏2024-08-07 01 44 39\"

Please fill in the following information to help us review your PR more efficiently. -->\r\n\r\n## Brief Information\r\n\r\nThis pull request is in the type of:\r\n\r\n- [ ] bug fixing\r\n- [x] new feature\r\n- [ ] others\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nCustom series provide a powerful way to let developers define their own charts. But for now, it's hard to reuse the `renderItem` for other projects or other developers. This PR provides a way to register custom series so that developer A can make a custom series and publish it (probably by npm) and developer B can use it by simply setting `renderItem` to the related name.\r\n\r\n### Fixed issues\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n- #xxxx: ...\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n### Before: What was the problem?\r\n\r\nCustom series is hard to be reused.\r\n\r\n### After: How does it behave after the fixing?\r\n\r\n#### Making a reusable custom series:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst renderItem = (params, api) => {\r\n    return {\r\n        type: 'circle',\r\n        shape: {\r\n            cx: api.coord([api.value(0), api.value(1)])[0],\r\n            cy: api.coord([api.value(0), api.value(1)])[1],\r\n            r: api.value(2) * (params.itemPayload.scale || 1)\r\n        },\r\n        style: {\r\n            fill: api.visual('color'),\r\n            opacity: params.itemPayload.opacity() || 1,\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n};\r\necharts.registerCustomSeries('bubble', renderItem);\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Using the above custom series:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n\r\nconst option = {\r\n    xAxis: {},\r\n    yAxis: {},\r\n    series: {\r\n        type: 'custom',\r\n        renderItem: 'bubble',\r\n        itemPayload: {\r\n            scale: 2,\r\n            opacity: () => Math.random() * 0.5 + 0.5\r\n        },\r\n        data: [[11, 22, 20], [33, 44, 40], [18, 24, 10]]\r\n    }\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Document Info\r\n\r\nOne of the following should be checked.\r\n\r\n- [ ] This PR doesn't relate to document changes\r\n- [x] The document should be updated

Please fill in the following information to help us review your PR more efficiently. -->\r\n\r\n## Brief Information\r\n\r\nThis pull request is in the type of:\r\n\r\n- [x] bug fixing\r\n- [ ] new feature\r\n- [ ] others\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### What does this PR do?\r\n\r\n<!-- USE ONE SENTENCE TO DESCRIBE WHAT THIS PR DOES. -->\r\n\r\nWhen angleAxis in the polar system has `boundaryGap: false`, the extent is adjusted since [this commit](https://github.com/apache/echarts/commit/2fcdde6ea773514ff34e2eceece1c97bfe2ebb47#diff-43424e7431043adf45e3aba374fe74528fe1475b0e098246b6e4454578fc1aa5R127-R130) so that polar bars don't overlap each other. The main idea is to make extra space according to data count. But it may overkill in some situations.\r\n\r\n### Fixed issues\r\n\r\nNA.\r\n\r\nThis PR is not a fix to #20172 , which is not a bug.\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n### Before: What was the problem?\r\n\r\nConsider the case when `startAngle: 90, endAngle: -90`, before this PR, it has the result of:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"468\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/114eb20d-d205-47f6-9923-ce8d34c19516\">\r\n\r\nThis is not as expected because a developer set `startAngle: 90, endAngle: -90` would expect the range to be half a circle.\r\n\r\n### After: How does it behave after the fixing?\r\n\r\nThe extent of angleAxis with `boundaryGap: false` should only be adjusted if it has the potential to overlap, that is to say, `startAngle: 90, endAngle: -90` should still get half a circle:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"502\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/208e9194-7c2a-4c4c-8df7-bd54a05a67bf\">\r\n\r\nwhile `startAngle: 90, endAngle: -270` should get 3/4 of a circle:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"561\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/afd918b4-da27-464c-9682-5467302a2ba4\">\r\n\r\nPlease also not that if the range of startAngle and endAngle itself is over 360 degrees, it won't adjust to be smaller than a circle because it is not expected to.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"691\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b960c4b0-0e30-48bd-a65f-6092839a1713\">\r\n\r\n\r\n## Document Info\r\n\r\nOne of the following should be checked.\r\n\r\n- [x] This PR doesn't relate

DESCRIBE WHAT THIS PR DOES. -->\r\nThis PR fixes some zoom issues in DataZoom\r\n\r\n\r\n### Fixed issues\r\n\r\n- Fixed sideway scrolling when reaching max or min span in DataZoom\r\n- Fixed zooming disproportion in DataZoom if there is more than one axis (keep the same ratio for x and y axis)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n### Before: What was the problem?\r\n1.  When using mouse wheel to zoom in/out, it will start sideway scrolling when it reaches the max/min span.\r\n![zoom in out before](https://github.com/pulsarplatform/echarts/assets/126215214/595860a4-3e59-4e7b-bceb-8b1832eb13c9)\r\n\r\n2. Sometimes on zoom out, the zoom ration will become inconsistent and causing a disproportional view.\r\n<img width=\"794\" alt=\"before\" src=\"https://github.com/pulsarplatform/echarts/assets/126215214/ea1e85d1-4cbf-4921-b2d4-67dbfdc3647c\">\r\n\r\n### After: How does it behave after the fixing?\r\n\r\n1. Fixed effect: it will stop at the max/min span\r\n![zoom in out after](https://github.com/pulsarplatform/echarts/assets/126215214/fee8ab4b-2852-46fc-8d86-14296c7dfead)\r\n\r\n2.

Please fill in the following information to help us review your PR more efficiently. -->\r\n\r\n## Brief Information\r\n\r\nThis pull request is in the type of:\r\n- [ ] bug fixing\r\n- [x] new feature\r\n- [ ] others\r\n\r\n### What does this PR do?\r\n添加\"删除坐标轴指定刻度上的分隔线\"的功能\r\nAdd feature `showMinLine` `showMaxLine` to splitline in coordinate axis\r\n\r\n### Fixed issues\r\n- fix #20053\r\n- fix #16946\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n### Before: What was the problem?\r\n用户无法自定义删除任意刻度上的分割线\r\n当 xAxis 选项中的 splitline 属性与 yAxis 选项中的 axisLine 属性同时设置时，两条线会在 yAxis 轴线所在的位置重叠\r\nUser cannot customize the deletion of dividing lines on any scale.\r\nWhile splitline attr in xAxis options and axisLine atrr in yAxis options set concurrently, two lines from each other overlapper in the position where yAxis axisline lies.\r\n\r\n### After: How does it behave after the fixing?\r\n用户可以将 `showMinLine` 或 `showMaxLine` 设置为 `false`，从而删除第一条或最后一条分割线\r\nUser can set the `showMinLine`/ `showMaxLine` be `false`  to delete the first/last split line.\r\n```javascript\r\nxAxis: {\r\n  type: 'category',\r\n  data: ['Mon', 'Tue', 'Wed', 'Thu', 'Fri', 'Sat', 'Sun'],\r\n  splitLine: {\r\n    show: true,\r\n    showMinLine: false,  // do not show the first splitLine\r\n    showMaxLine: false,  // do not show the last splitLine\r\n    lineStyle: { color: 'black', width:3 }\r\n},\r\n```\r\n<img width=\"1280\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/echarts/assets/55272646/c70431c3-407b-4666-9fd4-b95d1aaa2114\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### Note\r\n在调试代码的过程中发现`ticksCoords`数组中没有给刻度线右侧的点设置`tickValue`，这会影响在后续查询隐藏线条的绘制，所以修改了 Axis.ts 的`getTicksCoords`方法\r\nWhile debugging the code, I found that the `ticksCoords` array did not set `tickValue` for the points on the left and right sides of the tick mark, which would affect the drawing of hidden lines in subsequent queries, so I modified the `getTicksCoords` method of Axis.ts\r\n![截屏2024-07-03 16 49 15](https://github.com/apache/echarts/assets/55272646/e477d29f-3618-4209-bbe9-555021b7526d)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Document Info\r\n\r\nOne of the following should be

feature\r\n- [ ] others\r\n\r\n### What does this PR do?\r\n添加\"删除坐标轴指定刻度上的分隔线\"的功能\r\nAdd feature to remove SplitLine on specified tick in coordinate axis\r\n\r\n### Fixed issues\r\n- #20053 \r\n\r\n## Details\r\n### Before: What was the problem?\r\n用户无法自定义删除任意刻度上的分割线\r\n当 xAxis 选项中的 splitline 属性与 yAxis 选项中的 axisLine 属性同时设置时，两条线会在 yAxis 轴线所在的位置重叠\r\nUser cannot customize the deletion of dividing lines on any scale.\r\nWhile splitline attr in xAxis options and axisLine atrr in yAxis options set concurrently, two lines from each other overlapper in the position where yAxis axisline lies.\r\n\r\n### After: How does it behave after the fixing?\r\n用户可以在 `hiddenTicks` 数组中添加要删除的刻度索引，从而删除对应的分割线\r\nUser can add the tick index to be deleted in the hiddenTicks array to delete the corresponding dividing line.\r\n```javascript\r\nxAxis: {\r\n  type: 'category',\r\n  data: ['Mon', 'Tue', 'Wed', 'Thu', 'Fri', 'Sat', 'Sun'],\r\n  splitLine: {\r\n    show: true,\r\n    hiddenTicks: [0,1,2,5,7],\r\n    lineStyle: { color: 'black', width:3 }\r\n},\r\n```\r\n<img width=\"971\" alt=\"截屏2024-07-03 16 55 23\"

的`getTicksCoords`方法\r\nWhile debugging the code, I found that the `ticksCoords` array did not set `tickValue` for the points on the left and right sides of the tick mark, which would affect the drawing of hidden lines in subsequent queries, so I modified the `getTicksCoords` method of Axis.ts\r\n![截屏2024-07-03 16 49
