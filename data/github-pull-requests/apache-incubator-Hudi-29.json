Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR renames `HoodieDeltaStreamer` to `HoodieStreamer` and moves relevant classes from `org.apache.hudi.utilities.deltastreamer` to `org.apache.hudi.utilities.streamer` for better naming.  The changes are backwards compatible so that old classes can still still work, though deprecated, including `DeltaSync`, `DeltastreamerMultiWriterCkptUpdateFunc`, `HoodieDeltastreamer`, `HoodieDeltastreamerMetrics`, `HoodieMultiTableDeltastreamer`, `NoNewDataTerminationStrategy`, and `PostWriteTerminationStrategy`.\r\n\r\nNote that classes that are added after 0.13.0 release, such as `BaseErrorTableWriter` and `HoodieDeltaStreamerConfig`, are directly relocated and/or renamed.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nImproves the naming.\r\n\r\nAll tests still use the old naming except for config name references which are not relevant.  They still pass, meaning that the changes are backward compatible.\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nDocs update ticket: HUDI-6520\r\n\r\n### Contributor's

Change Logs\r\n\r\nWith the intent to simplify different config options with INSERT_INTO spark-sql, we are doing a overhaul. We have 3 to 4 configs with INSERT_INTO like Operation type, insert mode, drop dupes, enable bulk insert configs. Here is what the simplification brings in. \r\n\r\n```\r\n- We will introduce a new config named \"hoodie.sql.write.operation\" which will have 3 values (\"insert\", \"bulk_insert\" and \"upsert\"). Default value will be \"insert\" for INSERT_INTO.\r\n         - Deprecate hoodie.sql.insert.mode and \"hoodie.sql.bulk.insert.enable\".\r\n         - Also, enable \"hoodie.merge.allow.duplicate.on.inserts\" = true if operation type is \"Insert\" for both spark-sql and spark-ds. This will maintain duplicates but still help w/ small file management with \"insert\"s.\r\n- Introduce a new config named \"hoodie.datasource.insert.dedupe.policy\" whose valid values are \"ignore, fail and drop\". Make \"ignore\" as default. \"fail\" will mimic \"STRICT\" mode we support as of now. \r\n         - Deprecate hoodie.datasource.insert.drop.dups.\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen both old and new configs are set, new config will take effect. \r\nWhen only new configs are set, new config will take effect. \r\nWhen neither is set, new configs and their default will take effect. \r\nWhen only old configs are set, old configs will take effect. Please do note that we are deprecating the use of these old configs. In 2 releases, we will completely remove these configs. So, would recommend users to migrate to new configs. \r\n\r\nNote: old refers to \"hoodie.sql.insert.mode\" and new config refers to \"hoodie.sql.write.operation\".\r\n\r\nBehavior change: \r\nWith this patch, we are also switching the default behavior with INSERT_INTO to use \"insert\" as the operation underneath. Until 0.13.1, default behavior was \"upsert\". In other words, if you ingest same batch of records in commit1 and in commit2, hudi will do an upsert and will return only the latest value with snapshot read. But with this patch, we are changing the default behavior to use \"insert\" as the name (INSERT_INTO) signifies. So, ingesting the same batch of records in commit1 and in commit2 will result in duplicates records with snapshot read. If users override the respective config, we will honor them, but the default behavior where none of the respective configs are overridden explicitly, will see a behavior change. \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nUsability will be improved for spark-sql users as we have deprecated few confusing configs and tried to align with spark datasource writes. Also, this brings in a behavior change as well. With this patch, we are also switching the default behavior with INSERT_INTO to use \"insert\" as the operation underneath. Until 0.13.1, default behavior was \"upsert\". In other words, if you ingest same batch of records in commit1 and in commit2, hudi will do an upsert and will return only the latest value with snapshot read. But with this patch, we are changing the default behavior to use \"insert\" as the name (INSERT_INTO) signifies. So, ingesting the same batch of records in commit1 and in commit2 will result in duplicates records with snapshot read. If users override the respective config, we will honor them, but the default behavior where none of the respective configs are overridden explicitly, will see a behavior change. \r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nmedium\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nWe will have to call out the behavior change as part of our release docs and also update our quick start guide around the same. \r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-6479\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-05T02:33:50Z","updated_at":"2024-02-26T08:17:31Z","closed_at":"2023-07-16T17:03:26Z","merged_at":"2023-07-16T17:03:26Z","merge_commit_sha":"e039dd7caff3178eab2b07eba7d7c8cf4069b2fd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2610270804,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjEwMjcwODA0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/priority:blocker","name":"priority:blocker","color":"78FA72","default":false,"description":""},{"id":5187724363,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBI7nWM8AAAABNTZkSw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/release-0.14.0","name":"release-0.14.0","color":"B9BAA3","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/9123/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/9123/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/9123/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/statuses/05554e2e034b32dd56599e1f62408c123888d9cb","head":{"label":"nsivabalan:insert_into_overhaul","ref":"insert_into_overhaul","sha":"05554e2e034b32dd56599e1f62408c123888d9cb","user":{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":159547623,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTk1NDc2MjM=","name":"hudi","full_name":"nsivabalan/hudi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan/hudi","description":"Spark

Mainly toward stream write and append write. Tests will be added after the overall design is approved. \r\n\r\nNote that OperatorCoodinator does not support getting `metricGroup`  in the current hudi flink version(1.17.1), so this PR will not include metrics like commit metrics(see #3235) that can only gather by StreamWriteCoordinator. We add task manager metrics only in this pr. \r\n\r\nThis pr is following #3235 and fixed #6984. \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nfixed #6984. \r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high

Change Logs\r\n\r\n#9058 added support for deletes in RLI. However, it missed a corner case when there are deletes with partition path updates. As a result, `TestGlobalIndexEnableUpdatePartitions` started failing. This PR attempts to fix the issue.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nFixes deletes handling in rli  when partition path is updated. \r\nWhen a record moves from 1 partition to another and if Update partition path is set to true, two records are added to RLI partition (1 for delete and 1 for addition), but the behavior is undefined. So, we have to introduce a reducebyKey when we prepare records for RLI. We can do some optimization like avoiding reducebyKey if update partition path is not set to true, for now, wish to unblock master asap. \r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nWhen upgrade hudi from 0.12.2->0.13.1, I found spark's capcity of insert overwrite partitioned table with dynamic partition lost,\r\nsee https://github.com/apache/hudi/issues/8283#issuecomment-1482745990: \r\n  It will cause serious data problems if upgrade to 0.13.1, user will delete all data by mistake\r\nAs https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/7365#issuecomment-1338371540 mentioned, \r\n  `insert_overwrite_table` will override entire table. while `insert_overwrite_partition` will overwrite only matching partitions.\r\nNow we can only use static partition syntax to realize `insert_overwrite_partition` semantics.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\n1) Keep insert overwrite semantics  to be forward compatible(recover dynamic partition capcity) \r\n2) Realize `insert_overwrite_table` semantics  with partitioned table as https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/7365#issue-1472566386 mentioned using a config(set hoodie.datasource.write.operation = insert_overwrite_table)\r\n3) Use append mode to not delete whole table data as https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/8076#discussion_r1127283648 mentioned\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nMedia\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-03T09:36:53Z","updated_at":"2023-11-03T08:13:54Z","closed_at":"2023-08-03T00:29:38Z","merged_at":"2023-08-03T00:29:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"d67455a4a713e295bba1d0a5d338fcfbe5af217e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2610270804,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjEwMjcwODA0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/priority:blocker","name":"priority:blocker","color":"78FA72","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4852998287,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBI7nWM8AAAABIULgjw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/data-consistency","name":"data-consistency","color":"AA4D40","default":false,"description":"phantoms,

from [GitHub Security Lab](https://securitylab.github.com/)!\n\nYour repository is critical to the security of the Open Source Software (OSS) ecosystem, and as part of our mission to make OSS safer, we are contributing a [CodeQL configuration for code scanning](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning-for-a-repository#setting-up-code-scanning-manually) to your repository. By enabling code scanning with CodeQL, you will be able to continuously analyze your code and surface potential vulnerabilities [before they can even reach your codebase](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/triaging-code-scanning-alerts-in-pull-requests#about-code-scanning-results-on-pull-requests).\n\n![](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-182394/mw-1440/images/help/repository/code-scanning-pr-conversation-tab.webp)\n\nWe’ve tested the configuration manually before opening this pull request and adjusted it to the needs of your particular repository, but feel free to tweak it further! Check [this page](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning#editing-a-code-scanning-workflow) for detailed documentation.\n\nQuestions? Check out the FAQ below!\n\n### FAQ\n<details>\n<summary>Click here to expand the FAQ section</summary>\n\n#### How often will the code scanning analysis run?\nBy default, code scanning will trigger a scan with the CodeQL engine on the following events:\n* On every pull request — to flag up potential security problems for you to investigate before merging a PR.\n* On every push to your default branch and other protected branches — this keeps the analysis results on your repository’s *Security* tab up to date.\n* Once a week at a fixed time — to make sure you benefit from the latest updated security analysis even when no code was committed or PRs were opened.\n\n#### What will this cost?\nNothing! The CodeQL engine will run inside GitHub Actions, making use of your [unlimited free compute minutes for public repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/usage-limits-billing-and-administration#about-billing-for-github-actions).\n\n#### Where can I see the results of the analysis?\nThe results of the analysis will be available on the *Security* tab of your repository. You can find more information about the results [here](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/managing-code-scanning-alerts-for-your-repository#viewing-the-alerts-for-a-repository).\n\n![](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-17804/mw-1440/images/help/repository/security-tab.webp)\n\nFor Pull Requests, you can find the results of the analysis in the *Checks* tab. You can find more information about the Pull Request results [here](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/triaging-code-scanning-alerts-in-pull-requests#about-code-scanning-as-a-pull-request-check).\n\n![](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-74306/mw-1440/images/help/repository/code-scanning-results-check.webp)\n\n#### What types of problems does CodeQL find?\nCodeQL queries are hosted in the [`github/codeql`](https://github.com/github/codeql) repository.\n\nBy default, code scanning runs the [`default` query suite](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/built-in-codeql-query-suites#default-query-suite). The queries in the `default` query suite are highly precise and return few false positive code scanning results.\n\nIf you are looking for a more comprehensive analysis, which could return a greater number of false positives, you can enable the [`security-extended` query suite](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/built-in-codeql-query-suites#security-extended-query-suite) in the `queries` option of `github/codeql-action/init`.\n\nIn the event of finding a false positive, please create a [false positive Issue](https://github.com/github/codeql/issues/new?assignees=&labels=false-positive&projects=&template=ql--false-positive.md&title=False+positive) in [`github/codeql`](https://github.com/github/codeql) so we can investigate and improve the query in question. You can also contribute to the query by opening a pull request against [`github/codeql`](https://github.com/github/codeql).\n\n#### How do I customize the analysis?\nYou can customize the analysis by using a CodeQL configuration file. This way, you can specify which queries should [not] be run, and/or which files should be excluded from the analysis. You can find more information about the configuration file [here](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/customizing-code-scanning#using-a-custom-configuration-file).\n\n#### How do I upgrade my CodeQL engine?\nNo need! New versions of the CodeQL analysis are constantly deployed on GitHub.com; your repository will automatically benefit from the most recently released version.\n\n#### The analysis doesn’t seem to be working\nIf you get an error in GitHub Actions that indicates that CodeQL wasn’t able to analyze your code, please [follow the instructions here](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/troubleshooting-the-codeql-workflow) to debug the analysis.\n\n#### Which source code hosting platforms does code scanning support?\nGitHub code scanning is deeply integrated within GitHub itself. If you’d like to scan source code that is hosted elsewhere, we suggest that you create a mirror of that code on GitHub.\n\n</details>

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the interface for Hudi client init callback to run custom logic at the time of initialization of a Hudi client:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@PublicAPIClass(maturity = ApiMaturityLevel.EVOLVING)\r\npublic interface HoodieClientInitCallback {\r\n  /**\r\n   * A callback method in which the user can implement custom logic.\r\n   * This method is called when a {@link BaseHoodieClient} is initialized.\r\n   *\r\n   * @param hoodieClient {@link BaseHoodieClient} instance.\r\n   */\r\n  @PublicAPIMethod(maturity = ApiMaturityLevel.EVOLVING)\r\n  void call(BaseHoodieClient hoodieClient);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt the time of instantiation of the write or table service client, a user may want to do additional processing, such as sending metrics, logsm notification, or adding more properties to the write config.  The implementation of client init callback interface allows such logic to be plugged into Hudi.\r\n\r\nA new config, `hoodie.client.init.callback.classes`, is added for plugging in the callback implementation.  The class list is comma-separated.\r\n\r\nNew tests are added and the behavior is expected.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nAdds new functionality of client init callback to run custom logic at the time of initialization of a Hudi client.\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nWill update the Hudi docs.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-01T05:46:20Z","updated_at":"2023-07-04T05:18:38Z","closed_at":"2023-07-04T05:18:37Z","merged_at":"2023-07-04T05:18:37Z","merge_commit_sha":"4bba6af0fa104ad8eef0ecd62e0aedf67bbe33a4","assignee":{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2610270804,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjEwMjcwODA0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/priority:blocker","name":"priority:blocker","color":"78FA72","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2719846715,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE5ODQ2NzE1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/writer-core","name":"writer-core","color":"3F460E","default":false,"description":"Issues

Some fixes to improve the MDT and record index code base.\n\n### Change Logs\n\n1. Print MDT partition name instead of the enum tostring in logs\n2. Use fsView.loadAllPartitions()\n3. When publishing size metrics for MDT, only consider partitions which have been initialized\n4. Fixed job status names\n5. Limited logs which were printing the entire list of partitions. This is very verbose for datasets with large number of partitions\n6. Added a config to reduce the max parallelism of record index initialization.\n7. Changed defaults for MDT write configs to reasonable values\n8. Added config for MDT logBlock size. Larger blocks are preferred to reduce lookup time.\n9. Fixed the size metrics for MDT.

But this behavior is actually expected because we never implement cascading behavior for AwsGlueCatalogSyncClient [LOC](https://github.com/apache/hudi/blob/dc3aa399ffc4875abba7be5833ebabca222eb6ff/hudi-aws/src/main/java/org/apache/hudi/aws/sync/AWSGlueCatalogSyncClient.java#L333)\r\n\r\nThis would cause problems when users change their schema later on. Because the schema changes it not cascaded, only newer partitions would use the new schema and older partitions would still have old schema in Glue. Then when users use engines like Athena that's aware of partition-level schema to query Glue catalog it would seem the older partition is not readable due to failures described here: [Athena partition schema mismatch errors](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/updates-and-partitions.html)\r\n\r\nThis patch would specifically update partition info on Glue with Glue API if cascade is eligible in AwsGlueCatalogSyncClient\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nMinor performance impact on Glue sync tool as we need to sync partition info, but this has to be done to ensure correctness\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nCurrently, the operations in compaction and clustering procedure have different meanings. For example, compaction procedure only supports schedule and run (do both schedule and execute), execute only is not supported, which is very useful in asynchronous compaction, because we only want to execute plan generated by write task. \r\nAnd the actual meaning of the operation between them is not uniform too.\r\n\r\nIn order to make it convenient for users to use, standardize the operation of table management (compaction and clustering) in call procedure:\r\n\r\n- `schedule`: schedule a new plan\r\n- `execute`: if specific instants exist (set by `instants` param), execute them, otherwise execute all pending plans\r\n- `scheduleAndExecute`: schedule a new plan and then execute it, **if no plan is generated during schedule, execute all pending plans**\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nAbove\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n**Removed feature**:\r\n\r\n`call run_compaction(table => '$tableName', op => 'schedule', timestamp=> 'xxx')`\r\n\r\n It is not necessary to manually specify the schedule plan's timestamp, and **it can be dangerous because it may break the timeline**, so remove it.\r\n\r\n**Reserved feature:**\r\n\r\n`call run_compaction(table => '$tableName', op => 'schedule')`: schedule a new plan, **Recommended**\r\n\r\n`call run_compaction(table => '$tableName', op => 'run')`: **Not recommended**,  the function is the same as `call run_compaction(table => '$tableName', op => 'scheduleAndExecute')`\r\n\r\n`call run_compaction(table => '$tableName', op => 'run, timestamp=> 'xxx')`: **Not recommended**, the function is the same as `call run_compaction(table => '$tableName', op => 'execute', instants => 'xxx')`\r\n\r\n**New feature:**\r\n\r\n`call run_compaction(table => '$tableName', op => 'execute')`: execute all pending plans, **Recommended**\r\n\r\n`call run_compaction(table => '$tableName', op => 'execute', instants => 'xxx')`: execute specific plans, **Recommended**\r\n\r\n`call run_compaction(table => '$tableName', op => 'scheduleAndExecute')`: schedule a new plan and then execute it, if no plan is generated during schedule, execute all pending plans, **Recommended**\r\n\r\nNote that the above features are consistent with `call run_clustering` (the behavior of `call run_clustering` has not been changed in this PR)\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\n- Add a new `HoodieMergeOnReadSnapshotReader` that implements `Iterator<HoodieRecord>`. It merges the base Parquet data with Avro data in log files.\r\n- Add a test for the new reader.\r\n- This is used in https://github.com/codope/trino/commit/c744601d7b5ea08812ba174051312b7b894f14f5#diff-b55a3ef8348b943f46a40738421f333d68b880bf7817d7d513c6e4d1569154de\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nIt is a public API and can be used in query engines to execute Hudi MOR snapshot queries. It's an alternative to using RealtimeRecordReaders.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nJIRA: [HUDI-6451]. Randomly obtain a path in HoodieMemoryConfig#getDefaultSpillableMapBasePath.\r\n\r\nThe HoodieMemoryConfig#getDefaultSpillableMapBasePath method retrieves a path from YARN's LOCAL_DIRS environment variable. However, the order of LOCAL_DIRS concatenation in YARN is typically fixed, resulting in the DefaultSpillableMapBasePath being a fixed value. Considering the disk load perspective, we should randomize the selection of a path from the array.\r\n\r\nIn typical scenarios, YARN's NodeManager (NM) with five disks, namely `/nm1/localdir`, `/nm2/localdir`, `/nm3/localdir`, `/nm4/localdir`, and `/nm5/localdir`, would choose `/nm1/localdir` as the preferred option. \r\nWe should randomly choose a disk.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nThe disk selection strategy has been improved to ensure the availability of multiple disks.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nnone.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2023-06-27T16:06:04Z","updated_at":"2023-06-28T08:10:11Z","closed_at":"2023-06-28T08:10:10Z","merged_at":"2023-06-28T08:10:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"c76c5e3b527fc4f79edd09696021160c5041a241","assignee":{"login":"danny0405","id":7644508,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NDQ1MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7644508?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405","html_url":"https://github.com/danny0405","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"danny0405","id":7644508,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NDQ1MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7644508?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405","html_url":"https://github.com/danny0405","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2719846715,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE5ODQ2NzE1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/writer-core","name":"writer-core","color":"3F460E","default":false,"description":"Issues

Change Logs\r\n\r\n[HUDI-6446] Fixing MDT commit time parsing and RLI instantiation with MDT. \r\n\r\nFor a fresh table, when both FILES and RLI is enabled, we use default values for num file groups i.e 10 for RLI. and this also creates a log file and does not create a base file since there are no records to instantiate as such. So, we should defer the instantiation to later. either at the end of first commit or when the data table has atleast 1 completed commit. \r\n\r\nFor an already existing table, this is not an issue since if there are valid records, we will dynamically determine the number of file groups. \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nDeferring instantiation of RLI for a fresh table to later when we have atleast 1 completed commit in DT. \r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read

Change Logs\r\n\r\nSupport `delete_partition`, `insert_overwrite` and `insert_overwrite_table` with record-level index. The metadata records should be updated accordingly.\r\n\r\n- all records in the deleted partition(s) should be deleted from RLI (for `delete_partition` operation)\r\n- newly inserted records should be present in RLI\r\n- old records in the affected partitions should be removed from RLI\r\n- old records that happen to have the same record key as the new inserts won't be removed from RLI; their entries will be updated\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nRLI data integrity\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nMedium\r\n\r\n- [ ] UT, FT and e2e testing.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n###
