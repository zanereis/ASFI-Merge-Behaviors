What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe current implement of some DDL not unify the output and not pass the output properly to physical command.\r\nSuch as: The `ShowTables` output attributes `namespace`, but `ShowTablesCommand` output attributes `database`.\r\n\r\nAs the query plan, this PR pass the output attributes from `ShowTables` to `ShowTablesCommand`, `ShowTableExtended ` to `ShowTablesCommand`.\r\n\r\nTake `show tables` and `show table extended like 'tbl'` as example.\r\nThe output before this PR:\r\n`show tables`\r\n|database|tableName|isTemporary|\r\n-- | -- | --\r\n| default|      tbl|      false|\r\n\r\nIf catalog is v2 session catalog, the output before this PR:\r\n|namespace|tableName|\r\n-- | --\r\n| default|      tbl\r\n\r\n`show table extended like

the output of SHOW TABLES.\r\nSecond, pass the output attributes could keep the expr ID unchanged, so that avoid bugs when we apply more operators above the command output dataframe.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes.\r\nThe output schema of `SHOW TABLES` replace `database` by `namespace`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nJenkins test.\r\n","created_at":"2021-01-19T14:55:13Z","updated_at":"2021-02-08T13:21:14Z","closed_at":"2021-02-08T08:40:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0671d4061d1c6025c3832f94b1d6144bbdbf3d4f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31245/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31245/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31245/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/815d36b35c294d110cf0770d2f0850d9ae1da151","head":{"label":"beliefer:SPARK-34157","ref":"SPARK-34157","sha":"815d36b35c294d110cf0770d2f0850d9ae1da151","user":{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":237617513,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzc2MTc1MTM=","name":"spark","full_name":"beliefer/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n(1) Adds more refined pyspark exceptions.\r\n(2) Suggests a new ordering for exceptions in the project - Each module has its exceptions in a corresponding exceptions.py. For example the core module has its own exeptions.py (under pyspark/exceptions.py) seperated from the sql module's exceptions.py (under pyspark/sql/exceptions.py).\r\n\r\nOutline of added exceptions (all of them contained in pyspark root module):\r\n\r\n- NonDriverReferenceError\r\n- JavaGatewayError\r\n- SparkContextInitializationError\r\n     - SparkContextConfigurationError\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n(1) Needed for enabling users a better handling of various error scenarios and for clarity.\r\n(2) Enables a more clean way of managing the various exceptions and in each module and also allows for sharing a common exceptions between python files in the same module without risking circular dependencies.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\npe of exceptions thrown will be more refined and accurate, exception messages remaine unchanged and exceptions inherit from their former class of exception (be it Exception or RuntimeError) for backwards compatability.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTests are passing and tested manually that the right exception type is thrown in the various scenarios along with the appropriate exception messages. In order to fully automate the tests cleanly it's required to implement the same conversion mechanism found in CapturedException but I find it beyond the scope of this PR.\r\n","created_at":"2021-01-18T20:29:25Z","updated_at":"2021-05-26T02:54:47Z","closed_at":"2021-05-26T02:54:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"02881dcdf7579682d2a7222666bead685f95638a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1405803268,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAzMjY4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/MLLIB","name":"MLLIB","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFix table size parsing from the `Statistics` field which is formed at: https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/c3d81fbe79014f693cf93c02e31af401727761d7/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/catalog/interface.scala#L573 . Before the fix, `getTableSize()` returns only the last digit. This works for Hive table in the tests because its size < 10 bytes, and accidentally works for V1 In-Memory catalog table in the tests. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis makes tests more reliable. For example, the parsing can not work in `AlterTableDropPartitionSuite` when table size before partition dropping:\r\n```\r\n+---------+\r\n|data_type|\r\n+---------+\r\n|878 bytes|\r\n+---------+\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n```\r\n+---------+\r\n|data_type|\r\n+---------+\r\n|439 bytes|\r\n+---------+\r\n```\r\nat:\r\n```scala\r\n        val onePartSize = getTableSize(t)\r\n        assert(0 < onePartSize && onePartSize < twoPartSize)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy existing test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive-2.3 -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly *.AlterTableAddPartitionSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive-2.3 -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly

RECOVER PARTITIONS`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis fixes the issues portrayed by the example:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> create table tbl (col int, part int) using parquet partitioned by (part);\r\nspark-sql> insert into tbl partition (part=0) select 0;\r\nspark-sql> cache table tbl;\r\nspark-sql> select * from tbl;\r\n0\t0\r\nspark-sql> show table extended like 'tbl' partition(part=0);\r\ndefault\ttbl\tfalse\tPartition Values: [part=0]\r\nLocation: file:/Users/maximgekk/proj/recover-partitions-refresh-cache/spark-warehouse/tbl/part=0\r\n...\r\n```\r\nCreate new partition by copying the existing one:\r\n```\r\n$ cp -r /Users/maximgekk/proj/recover-partitions-refresh-cache/spark-warehouse/tbl/part=0 /Users/maximgekk/proj/recover-partitions-refresh-cache/spark-warehouse/tbl/part=1\r\n```\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> alter table tbl recover partitions;\r\nspark-sql> select * from tbl;\r\n0\t0\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe last query must return `0\t1` since it has been recovered by `ALTER TABLE .. RECOVER PARTITIONS`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. After the changes for the example above:\r\n```sql\r\n...\r\nspark-sql> alter table tbl recover partitions;\r\nspark-sql> select * from tbl;\r\n0\t0\r\n0\t1\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the affected test suite:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive-2.3 -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly *CachedTableSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly *HiveSchemaInferenceSuite\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nAuthored-by: Max Gekk <max.gekk@gmail.com>\r\nSigned-off-by: Wenchen Fan <wenchen@databricks.com>\r\n(cherry picked from commit

RECOVER PARTITIONS`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis fixes the issues portrayed by the example:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> create table tbl (col int, part int) using parquet partitioned by (part);\r\nspark-sql> insert into tbl partition (part=0) select 0;\r\nspark-sql> cache table tbl;\r\nspark-sql> select * from tbl;\r\n0\t0\r\nspark-sql> show table extended like 'tbl' partition(part=0);\r\ndefault\ttbl\tfalse\tPartition Values: [part=0]\r\nLocation: file:/Users/maximgekk/proj/recover-partitions-refresh-cache/spark-warehouse/tbl/part=0\r\n...\r\n```\r\nCreate new partition by copying the existing one:\r\n```\r\n$ cp -r /Users/maximgekk/proj/recover-partitions-refresh-cache/spark-warehouse/tbl/part=0 /Users/maximgekk/proj/recover-partitions-refresh-cache/spark-warehouse/tbl/part=1\r\n```\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> alter table tbl recover partitions;\r\nspark-sql> select * from tbl;\r\n0\t0\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe last query must return `0\t1` since it has been recovered by `ALTER TABLE .. RECOVER PARTITIONS`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. After the changes for the example above:\r\n```sql\r\n...\r\nspark-sql> alter table tbl recover partitions;\r\nspark-sql> select * from tbl;\r\n0\t0\r\n0\t1\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the affected test suite:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive-2.3 -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly *CachedTableSuite\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nAuthored-by: Max Gekk

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n`java.io.FIle.toURL` method does not automatically escape characters that are illegal in URLs. \r\n\r\nJava doc recommended that new code convert an abstract pathname into a URL by first converting it into a URI, via the `toURI` method, and then converting the URI into a URL via the `URI.toURL` method.\r\n\r\nSo this pr cleaned up the relevant cases in Spark code.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCleaning up `@Deprecated` Java API usage.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass the Jenkins or GitHub

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is a followup of #27433. It fixes the naming to match with Scala side, and this is similar with https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/31062.\r\n\r\nNote that:\r\n\r\n- there are a bit of inconsistency already e.g.) `x`, `y` in SparkR and they are documented together for doc deduplication. This part I did not change but the name `zero` vs `initialValue` looks unnecessary.\r\n- such naming matching seems already pretty common in SparkR.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo make the usage similar with Scala side, and for consistency.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, this is not released yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nGitHub Actions and Jenkins build will test it out.\r\n\r\nAlso, I manually tested:\r\n\r\n```r\r\n> df <- select(createDataFrame(data.frame(id = 1)),expr(\"CAST(array(1.0, 2.0, -3.0,

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR keeps partitioning of input tables in TPCDSQueryBenchmark when `--cbo` option is enabled.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/31011 introduced the `--cbo` option but unfortunately in that mode the table partitioning of the input data is lost. This means that the results of CBO mode is very different to non CBO mode, one example is that Dynamic Partition Pruning doesn't kick in in CBO mode.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo monitor performance changed with CBO enabled.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManually

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAlign schema pattern \"*\" behavior with HiveServer2\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n`HiveServer2` treat schema pattern \"\\*\" as list all databases, but `SparkThriftServer` return an exception since \"*\" is an invalid regex.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/hive/blob/f1e87137034e4ecbe39a859d4ef44319800016d7/metastore/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/metastore/ObjectStore.java#L827\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, now schema pattern \"*\" is valid and has same behavior with empty string in `MetadataOperation` such as `GetSchemasOperation`, `GetTablesOperation`, `GetFunctionsOperation`, `GetColumnsOperation` rather than throw `Exception`\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nUT\r\n","created_at":"2021-01-17T17:15:17Z","updated_at":"2021-07-30T00:07:58Z","closed_at":"2021-07-30T00:07:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"28131d4aea0810ff33f7335e4796c1afa97d1745","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31217/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31217/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31217/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8d5c62870fa8c3ea5798f63affeba12d6f675074","head":{"label":"pan3793:SPARK-34146","ref":"SPARK-34146","sha":"8d5c62870fa8c3ea5798f63affeba12d6f675074","user":{"login":"pan3793","id":26535726,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTM1NzI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26535726?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793","html_url":"https://github.com/pan3793","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":275650396,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzU2NTAzOTY=","name":"spark","full_name":"pan3793/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"pan3793","id":26535726,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTM1NzI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26535726?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793","html_url":"https://github.com/pan3793","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pan3793/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/pan3793/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhile adding new partition to v2 `InMemoryAtomicPartitionTable`/`InMemoryPartitionTable`, add single row to the table content when the table is fully partitioned.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe `ALTER TABLE .. ADD PARTITION` command does not change content of fully partitioned v2 table. For instance, `INSERT INTO` changes table content:\r\n```scala\r\n      sql(s\"CREATE TABLE t (p0 INT, p1 STRING) USING _ PARTITIONED BY (p0, p1)\")\r\n      sql(s\"INSERT INTO t SELECT 1, 'def'\")\r\n      sql(s\"SELECT * FROM t\").show(false)\r\n\r\n+---+---+\r\n|p0 |p1 |\r\n+---+---+\r\n|1  |def|\r\n+---+---+\r\n```\r\nbut `ALTER TABLE .. ADD PARTITION` doesn't change v2 table content:\r\n```scala\r\n      sql(s\"ALTER TABLE t ADD PARTITION (p0 = 0, p1 = 'abc')\")\r\n      sql(s\"SELECT * FROM t\").show(false)\r\n\r\n+---+---+\r\n|p0 |p1 |\r\n+---+---+\r\n+---+---+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, the changes impact only on tests but for the example above in tests:\r\n```scala\r\n      sql(s\"ALTER TABLE t ADD PARTITION (p0 = 0, p1 = 'abc')\")\r\n      sql(s\"SELECT * FROM t\").show(false)\r\n\r\n+---+---+\r\n|p0 |p1 |\r\n+---+---+\r\n|0  |abc|\r\n+---+---+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the unified tests for `ALTER TABLE .. ADD PARTITION`.","created_at":"2021-01-17T10:29:15Z","updated_at":"2021-01-19T19:07:04Z","closed_at":"2021-01-19T05:41:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6b5c3a5aea62d1af3f4ad7e8b7f748cf0ef9468e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31216/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31216/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31216/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2502fb41f9cb334640ad976ebb72c9f790214f4f","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:add-partition-by-all-columns","ref":"add-partition-by-all-columns","sha":"2502fb41f9cb334640ad976ebb72c9f790214f4f","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nRewrote one `ExtractGenerator` case such that it would not rely on a side effect of the flatmap function.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nWith the dataframe api it is possible to have a lazy sequence as the `output` of a `LogicalPlan`. When exploding a column on this dataframe using the `withColumn(\"newName\", explode(col(\"name\")))` method, the `ExtractGenerator` does not extract the generator and `CheckAnalysis` would throw an exception.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nBugfix\r\nBefore this, the work around was to put `.select(\"*\")` before the explode.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nUT","created_at":"2021-01-17T00:08:55Z","updated_at":"2021-04-06T06:18:21Z","closed_at":"2021-02-06T19:27:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6db5fcf8379da7a539cd49df017cf0e228010605","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31213/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31213/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31213/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/82ca8f528eae0ce960f26fc6fd5a10601afa3723","head":{"label":"tanelk:SPARK-34141_extract_generator","ref":"SPARK-34141_extract_generator","sha":"82ca8f528eae0ce960f26fc6fd5a10601afa3723","user":{"login":"tanelk","id":3342974,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDI5NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3342974?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanelk","html_url":"https://github.com/tanelk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanelk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanelk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanelk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanelk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanelk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanelk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanelk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanelk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanelk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":279394019,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzkzOTQwMTk=","name":"spark","full_name":"tanelk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tanelk","id":3342974,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDI5NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3342974?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanelk","html_url":"https://github.com/tanelk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanelk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanelk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanelk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanelk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanelk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanelk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanelk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanelk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tanelk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tanelk/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR extends `pyspark.sql.functions.lit` to support complex literals:\r\n\r\n- `list` mapped to SQL `array`.\r\n- `dict` mapped to SQL `map`.\r\n- `tuple` mapped to `struct` (with support for capturing names from `namedtuple` and `Row`)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently Python uses have to quite verbose constructs to create complex literals, i.e.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import array, lit\r\n\r\nxs = [1, 2, 3]\r\narray(*[lit(x) for x in xs])\r\n```\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import create_map, lit, map_from_arrays\r\nfrom itertools import chain\r\n\r\nkvs = {\"a\": 1, \"b\": 2}\r\n\r\ncreate_map(*chain.from_iterable(\r\n    (lit(k), lit(v)) for k, v in kvs.items()\r\n))\r\n\r\n# or\r\n\r\nmap_from_arrays(\r\n    array(*[lit(k) for k in kvs.keys()]),\r\n    array(*[lit(v) for v in kvs.values()])\r\n)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn contrast, such literals can be created in Scala using `typedLit`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes. It is merged users will be able to create complex literals directly with `lit`, i.e.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nlit({\"a\": 1, \"b\": 2})\r\nlit([\"foo\", \"bar\"])\r\nlit((1, (\"a\", True)))\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNew unit tests.\r\n","created_at":"2021-01-16T14:50:51Z","updated_at":"2021-06-14T00:07:59Z","closed_at":"2021-06-14T00:07:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5f9ab4365f60622e0bd3ce95d915163b1491254f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31207/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31207/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31207/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/dade2b17152baf3f02553060bc8bbdbf96744756","head":{"label":"zero323:SPARK-34136","ref":"SPARK-34136","sha":"dade2b17152baf3f02553060bc8bbdbf96744756","user":{"login":"zero323","id":1554276,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTQyNzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1554276?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323","html_url":"https://github.com/zero323","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":43824676,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MzgyNDY3Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"zero323/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zero323","id":1554276,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTQyNzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1554276?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323","html_url":"https://github.com/zero323","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zero323/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zero323/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR changes cache refreshing of v1 tables in v1 commands. In particular, v1 table dependents are not removed from the cache after this PR. Comparing to current implementation, we just clear cached data of all dependents and keep them in the cache. So, the next actions will fill in the cached data of the original v1 table and its dependents. In more details:\r\n1. Modified the `CatalogImpl.refreshTable()` method to use `recacheByPlan()` instead of `lookupCachedData()`, `uncacheQuery()` and `cacheQuery()`. Users can call this method via public API like `spark.catalog.refreshTable()`.\r\n2. Rewritten the part in `CatalogImpl.refreshTable()` which was responsible for table meta-data refreshing because this code stopped to work properly after removing of the second `sparkSession.table(tableIdent)`.\r\n3. Added new private method `invalidateCachedTable()` to `SessionCatalog`. Comparing to the existing `SessionCatalog.refreshTable`, it invalidates the relation cache only. If we called `SessionCatalog.refreshTable` from `CatalogImpl.refreshTable()`, we would refresh temporary and global temporary views twice (that could lead to refreshing file index twice).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. This should improve user experience with table/view caching. For example, let's imagine that an user has cached v1 table and cached view based on the table. And the user passed the table to external library which drops/renames/adds partitions in the v1 table. Unfortunately, the user gets the view uncached after that even he/she hasn't uncached the view explicitly. \r\n2. To improve code maintenance.\r\n3. To reduce the amount of calls to Hive external catalog.\r\n4. Also this should speed up table recaching. \r\n5. To have the same behavior as for v2 tables supported by https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/31172\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nFrom the view of the correctness of query results, there are no behavior changes but the changes might influence on consuming memory and query execution time. For example:\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```scala\r\nscala> sql(\"CREATE TABLE tbl (c int)\")\r\nscala> sql(\"CACHE TABLE tbl\")\r\nscala> sql(\"CREATE VIEW v AS SELECT * FROM tbl\")\r\nscala> sql(\"CACHE TABLE v\")\r\n\r\nscala> spark.catalog.isCached(\"v\")\r\nres6: Boolean = true\r\nscala> spark.catalog.refreshTable(\"tbl\")\r\n\r\nscala> spark.catalog.isCached(\"v\")\r\nres8: Boolean = false\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n```scala\r\nscala> spark.catalog.refreshTable(\"tbl\")\r\n\r\nscala> spark.catalog.isCached(\"v\")\r\nres8: Boolean = true\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n1. Added new unit tests that create a view, a temporary view and a global temporary view on top of v1/v2 tables, and refresh the base table via `ALTER TABLE .. ADD/DROP/RENAME PARTITION`.\r\n2. By running the unified test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive-2.3 -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly *AlterTableAddPartitionSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive-2.3 -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly *AlterTableDropPartitionSuite\"\r\n# build/sbt -Phive-2.3 -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly *AlterTableRenamePartitionSuite\"\r\n```","created_at":"2021-01-16T12:44:24Z","updated_at":"2021-01-21T20:26:22Z","closed_at":"2021-01-21T13:03:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f4cc69e994eb68f70dbed901a90a995737f95438","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31206/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31206/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31206/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/357c69f888ed4f27ea8db3b78d79d123b4dac019","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:refreshTable-recache-by-plan","ref":"refreshTable-recache-by-plan","sha":"357c69f888ed4f27ea8db3b78d79d123b4dac019","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis pr keep necessary stats after partition pruning.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nImprove query performance. It will push down aggregate since SPARK-34081 because it can be planed as BroadcastHashJoin. But it lacks column statistics after [`PruneFileSourcePartitions`](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/d0c83f372b1aa87327eacc16b131c57fccf6c205/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/datasources/PruneFileSourcePartitions.scala#L102-L103). Therefore, it will eventually be planned as SortMergeJoin.\r\n\r\nPlease see the log:\r\n```\r\njoin.right.stats: org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.optimizer.PushDownPredicates: Statistics(sizeInBytes=348.8 KiB, rowCount=1.79E+4)\r\njoin.right.stats: org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.PruneFileSourcePartitions: Statistics(sizeInBytes=1414.2 EiB)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit test and benchmark test\r\n\r\n\r\nSQL | Before this PR(Seconds) | After this PR(Seconds)\r\n--

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n1. Add back Maven enforcer for duplicate dependencies check\r\n2. More strict check on Hadoop versions which support shaded client in `IsolatedClientLoader`. To do proper version check, this adds a util function `majorMinorPatchVersion` to extract major/minor/patch version from a string.\r\n3. Cleanup unnecessary code\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe Maven enforcer was removed as part of #30556. This proposes to add it back. \r\n\r\nAlso, Hadoop shaded client doesn't work in certain cases (see [these comments](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/30701#discussion_r558522227) for details). This strictly checks that the current Hadoop version (i.e., 3.2.2 at the moment) has good support of shaded client or otherwise fallback to old unshaded ones.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nMake the field name matching between Avro and Catalyst schemas, on both the reader and writer paths, respect the global SQL settings for case sensitivity (i.e. case-insensitive by default). `AvroSerializer` and `AvroDeserializer` share a common utility in `AvroUtils` to search for an Avro field to match a given Catalyst field.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSpark SQL is normally case-insensitive (by default), but currently when `AvroSerializer` and `AvroDeserializer` perform matching between Catalyst schemas and Avro schemas, the matching is done in a case-sensitive manner. So for example the following will fail:\r\n```scala\r\n      val avroSchema =\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n          |{\r\n          |  \"type\" : \"record\",\r\n          |  \"name\" : \"test_schema\",\r\n          |  \"fields\" : [\r\n          |    {\"name\": \"foo\", \"type\": \"int\"},\r\n          |    {\"name\": \"BAR\", \"type\": \"int\"}\r\n          |  ]\r\n          |}\r\n      \"\"\".stripMargin\r\n      val df = Seq((1, 3), (2, 4)).toDF(\"FOO\", \"bar\")\r\n\r\n      df.write.option(\"avroSchema\", avroSchema).format(\"avro\").save(savePath)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe same is true on the read path, if we assume `testAvro` has been written using the schema above, the below will fail to match the fields:\r\n```scala\r\ndf.read.schema(new StructType().add(\"FOO\", IntegerType).add(\"bar\", IntegerType))\r\n  .format(\"avro\").load(testAvro)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nWhen reading Avro data, or writing Avro data using the `avroSchema` option, field matching will be performed with case sensitivity respecting the global SQL settings.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew tests added to `AvroSuite` to validate the case sensitivity logic in an end-to-end manner through the SQL engine.","created_at":"2021-01-15T22:42:36Z","updated_at":"2021-01-25T17:47:29Z","closed_at":"2021-01-25T04:55:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7d491734793dde0f6c628ba380653c55a7f2ed8c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1988040187,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTg4MDQwMTg3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/AVRO","name":"AVRO","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31201/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31201/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31201/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d919613197115bf08a8b0be15577df3a595d66b7","head":{"label":"xkrogen:xkrogen-SPARK-34133-avro-serde-casesensitivity-errormessages","ref":"xkrogen-SPARK-34133-avro-serde-casesensitivity-errormessages","sha":"d919613197115bf08a8b0be15577df3a595d66b7","user":{"login":"xkrogen","id":6570401,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NzA0MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6570401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen","html_url":"https://github.com/xkrogen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":273605257,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzM2MDUyNTc=","name":"spark","full_name":"xkrogen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xkrogen","id":6570401,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NzA0MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6570401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen","html_url":"https://github.com/xkrogen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xkrogen/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nMissing POD detection is extended by timestamp (and time limit) based check to avoid wrongfully detection of missing POD detection.\r\n\r\nThe two new timestamps:\r\n- `fullSnapshotTs` is introduced for the `ExecutorPodsSnapshot` which only updated by the pod polling snapshot source\r\n- `registrationTs` is introduced for the `ExecutorData` and it is initialized at the executor registration at the scheduler backend\r\n\r\nMoreover a new config `spark.kubernetes.executor.missingPodDetectDelta` is used to specify the accepted delta between the two.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWatching a POD (`ExecutorPodsWatchSnapshotSource`) only inform about single POD changes. This could wrongfully lead to detecting of missing PODs (PODs known by scheduler backend but missing from POD snapshots) by the executor POD lifecycle manager.\r\n\r\nA key indicator of this error is seeing this log message:\r\n\r\n> \"The executor with ID [some_id] was not found in the cluster but we didn't get a reason why. Marking the executor as failed. The executor may have been deleted but the driver missed the deletion event.\"\r\n\r\nSo one of the problem is running the missing POD detection check even when a single POD is changed without having a full consistent snapshot about all the PODs (see `ExecutorPodsPollingSnapshotSource`).\r\nThe other problem could be the race between the executor POD lifecycle manager and the scheduler backend: so even in case of a having a full snapshot the registration at the scheduler backend could precede the snapshot polling (and processing of those polled snapshots).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. When the POD is missing then the reason message explaining the executor's exit is extended with both timestamps (the polling time and the executor registration time) and even the new config is mentioned.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe existing unit tests are extended.\r\n\r\n(cherry picked from commit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr use `exists` or `forall` to simplify `filter + emptiness check`, it's semantically consistent, but looks simpler. The rule as follow:\r\n\r\n- `seq.filter(p).size == 0)` -> `!seq.exists(p)`\r\n- `seq.filter(p).length > 0` -> `seq.exists(p)`\r\n- `seq.filterNot(p).isEmpty` -> `seq.forall(p)`\r\n- `seq.filterNot(p).nonEmpty` -> `!seq.forall(p)`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCode Simpilefications.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass the Jenkins or GitHub

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nDisplay history server entries using datatables instead of Mustache + Datatables which proved to be faster and non-blocking for the webpage while searching (using search bar in the page)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSmall changes in the attempts (entries) and removed part of HTML (Mustache template).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNot very sure, but it's not supposed to change the way the page looks rather it changes how entries are displayed.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nRunning test, since it's not adding new functionality.\r\n","created_at":"2021-01-15T06:08:52Z","updated_at":"2021-01-17T20:39:00Z","closed_at":"2021-01-17T20:37:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"29159dce9397bc98be3d4317866c409006dd785b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605079,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDc5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/WEB%20UI","name":"WEB

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to pull the test of `numKeys` metric into a separate test in `StateStoreSuite`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nRight now in `StateStoreSuite`, the tests of get/put/remove/commit are mixed with `numKeys` metric test. I found it is flaky when I was testing with other `StateStore` implementation.\r\n\r\nCurrent test logic is tightly bound to the in-memory map behavior of `HDFSBackedStateStore`. For example, put can immediately show up in the `numKeys` metric.\r\n\r\nBut for a `StateStore` implementation relying on external storage, e.g. RocksDB, the metric might be updated once the data is actually committed. And `StateStoreSuite` should be a common test suite for all kinds of StateStore implementations.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, we also are able to check these metrics after state store is updated (committed). So I think we can refactor the test a little bit to make it easier to incorporate other `StateStore` externally.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo, dev only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnit test.\r\n","created_at":"2021-01-14T18:19:05Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:24:39Z","closed_at":"2021-01-14T23:03:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"14dc7122c10be707d2768419895fb79cd1644e02","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis adds a few test cases for looking up cached temporary/permanent view created using clauses such as `ORDER BY` or `LIMIT`. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nDue to `EliminateView` and how canonization is done for `View`, which inserts an extra project operator, cache lookup could fail in the following simple example:\r\n```sql\r\n> CREATE TABLE t (key bigint, value string) USING parquet\r\n> CACHE TABLE v1 AS SELECT * FROM t ORDER BY key\r\n> SELECT * FROM t ORDER BY key\r\n```\r\n\r\n#31368 addresses this issue by removing the project operator if `canRemoveProject` check is successful. This PR adds a few tests.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNO\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR just adds unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAs described in SPARK-33557, `HeartbeatReceiver` and `MesosCoarseGrainedSchedulerBackend` will always use `Network.NETWORK_TIMEOUT.defaultValueString` as value of `STORAGE_BLOCKMANAGER_HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT` when we configure `NETWORK_TIMEOUT` without configure `STORAGE_BLOCKMANAGER_HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT`, this is different from the relationship described in `configuration.md`.\r\n\r\nTo fix this problem，the main change of this pr as follow:\r\n\r\n- Remove the explicitly default value of `STORAGE_BLOCKMANAGER_HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT`\r\n\r\n- Use actual value of `NETWORK_TIMEOUT` as `STORAGE_BLOCKMANAGER_HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT` when `STORAGE_BLOCKMANAGER_HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT` not configured in `HeartbeatReceiver` and `MesosCoarseGrainedSchedulerBackend` \r\n \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo ensure the relationship between `NETWORK_TIMEOUT` and

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR introduces a new property `spark.sql.cli.print.header` to let users change the behavior of printing header for spark-sql CLI by SET command.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nLike Hive CLI, spark-sql CLI accepts `hive.cli.print.header` property and we can change the behavior of printing header.\r\nBut spark-sql CLI doesn't allow users to change Hive specific configurations dynamically by SET command.\r\nSo, it's better to support the way to change the behavior by SET command.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. Users can dynamically change the behavior by SET command.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nI confirmed with the following commands/queries.\r\n```\r\nspark-sql> select (1) as a, (2) as b, (3) as c, (4) as

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR changes cache refreshing of v2 tables in v2 commands. In particular, v2 table dependents are not removed from the cache after this PR. Comparing to current implementation, we just clear cached data of all dependents and keep them in the cache. So, the next actions will fill in the cached data of the original v2 table and its dependents. In more details:\r\n\r\n1. Add new method `recacheTable()` to `DataSourceV2Strategy` and pass it the exec node where need to recache table. New method uses `recacheByPlan` to refresh data cache of v2 tables, and keeps table dependents still cached **while clearing their caches**.\r\n2. Simplify `invalidateCache` (and rename it `invalidateTableCache`) by retargeting it for only table cache invalidation.\r\n3. Modify a test for `REFRESH TABLE` and check that v2 table dependent is still cached after refreshing the base table.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. This should improve user experience with table/view caching. For example, let's imagine that an user has cached v2 table and cached view based on the table. And the user passed the table to external library which drops/renames/adds partitions in the v2 table. Unfortunately, the user gets the view uncached after that even he/she hasn't uncached the view explicitly. \r\n2. Improve code maintenance.\r\n3. Reduce the number of calls to the Cache Manager when need to recache a table. Before the changes, `invalidateCache()` invokes the Cache Manager 3 times: `lookupCachedData()`, `uncacheQuery()` and `cacheQuery()`.\r\n4. Also this should speed up table recaching. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nFrom the view of the correctness of query results, there are no behavior changes but the changes might influence on consuming memory and query execution time.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the existing test suites for v2 the add/drop/rename partition commands.","created_at":"2021-01-13T15:25:40Z","updated_at":"2021-01-15T03:33:01Z","closed_at":"2021-01-15T03:33:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4b40ec91e720064af37aef2574d2e5557c6bf72b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31172/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31172/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31172/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f4415ebe42443ce4127aebf4f83cf3f93ec531b2","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:dsv2-recache-table","ref":"dsv2-recache-table","sha":"f4415ebe42443ce4127aebf4f83cf3f93ec531b2","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn AdaptiveSparkPlanExec.getFinalPhysicalPlan, when newStages are generated, materialize BroadcastQueryStage first and wait the materialization finish before materialize other (ShuffleQueryStage) stages.\r\nIt can make sure the broadcast job are scheduled and finished before map jobs to avoid waiting for job schedule and cause broadcast timeout. This is the same behavior with non-AQE queries.\r\nActually, we want to only control the schedule for broadcast job is before map jobs. However, it is difficult to control and may have large changes to spark-core. So the trade off is wait broadcast job finish before materialize ShuffleQueryStage.\r\n\r\nConsider the case, a is a large table, b and c are very small in-memory dimension tables.\r\n```\r\nSELECT a.id, a.name, b.name, c.name, count(a.value) \r\nFROM a \r\nJOIN b on a.id = b.id \r\nJOIN c on a.name = c.name \r\nGROUP BY a.id, a.name\r\n```\r\nFor non-AQE: \r\n1. run collect b, then broadcast b \r\n2. run collect c, then broadcast c\r\n3. submit job which contains 2 stage\r\n\r\nFor current AQE: \r\n1. submit 3 job( shuffle map stage for a, collect b and broadcast b, collect c broadcast c ) almost at the same time\r\n2. when all finished, run result stage\r\n\r\nFor AQE with this PR:\r\n1. submit 2 job(collect b and broadcast b, collect c broadcast c) at the same time\r\n2. wait broadcast of b and c finish\r\n3. run shuffle map stage\r\n2. run result stage\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn non-AQE, we always wait the broadcast finish before submit shuffle map tasks.\r\n\r\nWhen enable AQE, in getFinalPhysicalPlan, spark traversal the physical plan bottom up and create query stage for materialized part by createQueryStages and materialize those new created query stages to submit map stages or broadcasting. When ShuffleQueryStage are materializing before BroadcastQueryStage, the map stage(job) and broadcast job are submitted almost at the same time, but map stage will hold all the computing resources. If the map stage runs slow (when lots of data needs to process and the resource is limited), the broadcast job cannot be started(and finished) before spark.sql.broadcastTimeout, thus cause whole job failed (introduced in SPARK-31475).\r\n\r\nThe workaround to increase spark.sql.broadcastTimeout doesn't make sense and graceful, because the data to broadcast is very small.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/30998 give a solution by sort the new stages by class type to make sure the calling of materialize() for BroadcastQueryState precede others. However, the solution is not perfect and because of the flaky of UT, it is revered. The order of calling materialize can guarantee that the order of task to be scheduled in normal circumstances, but, the guarantee is not strict since the submit of broadcast job and shuffle map job are in different thread.\r\n1. for broadcast job, call doPrepare() in main thread, and then start the real materialization in \"broadcast-exchange-0\" thread pool: calling getByteArrayRdd().collect() to submit collect job\r\n2. for shuffle map job, call ShuffleExchangeExec.mapOutputStatisticsFuture() which call sparkContext.submitMapStage() directly in main thread to submit map stage\r\n\r\n1 is trigger before 2, so in normal cases, the broadcast job will be submit first.\r\nHowever, we can not control how fast the two thread runs, so the \"broadcast-exchange-0\" thread could run a little bit slower than main thread, result in map stage submit first So there's still risk for the shuffle map job schedule earlier before broadcast job.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNO\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n1. Add UT\r\n2.

ADD PARTITION` which happens when:\r\n- A table doesn't have stats\r\n- `spark.sql.statistics.size.autoUpdate.enabled` is `true`\r\n\r\nIn that case, `ALTER TABLE .. ADD PARTITION` does not update table stats automatically.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe changes fix the issue demonstrated by the example:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> create table tbl (col0 int, part int) partitioned by (part);\r\nspark-sql> insert into tbl partition (part = 0) select 0;\r\nspark-sql> set spark.sql.statistics.size.autoUpdate.enabled=true;\r\nspark-sql> alter table tbl add partition (part = 1);\r\n```\r\nthe `add partition` command should update table stats but it does not. There are no stats in the output of:\r\n```\r\nspark-sql> describe table extended tbl;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. After the changes, `ALTER TABLE .. ADD PARTITION` updates stats even when a table doesn't have stats before the command:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> alter table tbl add partition (part = 1);\r\nspark-sql> describe table extended tbl;\r\ncol0\tint\tNULL\r\npart\tint\tNULL\r\n# Partition Information\r\n# col_name\tdata_type\tcomment\r\npart\tint\tNULL\r\n\r\n# Detailed Table Information\r\n...\r\nStatistics\t2 bytes\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running new UT and existing test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive-2.3 -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly *.StatisticsSuite\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nAuthored-by: Max Gekk <max.gekk@gmail.com>\r\nSigned-off-by: Wenchen Fan <wenchen@databricks.com>\r\n(cherry picked from commit

ADD PARTITION` which happens when:\r\n- A table doesn't have stats\r\n- `spark.sql.statistics.size.autoUpdate.enabled` is `true`\r\n\r\nIn that case, `ALTER TABLE .. ADD PARTITION` does not update table stats automatically.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe changes fix the issue demonstrated by the example:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> create table tbl (col0 int, part int) partitioned by (part);\r\nspark-sql> insert into tbl partition (part = 0) select 0;\r\nspark-sql> set spark.sql.statistics.size.autoUpdate.enabled=true;\r\nspark-sql> alter table tbl add partition (part = 1);\r\n```\r\nthe `add partition` command should update table stats but it does not. There are no stats in the output of:\r\n```\r\nspark-sql> describe table extended tbl;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. After the changes, `ALTER TABLE .. ADD PARTITION` updates stats even when a table doesn't have stats before the command:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> alter table tbl add partition (part = 1);\r\nspark-sql> describe table extended tbl;\r\ncol0\tint\tNULL\r\npart\tint\tNULL\r\n# Partition Information\r\n# col_name\tdata_type\tcomment\r\npart\tint\tNULL\r\n\r\n# Detailed Table Information\r\n...\r\nStatistics\t2 bytes\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running new UT and existing test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive-2.3 -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly *.StatisticsSuite\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nAuthored-by: Max Gekk <max.gekk@gmail.com>\r\nSigned-off-by: Wenchen Fan <wenchen@databricks.com>\r\n(cherry picked from commit 6c047958f9fcf4cac848695915deea289c65ddc1)\r\nSigned-off-by: Max Gekk

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFix the setting issue of shuffle batch fetch in `ShuffledRowRDD`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently, we can not disable the shuffle batch fetch mode once the batch fetch mode has been enabled. This PR fixes the issue to make `ShuffledRowRDD` respects the `spark.sql.adaptive.fetchShuffleBlocksInBatch` at runtime.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes. Before this PR, users can not disable batch fetch if they enabled first. After this PR, they can.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n`HadoopDelegationTokenManager.isServiceEnabled` is quite a time consuming operation which is called in `KafkaTokenUtil.needTokenUpdate` often which slowed down Kafka processing heavily. SPARK-33635 changed the if condition in order to overcome this issue when no delegation token is used but in case of delegation token usage the problem still exists. In this PR I'm caching the `HadoopDelegationTokenManager.isServiceEnabled` result in the `KafkaDataConsumer` instances which solves the issue. There would be another solution, namely caching the result inside `HadoopDelegationTokenManager` but since it's an object function and several application is running inside a JVM, different `SparkConf` instances will arrive. Caching the result per `SparkConf` instance would be an overkill.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nKafka stream processing is slow with delegation token.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n* Existing unit tests\r\n* In Kafka to Kafka live query I've double checked that `HadoopDelegationTokenManager.isServiceEnabled` call executed only when new `KafkaDataConsumer` created (new delegation token arrives or task failure).\r\n","created_at":"2021-01-12T13:36:56Z","updated_at":"2021-01-21T14:15:41Z","closed_at":"2021-01-13T02:05:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bb73a177ede61e1b8ec7156e617636e7728c20a2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUpdate to CI cancel policy to skip direct pushes. Duplicates will only be cancelled for Pull Requests.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n[Apparenlty](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/31104#issuecomment-758318463) the aggressive behavior of the cancel action which also cancels duplicate master builds is too agressive for spark community. This change spares merges to master and scheduled builds from duplicate checking (as a result all merges to master will be always build to completion). \r\n\r\nThe previous behavior of the action was that in case of subsequent merges to master, only the latest one was guaranteed to complete. Other changes could be cancelled before they complete to save job queue.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo, except if the master builds were somehow facing the users (but it's unlikely taking into account the ASF release policy).\r\nThere was a potential that some changes that could be detected by specific master merge failing could be detected later (in one of the subsequent builds) which could make investigation of the root cause of failure a bit more difficult, because it could have been introduced in one of the commits between two completed builds merges. But this is at most impacting the timeline of release close to release itself, not the release itself.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis configuration parameter has been tested earlier in Airflow. We used it initially, but since our master builds are heavy and we have extensive tests in the PRs and investigation for failed builds is not as difficult we found that limiting the strain on Github Action and cancelling master builds was more important for the health of the whole ASF community and we removed that configuration.\r\n\r\nTested in https://github.com/potiuk/spark/runs/1688506527?check_suite_focus=true#step:2:46 where the action found other master builds in progress but did not add them as candidates to

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the `HybridRowQueue ` to respect the configured memory mode.\r\n\r\nBesides, this PR also refactored the constructor of `MemoryConsumer` to accept the memory mode explicitly.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n`HybridRowQueue` supports both onHeap and offHeap manipulation. But it inherited the wrong `MemoryConsumer` constructor, which hard-coded the memory mode to `onHeap`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo. (Maybe yes in some cases where users can't complete the job before could complete successfully after the fix because of `HybridRowQueue` is able to spill under offHeap mode now. )\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUpdated the existing test to make it test both offHeap and onHeap

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR supposes to rename all decommission configurations to use the same namespace \"spark.decommission.*\".\r\n\r\nBesides, it also refines the config \"spark.decommission.storage.fallbackStorage.path\" to \"spark.decommission.storage.fallbackStoragePath\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently, decommission configurations are using difference namespaces, e.g., \r\n\r\n```scala\r\nspark.decommission.*\r\nspark.storage.decommission.*\r\nspark.executor.decommission.*\r\n```\r\nwhich may introduce unnecessary overhead for end-users. It's better to keep them under the same namespace. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo, since Spark 3.1 hasn't officially released.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nPass existing

ADD PARTITION` which happens when:\r\n- A table doesn't have stats\r\n- `spark.sql.statistics.size.autoUpdate.enabled` is `true`\r\n\r\nIn that case, `ALTER TABLE .. ADD PARTITION` does not update table stats automatically.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe changes fix the issue demonstrated by the example:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> create table tbl (col0 int, part int) partitioned by (part);\r\nspark-sql> insert into tbl partition (part = 0) select 0;\r\nspark-sql> set spark.sql.statistics.size.autoUpdate.enabled=true;\r\nspark-sql> alter table tbl add partition (part = 1);\r\n```\r\nthe `add partition` command should update table stats but it does not. There are no stats in the output of:\r\n```\r\nspark-sql> describe table extended tbl;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. After the changes, `ALTER TABLE .. ADD PARTITION` updates stats even when a table doesn't have stats before the command:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> alter table tbl add partition (part = 1);\r\nspark-sql> describe table extended tbl;\r\ncol0\tint\tNULL\r\npart\tint\tNULL\r\n# Partition Information\r\n# col_name\tdata_type\tcomment\r\npart\tint\tNULL\r\n\r\n# Detailed Table Information\r\n...\r\nStatistics\t2 bytes\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running new UT and existing test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive-2.3 -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly *.AlterTableAddPartitionSuite\"\r\n```","created_at":"2021-01-12T10:28:14Z","updated_at":"2021-01-12T18:28:47Z","closed_at":"2021-01-12T14:34:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d376f8f3defdb8f9e1d2e682537619b9360028ef","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31149/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31149/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31149/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/df1301ddcc85127492c1c45eedeb6b9523ab7373","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:fix-stats-in-add-partition","ref":"fix-stats-in-add-partition","sha":"df1301ddcc85127492c1c45eedeb6b9523ab7373","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nWhen generating SQL queries only the old date time API types are handled for values in org.apache.spark.sql.jdbc.JdbcDialect#compileValue. If the new API is used (spark.sql.datetime.java8API.enabled=true) Instant and LocalDate values are not quoted and errors are thrown. The change proposed is to handle Instant and LocalDate values the same way that Timestamp and Date are.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.
