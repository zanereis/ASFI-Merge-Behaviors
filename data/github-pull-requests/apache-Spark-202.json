This correctly prevents the map from growing, but `canGrowArray` incorrectly remains true. Therefore the map keeps accepting new keys and exceeds its growth threshold. If we attempt to spill the map in this state, the UnsafeKVExternalSorter will not be able to reuse the long array for sorting. By this point the task has typically consumed all available memory, so the allocation of the new pointer array is likely to fail.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the issue by setting `canGrowArray` to false in this case. This prevents the map from accepting new elements when it cannot grow to accommodate them.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWithout this change, hash aggregations will fail when the number of groups per task is greater than `MAX_CAPACITY / 2 = 2^28` (approximately 268 million), and when the grouping aggregation is the only memory-consuming operator in its stage.\r\n\r\nFor example, the final aggregation in `SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT id) FROM tbl` fails when `tbl` contains 1 billion distinct values and when `spark.sql.shuffle.partitions=1`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nReproducing this issue requires building a very large BytesToBytesMap. Because this is infeasible to do in a unit test, this PR was tested manually by adding the following test to AbstractBytesToBytesMapSuite. Before this PR, the test fails in 8.5 minutes. With this PR, the test passes in 1.5 minutes.\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic abstract class AbstractBytesToBytesMapSuite {\r\n  // ...\r\n  @Test\r\n  public void respectGrowthThresholdAtMaxCapacity() {\r\n

BytesToBytesMap map = new BytesToBytesMap(taskMemoryManager2, 1024, pageSizeBytes);\r\n\r\n    try {\r\n      // Insert keys into the map until it stops accepting new keys.\r\n      for (long i = 0; i < BytesToBytesMap.MAX_CAPACITY; i++) {\r\n        if (i % (1024 * 1024) == 0) System.out.println(\"Inserting element \" + i);\r\n        final long[] value = new long[]{i};\r\n

Platform.LONG_ARRAY_OFFSET, 8, value, Platform.LONG_ARRAY_OFFSET, 8);\r\n        if (!success) break;\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      // The map should grow to its max capacity.\r\n      long capacity =

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR changes SparkBuild.scala to ignore deprecation warnings for build with Scala 2.13 and sbt.\r\nActually, deprecation warnings are already ignored for Scala 2.12 but string matching logic for deprecation warnings should be changed for Scala 2.13.\r\nCurrently, if a warning message contains `is deprecated`, it's ignored but some warnings contain \"are deprecated` and `will be deprecated`.\r\n\r\n```\r\n[error] [warn] /home/kou/work/oss/spark-scala-2.13/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/SparkSubmit.scala:656: multiarg infix syntax looks\\\r\n like a tuple and will be deprecated                                                                                                              \r\n[error] [warn]         if (opt.clOption != null) { childArgs += (opt.clOption, opt.value) } \r\n```\r\n```\r\n[error] [warn] /home/kou/work/oss/spark-scala-2.13/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/rdd/SequenceFileRDDFunctions.scala:35: view bounds are de\\\r\nprecated; use an implicit parameter instead.                                                                                                      \r\n[error]   example: instead of `def f[A <% Int](a: A)` use `def f[A](a: A)(implicit ev: A => Int)`                                                 \r\n[error] [warn] class SequenceFileRDDFunctions[K <% Writable: ClassTag, V <% Writable : ClassTag](   \r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nBuild with the following command and confirmed deprecation warnings are not treated as fatal ( Build itself doesn't pass due to

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn current mode, when explain a SQL plan with HiveTableRelation, it will show so many info about HiveTableRelation's prunedPartition,  this make plan hard to read, this pr make this information simpler.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46485123/93012078-aeeca080-f5cf-11ea-9286-f5c15eadbee3.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nFor UT\r\n```\r\n test(\"Make HiveTableScanExec

col(\"id\").as(\"k\"))\r\n          .write\r\n          .partitionBy(\"k\")\r\n          .format(\"hive\")\r\n          .mode(\"overwrite\")\r\n          .saveAsTable(\"df\")\r\n\r\n        val df = sql(\"SELECT df.id, df.k FROM df WHERE df.k < 2\")\r\n        df.explain(true)\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter this pr will show\r\n```\r\n== Parsed Logical Plan ==\r\n'Project ['df.id,

construct `HiveTableRelation`'s `simpleString` method to avoid show too much unnecessary info in explain plan. compared to what we had before，I decrease the detail metadata of each partition and only retain the partSpec to show each partition was pruned. Since for detail information, we always don't see this in Plan but to use DESC EXTENDED statement.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nMake plan about HiveTableRelation more readable\r\n\r\n###

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd support for `orc.force.positional.evolution` config that forces ORC top level column matching by position rather than by name.\r\n\r\nThis does work in Hive:\r\n```\r\n> set orc.force.positional.evolution;\r\n+--------------------------------------+\r\n|                 set                  |\r\n+--------------------------------------+\r\n| orc.force.positional.evolution=true  |\r\n+--------------------------------------+\r\n> create table t (c1 string, c2 string) stored as orc;\r\n> insert into t values ('foo', 'bar');\r\n> alter table t change c1 c3 string;\r\n```\r\nThe orc file in this case contains the original `c1` and `c2` columns that doesn't match the metadata in HMS. But due to the positional evolution setting, Hive is capable to return all the data:\r\n```\r\n> select * from t;\r\n+--------+--------+\r\n| t.c3   | t.c2   |\r\n+--------+--------+\r\n| foo    | bar    |\r\n+--------+--------+\r\n```\r\nWithout this PR Spark returns `null`s for the renamed `c3` column.\r\n\r\nAfter this PR Spark returns the data in `c3` column.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nHive/ORC does support it. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, we will support `orc.force.positional.evolution`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew UT.","created_at":"2020-09-12T15:52:17Z","updated_at":"2021-01-15T10:23:35Z","closed_at":"2021-01-15T05:27:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"967ad7784a9cd6cedcf56f8a806f785bfe370bda","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29737/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29737/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29737/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/51f503c5738a714d6ea77467ac8f7dfba231d989","head":{"label":"peter-toth:SPARK-32864-support-orc-forced-positional-evolution","ref":"SPARK-32864-support-orc-forced-positional-evolution","sha":"51f503c5738a714d6ea77467ac8f7dfba231d989","user":{"login":"peter-toth","id":7253827,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNTM4Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7253827?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth","html_url":"https://github.com/peter-toth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":130546049,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzA1NDYwNDk=","name":"spark","full_name":"peter-toth/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"peter-toth","id":7253827,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNTM4Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7253827?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth","html_url":"https://github.com/peter-toth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/peter-toth/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR updates the `RemoveRedundantProjects` rule to make `GenerateExec` require column ordering. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n`GenerateExec` was originally considered as a node that does not require column ordering. However, `GenerateExec` binds its input rows directly with its `requiredChildOutput` without using the child's output schema. \r\nIn `doExecute()`:\r\n```scala\r\nval proj = UnsafeProjection.create(output, output)\r\n```\r\nIn `doConsume()`:\r\n```scala\r\nval values = if (requiredChildOutput.nonEmpty) {\r\n  input\r\n} else {\r\n  Seq.empty\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIn this case, changing input column ordering will result in `GenerateExec` binding the wrong schema to the input columns. For example, if we do not require child columns to be ordered, the `requiredChildOutput` [a, b, c] will directly bind to the schema of the input columns [c, b, a], which is

The timeout exceptions were caught by the `try...catch...`. Then, each task started another round barrier sync from the second `context.barrier()` and completed the sync successfully.\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n20/09/10 20:54:48.821 dispatcher-event-loop-10 INFO BarrierCoordinator: Current barrier epoch for Stage 0 (Attempt 0) is 0.\r\n20/09/10 20:54:48.822 dispatcher-event-loop-10 INFO BarrierCoordinator: Barrier sync epoch 0 from Stage 0 (Attempt 0) received update from Task 2, current progress: 1/4.\r\n20/09/10 20:54:48.826 dispatcher-BlockManagerMaster INFO BlockManagerInfo: Added broadcast_0_piece0 in memory on localhost:38420 (size: 2.2 KiB, free: 546.3 MiB)\r\n20/09/10 20:54:48.908 dispatcher-event-loop-12 INFO BarrierCoordinator: Current barrier epoch for Stage 0 (Attempt 0) is 0.\r\n20/09/10 20:54:48.909 dispatcher-event-loop-12 INFO BarrierCoordinator: Barrier sync epoch 0 from Stage 0 (Attempt 0) received update from Task 1, current progress: 2/4.\r\n20/09/10 20:54:48.959 dispatcher-event-loop-11 INFO BarrierCoordinator: Current barrier epoch for Stage 0 (Attempt 0) is 0.\r\n20/09/10 20:54:48.960 dispatcher-event-loop-11 INFO BarrierCoordinator: Barrier sync epoch 0 from Stage 0 (Attempt 0) received update from Task 3, current progress: 3/4.\r\n20/09/10 20:54:49.616 dispatcher-CoarseGrainedScheduler INFO TaskSchedulerImpl: Skip current round of resource offers for barrier stage 0 because the barrier taskSet requires 4 slots, while the total number of available slots is 0.\r\n20/09/10 20:54:49.899 dispatcher-event-loop-15 INFO BarrierCoordinator: Current barrier epoch for Stage 0 (Attempt 0) is 0.\r\n20/09/10 20:54:49.900 dispatcher-event-loop-15 INFO BarrierCoordinator: Barrier sync epoch 0 from Stage 0 (Attempt 0) received update from Task 1, current progress: 1/4.\r\n20/09/10 20:54:49.965 dispatcher-event-loop-13 INFO BarrierCoordinator: Current barrier epoch for Stage 0 (Attempt 0) is 0.\r\n20/09/10 20:54:49.966 dispatcher-event-loop-13 INFO BarrierCoordinator: Barrier sync epoch 0 from Stage 0 (Attempt 0) received update from Task 3, current progress: 2/4.\r\n20/09/10 20:54:50.112 dispatcher-event-loop-16 INFO BarrierCoordinator: Current barrier epoch for Stage 0 (Attempt 0) is 0.\r\n20/09/10 20:54:50.113 dispatcher-event-loop-16 INFO BarrierCoordinator: Barrier sync epoch 0 from Stage 0 (Attempt 0) received update from Task 0, current progress: 3/4.\r\n20/09/10 20:54:50.609 dispatcher-CoarseGrainedScheduler INFO TaskSchedulerImpl: Skip current round of resource offers for barrier stage 0 because the barrier taskSet requires 4 slots, while the total number of available slots is 0.\r\n20/09/10 20:54:50.826 dispatcher-event-loop-17 INFO BarrierCoordinator: Current barrier epoch for Stage 0 (Attempt 0) is 0.\r\n20/09/10 20:54:50.827 dispatcher-event-loop-17 INFO BarrierCoordinator: Barrier sync epoch 0 from Stage 0 (Attempt 0) received update from Task 2, current progress: 4/4.\r\n20/09/10 20:54:50.827 dispatcher-event-loop-17 INFO BarrierCoordinator: Barrier sync epoch 0 from Stage 0 (Attempt 0) received all updates from tasks, finished successfully.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to add `sinkParameter`  to check sink options robustly and independently in DataStreamReaderWriterSuite\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`LastOptions.parameters` is designed to catch three cases: `sourceSchema`, `createSource`, `createSink`. However, `StreamQuery.stop` invokes `queryExecutionThread.join`, `runStream`, `createSource` immediately and reset the stored options by `createSink`.\r\n\r\nTo catch `createSink` options, currently, the test suite is trying a workaround pattern. However, we observed a flakiness in this pattern sometimes. If we split `createSink` option separately, we don't need this workaround and can eliminate this flakiness.\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nval query = df.writeStream.\r\n   ...\r\n

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nDeprecated `KafkaConsumer.poll(long)` API calls may cause infinite wait in the driver. In this PR I've added a new `AdminClient` based offset fetching which is turned off by default. There is a new flag named `spark.sql.streaming.kafka.useDeprecatedOffsetFetching` (default: `true`) which can be set to `false` to reach the newly added functionality. The Structured Streaming migration guide contains more information what migration consideration must be done. Please see the following [doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gAh0pKgZUgyqO2Re3sAy-fdYpe_SxpJ6DkeXE8R1P7E/edit?usp=sharing) for further details.\r\n\r\nThe PR contains the following changes:\r\n* Added `AdminClient` based offset fetching\r\n* GroupId prefix feature removed from driver but only in `AdminClient` based approach (`AdminClient` doesn't need any GroupId)\r\n* GroupId override feature removed from driver but only in `AdminClient` based approach  (`AdminClient` doesn't need any GroupId)\r\n* Additional unit tests\r\n* Code comment changes\r\n* Minor bugfixes here and there\r\n* Removed Kafka auto topic creation feature but only in `AdminClient` based approach (please see doc for rationale). In short, it's super hidden, not sure anybody ever used in production + error prone.\r\n* Added documentation to `ss-migration-guide` and `structured-streaming-kafka-integration`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nDriver may hang forever.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting + additional unit tests.\r\nCluster

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSpark SQL rank window function needs to sort the data in each window partition, and it relies on the execution operator SortExec to do the sort. During sorting, the window partition key is also put at the front of the sort order and thus it brings unnecessary comparisons on the partition key. Instead, we can group the rows by the partition key first, and inside each group we sort the rows without comparing the partition key.​\r\n\r\nWe use a HashMap to store the mapping between a partition key and a sorter. All the rows corresponding to a single partition key will be inserted into the same sorter. Each sorter will sort its rows. The partition keys stored in the HashMap will also be sorted at the end. When the sort operator is ready to return the rows to the window operator, it will follow the order of the partition key to go over each sorter, and each sorter will return the rows in the window order decided by the SQL syntax “ORDER BY”. \r\n\r\nAs we cannot store an unlimited number of key-value pairs in the HashMap, we set an upper bound for the number of pairs. If the number of distinct keys in the HashMap reaches the limit, the new incoming rows will be inserted to the main sorter. This main sorter will sort the rows in the order of the partition key plus the window order. If the number of distinct keys in the HashMap is under the limit, the main sorter will be always empty. \r\n\r\nWhen there are two sequences of sorted rows in both the HashMap and the main sorter, we follow a merge sort to return the rows. We compare the next row ready to return from the HashMap and the next row ready to return from the main sorter, and always choose the one with a higher rank to return. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis is the related JIRA\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-32096?page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel&focusedCommentId=17147504\r\n\r\nThis change brings performance improvement for window function.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nSeveral minor code and documentation improvement for stream-stream join. Specifically:\r\n\r\n* Remove extending from `SparkPlan`, as extending from `BinaryExecNode` is enough.\r\n* Return `left/right.outputPartitioning` for `Left/RightOuter` in `outputPartitioning`, as the `PartitioningCollection` wrapper is unnecessary (similar to batch joins `ShuffledHashJoinExec`, `SortMergeJoinExec`).\r\n*  Avoid per-row check for join type (https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/streaming/StreamingSymmetricHashJoinExec.scala#L486-L492), by creating the method before the loop of reading rows (`generateFilteredJoinedRow` in `storeAndJoinWithOtherSide`). Similar optimization (i.e. create auxiliary method/variable per different join type before the iterator of input rows) has been done in batch join world (`SortMergeJoinExec`, `ShuffledHashJoinExec`).\r\n* Minor fix for comment/indentation for better readability.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nMinor optimization to avoid per-row unnecessary work (this probably can be optimized away by compiler, but we can do a better join to avoid it at the first place). And other comment/indentation fix to have better code readability for future developers.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29328\r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29328 , we forbid the use case that path option and path parameter are both specified.  However,  it breaks some use cases:\r\n```\r\nval dfr =  spark.read.format(...).option(...)\r\ndfr.load(path1).xxx\r\ndfr.load(path2).xxx\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe reason is that: `load` has side effects. It will set path option to the `DataFrameReader` instance. The next time you call `load`, Spark will fail because both path option and path parameter are specified.\r\n\r\nThis PR removes the side effect of `save`/`load`/`start`  to not set the path option.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nrecover some use cases\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, some use cases fail before this PR, and can run successfully after this PR.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nnew

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR cleans up the RPC message flow among the multiple decommission use cases, it includes changes:\r\n\r\n* Keep `Worker`'s decommission status be consistent between the case where decommission starts from `Worker` and the case where decommission starts from the `MasterWebUI`: sending `DecommissionWorker` from `Master` to `Worker` in the latter case.\r\n\r\n* Change from two-way communication to one-way communication when notifying decommission between driver and executor: it's obviously unnecessary for the executor to acknowledge the decommission status to the driver since the decommission request is from the driver. And it's same in reverse.\r\n\r\n* Only send one message instead of two(`DecommissionSelf`/`DecommissionBlockManager`) when decommission the executor: executor and `BlockManager` are in the same JVM.\r\n\r\n* Clean up codes around here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1948\" alt=\"WeChat56c00cc34d9785a67a544dca036d49da\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16397174/92850308-dc461c80-f41e-11ea-8ac0-287825f4e0c4.png\">\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n<img width=\"1968\" alt=\"WeChat05f7afb017e3f0132394c5e54245e49e\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16397174/93189571-de88dd80-f774-11ea-9300-1943920aa27d.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(Note the diagrams only counts those RPC calls that needed to go through the network. Local RPC calls are not counted here.)\r\n\r\nAfter this change, We reduced 6 original RPC calls and added one more RPC call for keeping the consistent decommission status for the Worker. And the RPC flow becomes more clear.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR intends to set `CODEGEN_ONLY` at `CODEGEN_FACTORY_MODE` in test spark context so that tests can fail if errors happen when generating expr code.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nI noticed that the code generation of `SafeProjection` failed in the existing test (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-32828) but it passed because `FALLBACK` was set at `CODEGEN_FACTORY_MODE` (by default) in `SharedSparkSession`. To get aware of these failures quickly, I think its worth setting `CODEGEN_ONLY` at `CODEGEN_FACTORY_MODE`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhen create a StructType from a Python dictionary you utilize the [StructType.fromJson](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/python/pyspark/sql/types.py#L569-L571) function. This function then internally calls [StructField.fromJson](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/328d81a2d1131742bcfba5117896c093db39e721/python/pyspark/sql/types.py#L425-L430) for each field in the list. This function requires that you must have all keys populated:\r\n```\r\n1. name\r\n2. type\r\n3. nullable\r\n4. metadata\r\n```\r\n`name` & `type` most definitely need to be populated but `nullable` and `metadata` can be taken care of by default args.\r\n\r\nThe constructor for [StructField](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/328d81a2d1131742bcfba5117896c093db39e721/python/pyspark/sql/types.py#L386-L395) has default arguments:\r\n```python\r\nclass StructField(DataType):\r\n    ...\r\n    def __init__(self, name, dataType, nullable=True, metadata=None):\r\n        ...\r\n        self.name = name\r\n        self.dataType = dataType\r\n        self.nullable = nullable\r\n        self.metadata = metadata or {}\r\n ```\r\n\r\nIt seems logical to mirror this when creating it from a Python dict. In addition, I added similar logic to `MapType` and `ArrayType` that follow the same pattern of **_not_** requiring keys in the JSON that have default arguments in the constructor.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis change is needed to make it easier to define JSON schemas. The excess keys provide added functionality but they are not always required so developers should not have to worry about them unless they need to.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo. There are no user facing changes. \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded unit tests to

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe optimization result of `CostBasedJoinReorder` maybe different with same input in Scala 2.12 and Scala 2.13 if there are more than one same cost candidate plans.\r\n\r\nIn this pr give a way to make the same optimization result as much as possible with same input in Scala 2.12 and Scala 2.13, the main change of this pr as follow:\r\n\r\n- Change to use `LinkedHashMap` instead of `Map` to store `foundPlans` in `JoinReorderDP.search` method to ensure same iteration order with same insert order because iteration order of `Map` behave differently under Scala 2.12 and 2.13\r\n\r\n- Fixed `StarJoinCostBasedReorderSuite` affected by the above change\r\n\r\n- Regenerate golden files affected by the above change.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe need to support a Scala 2.13 build.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- Scala 2.12: Pass the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe optimization result of `CostBasedJoinReorder` maybe different with same input in Scala 2.12 and Scala 2.13 if there are more than one same cost candidate plans.\r\n\r\nIn this pr give a way to make the optimization result deterministic as much as possible with same input in Scala 2.12 and Scala 2.13, the main change of this pr as follow:\r\n\r\n- Change to use `LinkedHashMap` instead of `Map` to store `foundPlans` in `JoinReorderDP.search` method to ensure same iteration order with same insert order because iteration order of `Map` behave differently under Scala 2.12 and 2.13\r\n\r\n- Fixed `StarJoinCostBasedReorderSuite` affected by the above change\r\n\r\n- Regenerate golden files affected by the above change.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe need to support a Scala 2.13 build.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- Scala 2.12: Pass the Jenkins or GitHub Action\r\n\r\n- Scala 2.13: All tests passed.\r\n\r\nDo the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndev/change-scala-version.sh 2.13\r\nmvn clean install -DskipTests  -pl sql/core

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAfter https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29660 and https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29689 there are 13 remaining  failed cases of sql core module with Scala 2.13.\r\n\r\nThe reason for the remaining failed cases is the optimization result of `CostBasedJoinReorder` maybe different with same input in Scala 2.12 and Scala 2.13 if there are more than one same cost candidate plans.\r\n\r\nIn this pr give a way to make the  optimization result deterministic as much as possible to pass all remaining failed cases of `sql/core` module in Scala 2.13, the main change of this pr as follow:\r\n\r\n- Change to use `LinkedHashMap` instead of `Map` to store `foundPlans` in `JoinReorderDP.search` method to ensure same iteration order with same insert order because iteration order of `Map` behave differently under Scala 2.12 and 2.13\r\n\r\n- Fixed `StarJoinCostBasedReorderSuite` affected by the above change\r\n\r\n- Regenerate golden files affected by the above change.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe need to support a Scala 2.13 build.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR proposes to add a optimization rule to combine range repartition and range operation.\r\nIf all operations between range repartition and range operation are `OrderPreservingUnaryNode`, and ordering of the repartition and range operation are the same, they can be combined.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFor the better performance.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. After this change applied, range repartition can be combined with range operation.\r\nOne example here.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```\r\nspark.range(1, 100, 1, 10).filter($\"id\" > 2).repartitionByRange(10, $\"id\").explain(true)\r\n\r\n== Optimized Logical Plan ==\r\nRepartitionByExpression [id#21L ASC NULLS FIRST], 10\r\n+- Filter (id#21L > 2)\r\n   +- Range (1, 100, step=1, splits=Some(10))\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n```\r\nspark.range(1, 100, 1, 10).filter($\"id\" > 2).repartitionByRange($\"id\").explain(true)\r\n== Optimized Logical Plan ==\r\nFilter (id#0L > 2)\r\n+- Range (1, 100, step=1, splits=Some(10))\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nNew

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis pr add support dynamic partition pruning hint.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFor some joins, one side is very small but can not broadcast, for example:\r\n- left join but left side very small\r\n- right join but the right side very small\r\n\r\nSome real case from our cluster:\r\n- Case 1:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5399861/92703898-24b0fc00-f385-11ea-8ed8-be4f9e43460a.png)\r\n- Case

partition pruning. We can add a hint to support users to force insert a dynamic partition pruning for specific side.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to check `ignoreNullability` parameter recursively in `equalsStructurally` method. This backports #29698 to branch-3.0.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n`equalsStructurally` is used to check type equality. We can optionally ask to ignore nullability check. But the parameter `ignoreNullability` is not passed recursively down to nested types. So it produces weird error like:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndata type mismatch: argument 3 requires array<array<string>> type, however ... is of array<array<string>> type.\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhen running the query `select aggregate(split('abcdefgh',''), array(array('')), (acc, x) -> array(array( x ) ) )`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, fixed a bug when running user query.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnit tests.\r\n","created_at":"2020-09-10T05:05:26Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:24:12Z","closed_at":"2020-09-10T07:07:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b133c18bba0b67122327e004e8d24c72a03a9135","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29705/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29705/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29705/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/fd176a7a0a603e250951506d3f10980b7ed184b5","head":{"label":"viirya:SPARK-32819-3.0","ref":"SPARK-32819-3.0","sha":"fd176a7a0a603e250951506d3f10980b7ed184b5","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nPyPI and CRAN did not change because of the concern about selecting Hadoop and Hive versions.\r\n\r\nFor PyPI, now there is a PR open at https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29703\r\nFor CRAN, we can already select Hadoop and Hive versions via `SparkR::install.spark`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo keep the default profiles consistent in distributions\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, the default distributions will use Hadoop 3.2.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nJenkins

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to add a way to select Hadoop and Hive versions in pip installation.\r\nUsers can select Hive or Hadoop versions as below:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nHADOOP_VERSION=3.2 pip install pyspark\r\nHIVE_VERSION=1.2 pip install pyspark\r\nHIVE_VERSION=1.2 HADOOP_VERSION=2.7 pip install pyspark\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen the environment variables are set, internally it downloads the corresponding Spark version and then sets the Spark home to it. Also this PR exposes a mirror to set as an environment variable, `PYSPARK_RELEASE_MIRROR`.\r\n\r\n**Please NOTE that:**\r\n- We cannot currently leverage pip's native installation option, for example:\r\n\r\n    ```bash\r\n    pip install pyspark --install-option=\"hadoop3.2\"\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    This is because of a limitation and bug in pip itself. Once they fix this issue, we can switch from the environment variables to the proper installation options, see SPARK-32837.\r\n\r\n    It IS possible to workaround but very ugly or hacky with a big change. See [this PR](https://github.com/microsoft/nni/pull/139/files) as an example.\r\n\r\n- In pip installation, we pack the relevant jars together. This PR _does not touch existing packaging way_ in order to prevent any behaviour changes.\r\n\r\n  Once this experimental way is proven to be safe, we can avoid packing the relevant jars together (and keep only the relevant Python scripts). And downloads the Spark distribution as this PR proposes.\r\n\r\n- This way is sort of consistent with SparkR:\r\n\r\n  SparkR provides a method `SparkR::install.spark` to support CRAN installation. This is fine because SparkR is provided purely as a R library. For example, `sparkr` script is not packed together.\r\n\r\n  PySpark cannot take this approach because PySpark packaging ships relevant executable script together, e.g.) `pyspark` shell.\r\n\r\n  If PySpark has a method such as `pyspark.install_spark`, users cannot call it in `pyspark` because `pyspark` already assumes relevant Spark is installed, JVM is launched, etc.\r\n\r\n- There looks no way to release that contains different Hadoop or Hive to PyPI due to [the version semantics](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/). This is not an option.\r\n\r\n  The usual way looks either `--install-option` above with hacks or environment variables given my investigation.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo provide users the options to select Hadoop and Hive versions.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, users will be able to select Hive and Hadoop version as below when they install it from `pip`;\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nHADOOP_VERSION=3.2 pip install pyspark\r\nHIVE_VERSION=1.2 pip install pyspark\r\nHIVE_VERSION=1.2 HADOOP_VERSION=2.7 pip install pyspark\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests were added. I also manually tested in Mac and Windows (after building Spark with `python/dist/pyspark-3.1.0.dev0.tar.gz`):\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n./build/mvn -DskipTests -Phive-thriftserver clean package\r\n```\r\n\r\nMac:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nSPARK_VERSION=3.0.1 HADOOP_VERSION=3.2 pip install pyspark-3.1.0.dev0.tar.gz\r\n```\r\n\r\nWindows:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nset HADOOP_VERSION=3.2\r\nset SPARK_VERSION=3.0.1\r\npip install pyspark-3.1.0.dev0.tar.gz\r\n```\r\n","created_at":"2020-09-10T04:29:24Z","updated_at":"2020-12-07T02:05:37Z","closed_at":"2020-09-23T00:31:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"58488baf11eaa9ffda0127c82cdb4bc9ccd9a7c6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982110661,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMTEwNjYx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/INFRA","name":"INFRA","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29703/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29703/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29703/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/20491e0cdd5b1fae207cf20d8091d4c456728b39","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-32017","ref":"SPARK-32017","sha":"20491e0cdd5b1fae207cf20d8091d4c456728b39","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nMake MicroBatchExecution explicitly call `getBatch` when the start and end offsets are the same.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nStructured Streaming micro-batch engine has the contract with V1 data sources that, after a restart, it will call `source.getBatch()` on the last batch attempted before the restart. However, a very rare combination of sequences violates this contract. It occurs only when\r\n- The streaming query has specific types of stateful operations with watermarks (e.g., aggregation in append, mapGroupsWithState with timeouts).\r\n    - These queries can execute a batch even without new data when the previous updates the watermark and the stateful ops are such that the new watermark can cause new output/cleanup. Such batches are called no-data-batches.\r\n- The last batch before termination was an incomplete no-data-batch. Upon restart, the micro-batch engine fails to call `source.getBatch` when attempting to re-execute the incomplete no-data-batch.\r\n\r\nThis occurs because no-data-batches has the same and end offsets, and when a batch is executed, if the start and end offset is same then calling `source.getBatch` is skipped as it is assumed the generated plan will be empty. This only affects V1 data sources which rely on this invariant to detect in the source whether the query is being started from scratch or restarted.\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit test with a mock v1 source that fails without the fix.\r\n","created_at":"2020-09-09T23:59:34Z","updated_at":"2020-09-11T08:02:44Z","closed_at":"2020-09-11T07:28:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6e39ee0eb24cd7153b248b0b3bbd82ac3bd4d668","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

So it produces weird error like:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndata type mismatch: argument 3 requires array<array<string>> type, however ... is of array<array<string>> type.\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhen running the query `select aggregate(split('abcdefgh',''), array(array('')), (acc, x) -> array(array( x ) ) )`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, fixed a bug when running user query.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nMake MicroBatchExecution explicitly call `getBatch` when the start and end offsets are the same.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nStructured Streaming micro-batch engine has the contract with V1 data sources that, after a restart, it will call `source.getBatch()` on the last batch attempted before the restart. However, a very rare combination of sequences violates this contract. It occurs only when\r\n- The streaming query has specific types of stateful operations with watermarks (e.g., aggregation in append, mapGroupsWithState with timeouts).\r\n    - These queries can execute a batch even without new data when the previous updates the watermark and the stateful ops are such that the new watermark can cause new output/cleanup. Such batches are called no-data-batches.\r\n- The last batch before termination was an incomplete no-data-batch. Upon restart, the micro-batch engine fails to call `source.getBatch` when attempting to re-execute the incomplete no-data-batch.\r\n\r\nThis occurs because no-data-batches has the same and end offsets, and when a batch is executed, if the start and end offset is same then calling `source.getBatch` is skipped as it is assumed the generated plan will be empty. This only affects V1 data sources which rely on this invariant to detect in the source whether the query is being started from scratch or restarted.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit test with a mock v1 source that fails without the fix.\r\n","created_at":"2020-09-09T18:00:11Z","updated_at":"2020-09-10T01:25:38Z","closed_at":"2020-09-10T01:25:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1100eadf6d31218e71770345c629023a8579e2c1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR renames `SupportsStreamingUpdate` to `SupportsStreamingUpdateAsAppend` as the new interface name represents the actual behavior clearer. This PR also removes the `update()` method (so the interface is more likely a marker), as the implementations of `SupportsStreamingUpdateAsAppend` should support append mode by default, hence no need to trigger some flag on it.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSupportsStreamingUpdate was intended to revive the functionality of Streaming update output mode for internal data sources, but despite the name, that interface isn't really used to do actual update on sink; all sinks are implementing this interface to do append, so strictly saying, it's just to support update as append. Renaming the interface would make it clear.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, as the class is only for internal data sources.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nJenkins test will follow.","created_at":"2020-09-09T12:17:16Z","updated_at":"2020-09-10T06:33:57Z","closed_at":"2020-09-10T06:33:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b26b877ceb235945b2ed1a6589c246fdd925a348","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFor BroadcastNestedLoopJoin, we will broadcast boradcast-side child to all executor and use stream side partition's data traversal broadcast-side data one-by-one. \r\n\r\nWe have meet some case that stream side data skew and all success task wait for skewed partition to finish.\r\n\r\nWe know that the execution time increases exponentially with the amount of partition's data.\r\n\r\nIf skewd with 100x,  skewed partition's data will execute 100x than non-skewed part.\r\n\r\nIt is a bottleneck， with AE, we can avoid this by  split skewed part's data  to make it more balanced.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nNO\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNO\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to move the test `SPARK-32810: CSV and JSON data sources should be able to read files with escaped glob metacharacter in the paths` from `DataFrameReaderWriterSuite` to `CSVSuite` and to `JsonSuite`. This will allow to run the same test in `CSVv1Suite`/`CSVv2Suite` and in `JsonV1Suite`/`JsonV2Suite`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo improve test coverage by checking JSON/CSV datasources v1 and v2.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running affected test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/test:testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.csv.*\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/test:testOnly

Also note that the Java arrow-memory artifact has been split to separate dependence on netty-buffer and allow users to select an allocator. Spark will continue to use `arrow-memory-netty` to maintain performance benefits. \r\n\r\nVersion 1.0.0 - 1.0.0 include the following selected fixes/improvements relevant to Spark users:\r\n\r\nARROW-9300 - [Java] Separate Netty Memory to its own module\r\nARROW-9272 - [C++][Python] Reduce complexity in python to arrow conversion\r\nARROW-9016 - [Java] Remove direct references to Netty/Unsafe Allocators\r\nARROW-8664 - [Java] Add skip null check to all Vector types\r\nARROW-8485 - [Integration][Java] Implement extension types integration\r\nARROW-8434 - [C++] Ipc RecordBatchFileReader deserializes the Schema multiple times\r\nARROW-8314 - [Python] Provide a method to select a subset of columns of a Table\r\nARROW-8230 - [Java] Move Netty memory manager into a separate module\r\nARROW-8229 - [Java] Move ArrowBuf into the Arrow package\r\nARROW-7955 - [Java] Support large buffer for file/stream IPC\r\nARROW-7831 - [Java] unnecessary buffer allocation when calling splitAndTransferTo on variable width vectors\r\nARROW-6111 - [Java] Support LargeVarChar and LargeBinary types and add integration test with C++\r\nARROW-6110 - [Java] Support LargeList Type and add integration test with C++\r\nARROW-5760 - [C++] Optimize Take implementation\r\nARROW-300 - [Format] Add body buffer compression option to IPC message protocol using LZ4 or ZSTD\r\nARROW-9098 - RecordBatch::ToStructArray cannot handle record batches with 0 column\r\nARROW-9066 - [Python] Raise correct error in isnull()\r\nARROW-9223 - [Python] Fix to_pandas() export for timestamps within structs\r\nARROW-9195 - [Java] Wrong usage of Unsafe.get from bytearray in ByteFunctionsHelper class\r\nARROW-7610 - [Java] Finish support for 64 bit int allocations \r\nARROW-8115 - [Python] Conversion when mixing NaT and datetime objects not working\r\nARROW-8392 - [Java] Fix overflow related corner cases for vector value comparison\r\nARROW-8537 - [C++] Performance regression from ARROW-8523\r\nARROW-8803 - [Java] Row count should be set before loading buffers in VectorLoader\r\nARROW-8911 - [C++] Slicing a ChunkedArray with zero chunks segfaults\r\n\r\nView release notes here:\r\nhttps://arrow.apache.org/release/1.0.1.html\r\nhttps://arrow.apache.org/release/1.0.0.html\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to move the test `SPARK-32810: CSV and JSON data sources should be able to read files with escaped glob metacharacter in the paths` from `DataFrameReaderWriterSuite` to `CSVSuite` and to `JsonSuite`. This will allow to run the same test in `CSVv1Suite`/`CSVv2Suite` and in `JsonV1Suite`/`JsonV2Suite`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo improve test coverage by checking JSON/CSV datasources v1 and v2.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running affected test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt

But its using a HashSet so if the addresses are the same then you lose the correct amount.  ie worker1 has gpu addresses 0,1,2,3 and worker2 has addresses 0,1,2,3 then you only see 4 total GPUs when there are 8.\r\n\r\nIn this case we don't really need to create the MutableResourceInfo at all because we just want the sums for used and total so just remove the use of it.  The other uses of it are per Worker so those should be ok.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR changes the behavior of RangeExec with WholeStageCodegen disabled or falled back to change the number of partitions to zero when a range is empty.\r\n\r\nIn the current master, if WholeStageCodegen effects, the number of partitions of an empty range will be changed to zero. \r\n```\r\nspark.range(1, 1, 1, 1000).rdd.getNumPartitions\r\nres0: Int = 0\r\n```\r\nBut it doesn't if WholeStageCodegen is disabled or falled back.\r\n```\r\nspark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.codegen.wholeStage\", false)\r\nspark.range(1, 1, 1, 1000).rdd.getNumPartitions\r\nres2: Int = 1000 \r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo archive better performance even though WholeStageCodegen disabled or falled back.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. the number of partitions gotten with `getNumPartitions` for an empty range will be changed when WholeStageCodegen is disabled.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nNew test.","created_at":"2020-09-08T11:25:10Z","updated_at":"2020-09-11T00:12:01Z","closed_at":"2020-09-11T00:11:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"16dfee6bf88add29f35bfdbb069edd5018f1fbef","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29681/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29681/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29681/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c3f2f6740c12bdd6e9d25e3cc8c707b359cc53d7","head":{"label":"sarutak:zero-size-range","ref":"zero-size-range","sha":"c3f2f6740c12bdd6e9d25e3cc8c707b359cc53d7","user":{"login":"sarutak","id":4736016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak","html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19300892,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTMwMDg5Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"sarutak/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sarutak","id":4736016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzYwMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4736016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak","html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarutak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sarutak/spark","description":"Mirror

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR intends to fix a bug where references can be missing when adding aliases to widen data types in `WidenSetOperationTypes`. For example,\r\n```\r\nCREATE OR REPLACE TEMPORARY VIEW t3 AS VALUES (decimal(1)) tbl(v);\r\nSELECT t.v FROM (\r\n  SELECT v FROM t3\r\n  UNION ALL\r\n  SELECT v + v AS v FROM t3\r\n) t;\r\n\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: Resolved attribute(s) v#1 missing from v#3 in operator !Project [v#1]. Attribute(s) with the same name appear in the operation: v. Please check if the right attribute(s) are used.;;\r\n!Project [v#1]  <------ the reference got missing\r\n+- SubqueryAlias t\r\n   +- Union\r\n      :- Project [cast(v#1 as decimal(11,0)) AS v#3]\r\n      :  +- Project [v#1]\r\n      :     +- SubqueryAlias t3\r\n      :        +- SubqueryAlias tbl\r\n      :           +- LocalRelation [v#1]\r\n      +- Project [v#2]\r\n         +- Project [CheckOverflow((promote_precision(cast(v#1 as decimal(11,0))) + promote_precision(cast(v#1 as decimal(11,0)))), DecimalType(11,0), true) AS v#2]\r\n            +- SubqueryAlias t3\r\n               +- SubqueryAlias tbl\r\n                  +- LocalRelation [v#1]\r\n```\r\nIn the case, `WidenSetOperationTypes` added the alias `cast(v#1 as decimal(11,0)) AS v#3`, then the reference in the top `Project` got missing. This PR correct the reference (`exprId` and widen `dataType`) after adding aliases in the rule.\r\n\r\nThis backport for 3.0 comes from #29485 and #29643\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR changes `EnsureRequirements` to let it remove redundant `ShuffleExchange`.\r\nNormally, redundant repartition operations are removed by `CollapseRepartition` rule but `EnsureRequirements` can insert another `HashPartitioning` or `RangePartitioning` immediately after the repartition, leading adjacent `ShuffleExchange` will be in the physical plan.\r\nEven if their `outputPartitioning` are different, those adjacent `ShuffleExcnahge` are redundant.\r\n\r\nAn example.\r\n```\r\nval ordered = spark.range(1, 100).repartitionByRange(10, $\"id\".desc).orderBy($\"id\")\r\nordered.explain(true)\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\n*(2) Sort [id#0L ASC NULLS FIRST], true, 0\r\n+- Exchange rangepartitioning(id#0L ASC NULLS FIRST, 200), true, [id=#15]\r\n   +- Exchange rangepartitioning(id#0L DESC NULLS LAST, 10), false, [id=#14]\r\n      +- *(1) Range (1, 100, step=1, splits=12)\r\n```\r\nIn this case, the lower `Exchange` for `rangepartitioning` is redundant.\r\n\r\nAnother example.\r\n```\r\nspark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold\", 0)\r\nval left = Seq(1,2,3).toDF.repartition(10)\r\nval right = Seq(1,2,3).toDF\r\nval joined = left.join(right, left(\"value\") + 1 === right(\"value\"))\r\njoined.explain(true)\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\n*(3) SortMergeJoin [(value#11 + 1)], [value#1], Inner\r\n:- *(1) Sort [(value#11 + 1) ASC NULLS FIRST], false, 0\r\n:  +- Exchange hashpartitioning((value#11 + 1), 200), true, [id=#41]\r\n:     +- Exchange RoundRobinPartitioning(10), false, [id=#37]\r\n:        +- LocalTableScan [value#11]\r\n+- *(2) Sort [value#1 ASC NULLS FIRST], false, 0\r\n   +- Exchange hashpartitioning(value#1, 200), true, [id=#42]\r\n      +- LocalTableScan [value#1]\r\n```\r\nIn this case, the lower `Exchange for `RoundRobinPartitioning` inserted by `EnsureRequirements` for the left side is not necessary.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo remove unnecessary shuffle.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. After this change, such redundant `ShuffleExchange` will be removed.\r\n```\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\n*(2) Sort [id#0L ASC NULLS FIRST], true, 0\r\n+- Exchange rangepartitioning(id#0L ASC NULLS FIRST, 200), true, [id=#14]\r\n   +- *(1) Range (1, 100, step=1, splits=12)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\n*(3) SortMergeJoin [(value#6 + 1)], [value#1], Inner\r\n:- *(1) Sort [(value#6 + 1) ASC NULLS FIRST], false, 0\r\n:  +- Exchange hashpartitioning((value#6 + 1), 200), true, [id=#16]\r\n:     +- LocalTableScan [value#6]\r\n+- *(2) Sort [value#1 ASC NULLS FIRST], false, 0\r\n   +- Exchange hashpartitioning(value#1, 200), true, [id=#17]\r\n      +- LocalTableScan [value#1]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to fix an issue with LibSVM datasource when both of the following are true:\r\n* no user specified schema\r\n* some file paths contain escaped glob metacharacters, such as `[``]`, `{``}`, `*` etc.\r\n\r\nThe fix is a backport of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29675, and it is based on another bug fix for CSV/JSON datasources https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29663.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo fix the issue when the follow two queries try to read from paths `[abc]`:\r\n```scala\r\nspark.read.format(\"libsvm\").load(\"\"\"/tmp/\\[abc\\].csv\"\"\").show\r\n```\r\nbut would end up hitting an exception:\r\n```\r\nPath does not exist:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to fix an issue with LibSVM datasource when both of the following are true:\r\n* no user specified schema\r\n* some file paths contain escaped glob metacharacters, such as `[``]`, `{``}`, `*` etc.\r\n\r\nThe fix is a backport of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29670, and it is based on another bug fix for CSV/JSON datasources https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29659.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo fix the issue when the follow two queries try to read from paths `[abc]`:\r\n```scala\r\nspark.read.format(\"libsvm\").load(\"\"\"/tmp/\\[abc\\].csv\"\"\").show\r\n```\r\nbut would end up hitting an exception:\r\n```\r\nPath does not exist:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR fixes a conflict between `RewriteDistinctAggregates` and `DecimalAggregates`.\r\nIn some cases, `DecimalAggregates` will wrap the decimal column to `UnscaledValue` using\r\ndifferent rules for different aggregates.\r\n\r\nThis means, same distinct column with different aggregates will change to different distinct columns\r\nafter `DecimalAggregates`. For example:\r\n`avg(distinct decimal_col), sum(distinct decimal_col)` may change to\r\n`avg(distinct UnscaledValue(decimal_col)), sum(distinct decimal_col)`\r\n\r\nWe assume after `RewriteDistinctAggregates`, there will be at most one distinct column in aggregates,\r\nbut `DecimalAggregates` breaks this assumption. To fix this, we have to switch the order of these two\r\nrules.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nbug fix\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nno\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nadded test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThere are some cases that we have history hive  table, in the past, it use `TEXTFILE` serde, later  it's change to `ORC` serde, since during metastore convert, we will use table level serde to scan all partition, if some old partition's file format is not same , will failed to convert , we need to close metastore convert and restart spark program then run.\r\nBut we know that enable hive metastore convert can speed up data r/w, and avoid many minor problem.\r\nIt's bad for ad-hoc engine such as long running spark thrift server. so I think it's necessary to make these two config can be changed by use in session level\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nMake use range more flexiable\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to fix an issue with LibSVM datasource when both of the following are true:\r\n* no user specified schema\r\n* some file paths contain escaped glob metacharacters, such as `[``]`, `{``}`, `*` etc.\r\n\r\nThe fix is based on another bug fix for CSV/JSON datasources https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29659.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo fix the issue when the follow two queries try to read from paths `[abc]`:\r\n```scala\r\nspark.read.format(\"libsvm\").load(\"\"\"/tmp/\\[abc\\].csv\"\"\").show\r\n```\r\nbut

plans.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n@cloud-fan [made a good point](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29593#discussion_r482013121) that it doesn't make sense to append tags to existing nodes when nodes are removed. That will cause such bugs as duplicate rows when deduplicating and repartitioning by the same column with AQE.\r\n\r\n```\r\nspark.range(10).union(spark.range(10)).createOrReplaceTempView(\"v1\")\r\nval df = spark.sql(\"select id from v1 group by id distribute by id\") \r\nprintln(df.collect().toArray.mkString(\",\"))\r\nprintln(df.queryExecution.executedPlan)\r\n\r\n// With AQE\r\n[4],[0],[3],[2],[1],[7],[6],[8],[5],[9],[4],[0],[3],[2],[1],[7],[6],[8],[5],[9]\r\nAdaptiveSparkPlan(isFinalPlan=true)\r\n+- CustomShuffleReader local\r\n   +- ShuffleQueryStage 0\r\n      +- Exchange hashpartitioning(id#183L, 10), true\r\n         +- *(3) HashAggregate(keys=[id#183L], functions=[], output=[id#183L])\r\n            +- Union\r\n               :- *(1) Range (0, 10, step=1, splits=2)\r\n               +- *(2) Range (0, 10, step=1, splits=2)\r\n\r\n// Without AQE\r\n[4],[7],[0],[6],[8],[3],[2],[5],[1],[9]\r\n*(4) HashAggregate(keys=[id#206L], functions=[], output=[id#206L])\r\n+- Exchange hashpartitioning(id#206L, 10), true\r\n   +- *(3) HashAggregate(keys=[id#206L], functions=[], output=[id#206L])\r\n      +- Union\r\n         :- *(1) Range (0, 10, step=1, splits=2)\r\n         +- *(2) Range (0, 10, step=1, splits=2)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's too expensive to detect node removal so we make a compromise only to copy tags to node with no tags.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR add extra optimization for OptimizeIN rule. i.e when checking against a continuous set of values e.g `x IN (1,3,2,4,2)`, the rule can be simplified to `x >= 1 AND x <= 4` \r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n* make evaluating batch filtering faster e.g. parquet row group filter: and(gte(x, 1), lte(x, 4)) instead of evaluating or(or(or(eq(x, 1), eq(x, 2)), eq(x, 3)), eq(x, 4)) which is O(N)\r\n* make query string more compact. As you seen previously, the filter tree can become deeply nested. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nadd

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe purpose of this pr is to partial resolve [SPARK-32808](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-32808), total of 26 failed test cases were fixed, the related suite as follow:\r\n\r\n- `StreamingAggregationSuite` related test cases (2 FAILED -> Pass)\r\n\r\n- `GeneratorFunctionSuite` related test cases (2 FAILED -> Pass)\r\n\r\n- `UDFSuite` related test cases (2 FAILED -> Pass)\r\n\r\n- `SQLQueryTestSuite` related test cases (5 FAILED -> Pass)\r\n\r\n- `WholeStageCodegenSuite` related test cases (1 FAILED -> Pass)\r\n\r\n- `DataFrameSuite` related test cases (3 FAILED -> Pass)\r\n\r\n- `OrcV1QuerySuite\\OrcV2QuerySuite` related test cases (4 FAILED -> Pass)\r\n\r\n- `ExpressionsSchemaSuite` related test cases (1 FAILED -> Pass)\r\n\r\n- `DataFrameStatSuite` related test cases (1 FAILED -> Pass)\r\n\r\n- `JsonV1Suite\\JsonV2Suite\\JsonLegacyTimeParserSuite` related test cases (6 FAILED -> Pass)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe main change of this pr as following:\r\n\r\n- Fix Scala 2.13 compilation problems in   `ShuffleBlockFetcherIterator`  and `Analyzer`\r\n\r\n- Specified `Seq` to `scala.collection.Seq` in `objects.scala` and `GenericArrayData` because internal use `Seq` maybe `mutable.ArraySeq` and not easy to call `.toSeq`\r\n\r\n- Should specified `Seq` to `scala.collection.Seq`  when we call `Row.getAs[Seq]` and `Row.get(i).asInstanceOf[Seq]` because the data maybe `mutable.ArraySeq` but `Seq` is `immutable.Seq` in Scala 2.13\r\n\r\n- Use a compatible way to let `+` and `-` method  of `Decimal` having the same behavior in Scala 2.12 and Scala 2.13\r\n\r\n- Call `toList` in `RelationalGroupedDataset.toDF` method when `groupingExprs` is `Stream` type because `Stream` can't serialize in Scala 2.13\r\n\r\n- Add a manual sort to `classFunsMap` in `ExpressionsSchemaSuite` because `Iterable.groupBy` in Scala 2.13 has different result with `TraversableLike.groupBy`  in Scala 2.12\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe need to support a Scala 2.13 build.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nShould specified `Seq` to `scala.collection.Seq`  when we call `Row.getAs[Seq]` and `Row.get(i).asInstanceOf[Seq]` because the data maybe `mutable.ArraySeq` but the `Seq` is `immutable.Seq` in Scala 2.13\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- Scala 2.12: Pass the Jenkins or GitHub Action\r\n\r\n- Scala 2.13: Do the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndev/change-scala-version.sh 2.13\r\nmvn clean install -DskipTests  -pl sql/core -Pscala-2.13 -am\r\nmvn test -pl sql/core -Pscala-2.13\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Before**\r\n```\r\nTests: succeeded 8166, failed 319, canceled 1, ignored 52, pending 0\r\n*** 319 TESTS FAILED ***\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n**After**\r\n\r\n```\r\nTests: succeeded 8204, failed 286, canceled 1, ignored 52, pending 0\r\n*** 286 TESTS FAILED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to fix an issue with the CSV and JSON data sources in Spark SQL when both of the following are true:\r\n* no user specified schema\r\n* some file paths contain escaped glob metacharacters, such as `[``]`, `{``}`, `*` etc.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo fix the issue when the follow two queries try to read from paths `[abc].csv` and `[abc].json`:\r\n```scala\r\nspark.read.csv(\"\"\"/tmp/\\[abc\\].csv\"\"\").show\r\nspark.read.json(\"\"\"/tmp/\\[abc\\].json\"\"\").show\r\n```\r\nbut would end up hitting

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR proposes to optimize SortMergeJoin (SMJ) if each of its children has hash output partitioning which \"partially\" satisfies the required distribution. In this case where the child's output partitioning expressions are a subset of required distribution expressions (join keys expressions), the shuffle can be removed because rows will be sorted by join keys before rows are joined (the required child ordering for SMJ is on join keys).\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces `OptimizeSortMergeJoinWithPartialHashDistribution ` which removes shuffle for the sort merge join if the following conditions are met:\r\n - The child of ShuffleExchangeExec has HashPartitioning with the same number of partitions as the other side of join.\r\n - The child of ShuffleExchangeExec has output partitioning which has the subset of join keys on the respective join side.\r\n\r\nThis rule can be turned on by setting `spark.sql.execution.sortMergeJoin.optimizePartialHashDistribution.enabled` to `true` (`false` by default).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently `RunLengthEncoding#Encoder` uses `SpecificInternalRow` as a holder for the current value when calculating compression stats and doing the actual compression. It calls `ColumnType.copyField` and `ColumnType.getField` on the internal row which incurs extra cost comparing to directly operating on the internal type. This proposes to replace the `SpecificInternalRow` with `T#InternalType` to avoid the extra cost.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nOperating on `SpecificInternalRow` carries certain cost and negatively impact performance when using `RunLengthEncoding` for compression.\r\n\r\nWith the change I see some improvements through `CompressionSchemeBenchmark`:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-9880H CPU @ 2.30GHz\r\n BOOLEAN Encode:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nMake MicroBatchExecution explicitly call `getBatch` when the start and end offsets are the same.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nStructured Streaming micro-batch engine has the contract with V1 data sources that, after a restart, it will call `source.getBatch()` on the last batch attempted before the restart. However, a very rare combination of sequences violates this contract. It occurs only when\r\n- The streaming query has specific types of stateful operations with watermarks (e.g., aggregation in append, mapGroupsWithState with timeouts).\r\n    - These queries can execute a batch even without new data when the previous updates the watermark and the stateful ops are such that the new watermark can cause new output/cleanup. Such batches are called no-data-batches.\r\n- The last batch before termination was an incomplete no-data-batch. Upon restart, the micro-batch engine fails to call `source.getBatch` when attempting to re-execute the incomplete no-data-batch.\r\n\r\nThis occurs because no-data-batches has the same and end offsets, and when a batch is executed, if the start and end offset is same then calling `source.getBatch` is skipped as it is assumed the generated plan will be empty. This only affects V1 data sources like Delta and Autoloader which rely on this invariant to detect in the source whether the query is being started from scratch or restarted.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit test with a mock v1 source that fails without the fix.\r\n","created_at":"2020-09-04T17:49:18Z","updated_at":"2020-09-09T17:37:28Z","closed_at":"2020-09-09T17:37:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7c64f48493cd84eeaf4884eae937f277f0240bdd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n`InferFiltersFromConstraints` only infers new filters using `EqualTo`, generalized it to also include `EqualNullSafe`. \r\n\r\nThis introduced an infinite loop in `InferFiltersFromConstraintsSuite`. It has been fixed in the `Optimizer` by restructuring the batches (#19149) - I did the same in the test suite.\r\n\r\nAlso it revealed, that the `InferFiltersFromConstraints` is not idempotent, for two cases:\r\n- A chain of filters like `\"x.a\".attr === \"x.b\".attr && \"x.a\".attr === \"y.a\".attr && \"x.b\".attr === \"y.b\".attr`, that should infer `\"y.a\".attr === \"y.b\".attr`\r\n- Constraints form the right side of left semi join are ignored when it is a child of a another join\r\n\r\nThese were also fixed\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nPossible performance improvement from new inferred constraints\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nNo need of using database name in `loadPartition` API of `Shim_v3_0` to get the hive table, in hive there is a overloaded method which gives hive table using table name. By using this API dependency with `SessionCatalog` can be removed in Shim layer\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo avoid deadlock when communicating with Hive metastore 3.1.x\r\n```\r\nFound

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a Spark 3.0 regression introduced by https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/26761. We missed a corner case that `java.lang.Double.compare` treats 0.0 and -0.0 as different, which breaks SQL semantic.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds back the `OrderingUtil`, to provide custom compare methods that take care of 0.0 vs -0.0\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFix a correctness bug.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, now `SELECT  0.0 > -0.0` returns false correctly as Spark 2.x.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nnew

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch adds nested struct support to `Column.withField` API.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently `Column.withField` only supports `StructType`. For nested struct in `ArrayType`, it doesn't support. We can support nested struct in array to make the API more general and useful.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes. Adding nested struct support to `Column.withField` API.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnit
