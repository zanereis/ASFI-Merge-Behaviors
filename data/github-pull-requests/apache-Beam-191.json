Jenkins test environment is very memory constraint. We get killed by the\r\nhost OS (exit code 137) while running tests for multiple FlinkRunner\r\nversions (1.5/1.6/1.7) in parallel. Disabling tests for 1.7 did not fix the\r\nissue. Thus, I'm also disabling test execution for 1.6.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, it seems to be a Jenkins problem because the test JVM can't\r\nacquire the max memory that it has been provided (currently set to max 4GB per\r\nparallel instance) without getting killed by the host OS.\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

PR replaces shaded private uses of Guava with vendored Guava. Instead of relocating and bundling in each jar we produce, Guava is relocated once and published, and everything depends on this artifact.\r\n\r\nThe process by which I produced this PR, since hand-review is not easy via GitHub (maybe OK via Reviewable.io):\r\n\r\n - global search and replace of `compile library.java.guava` with `shadow library.java.vendored_guava_20_0`\r\n - global search and replace of `com.google.common` imports to add the `org.apache.vendor.guava.v20_0.` prefix\r\n - look for compile errors and revert them manually\r\n - huge surprise that this was sufficient; yay!\r\n\r\nNot all uses of Guava in our codebase are shaded private uses. Cassandra, Kinesis, Bigtable, and Calcite all use Guava on their essential public API surface.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

Add a dependency on Tenacity, a general-purpose retry library: https://github.com/jd/tenacity.\r\n2. Make statesampler_test easier to configure and adjust it to reduce flakiness: make the fastest state last 1 second, or total test runtime to last 6 seconds, and retry once if the test fails. This should reduce flakiness below 1 in 100000. Alternative considered: keep current state duration, but retry 5 times. The alternative would be less sensitive to a potential change in statesampler that would result in real loss of precision in measurement. \r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

jenkins job timeouted because we used only 10 workers and set a default 2 hours timeout on jenkins. I increased both the timeout (to 4 hrs) and workers (to --maxNumWorkers=32). I'm unsure if those are the right values - they certainly do the job (no timeout) but is it ok to use 32 workers? \r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

SdkComponents, Coders (and other model pipeline concepts) get registered.  Previously, identity was used to compare Coders, instead of Coder equals().  This leads to equivalent Coders being created leading to separate Coder ids and entries in the model pipeline proto etc.  It also leads to Coders created during internal expansion of PTransforms (e.g. Combine.perKey()'s accumulatorCoder) appearing to be different (and getting a different id) than the equivalent Coder known when the model pipeline proto was computed.  This PR switches to equals() to compare Coders, so that it's no longer a problem to create equivalent Coder representations.\r\n\r\nR: @kennknowles

Removed a few compiler suppresses that no longer needed (and do not work with checkstyle's naming convention).\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this PR the violations are shown as warnings, for following step, we could either\r\na) keep them as warnings, and switch to error when all are addressed (either adding comment or suppress). \r\nb) change them into errors, and add explicit suppression rules to all

idea behind `AtomicInsertTest#testAtomicInsert` is to check what happens if inserts fail. The table is mocked in a way, that there is 60% probability for an insert to succeed. Therefore, approximately 20 attempts should be enough. However, after refactoring from setting backoff duration to cumulative duration it never worked as it was intended. I refactored the code to make it more robust.\r\n\r\nR: @chamikaramj \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

Adds support for dynamic sql in JdbcIO write, via ValueProvider<String>`. Changed the JdbcIO and test cases to support this feature. It will now support withStatement(ValueProvider<String> statement) along with withStatement(String statement)  as before. The change is backward compatible and won't break earlier API. Added extra test case to support this feature.\r\n@coheigea @timrobertson100 \r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

local_job_service.py module was too complex and had a number of multi-threaded issues. One of the issue was that the Get(Message|State)Stream methods did not guarantee the consumer would see all message/state transitions. Another issue was a data race between messages and state transitions. In the test the PortableRunner would try and wait for any last messages. However, there was a race between receiving the message and the PortableRunner waiting for a terminal state. What might have happened was a job transition into a terminal state and the consumer would not receive the message, failing the test.\r\n\r\nNote: I wasn't able to repro the bug on my local machine but did my best to zero in on any multi-threading issues. There may be follow-up PRs to fix the issue if it pops up again.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.
