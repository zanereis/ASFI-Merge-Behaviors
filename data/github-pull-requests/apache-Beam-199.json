bug in the Website_Stage_GCS job was causing the Jenkins job to wipe\r\nout the top-level GCS bucket used to stage and serve the website from.\r\nThis ends up blocking all future runs of the job and takes manual effort\r\nto recreate and configure the bucket.\r\n\r\nThis change ensures that a valid baseUrl is provided before running\r\ngsutil commands, and uses rsync instead of gsutil rm && gsutil cp. This\r\nis both safer and more efficient.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

Problem\r\n\r\nRedisIO has EXEC without MULTI error after set a batch of records.\r\n\r\nAfter investigate the source code, I guess there is missing `pipeline.multi();` after exec() the last batch.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/java/io/redis/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/io/redis/RedisIO.java#L555\r\n\r\nI have simulated the flow in `redis-cli`\r\n```\r\nredis:6379> multi\r\nOK\r\nredis:6379> set foo 1\r\nQUEUED\r\nredis:6379> set bar 2\r\nQUEUED\r\nredis:6379> exec\r\n1) OK\r\n2) OK\r\nredis:6379> exec\r\n(error) ERR EXEC

tests in Beam fail to pass on Python 3, and also prevent tox test suite from making progress. This PR disables such tests. We recently started to use RUN_SKIPPED_PY3_TESTS variable to force skipped tests to be included into a Python 3 test suite, however since the tests excluded in this PR interrupt test suite execution, they will not be included even if we set RUN_SKIPPED_PY3_TESTS=1. Luckily, there are only a few of such tests.\r\n\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

is a rough attempt at addressing BEAM-5707. This is something we've found very useful internally for validating streaming functionality in the python SDK without needing a real streaming source like kafka or kinesis.\r\n\r\nI'm still pretty new to beam, so wanted to get feedback early (before cleaning things up, writing docs, tests, etc).\r\n\r\nA few questions up front:\r\n* Should something like this have a standard beam URN? Currently I'm using `flink:transform:streaming_impulse:v1`.\r\n* How should configuration be serialized between the python pipeline and the flink translation code? I've used JSON here; should it be protobuf or something else?\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

This is required since Kafka topic names and cluster configuration may not be available at graph construction time.\r\n\r\nThis implies that we cannot adjust number of splits based on number of Kafka partitions. In order to get around this limitation this lets users explicitly specify number of splits (`withNumSplits()`). We can handle this better if we can let some splits not to have any partitions assigned at runtime. We need to something like that to be able to merge this into master. \r\n\r\nFor now, this PR will serve as good starting point for developing templates with KafkaIO.\r\n[cc: @azurezyq, @pupamanyu]

gradle tasks have special support for when running within the context of a PR, in order to stage files on GCS. However, adding this support broke the non-PR mode along the way.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, using a PR-based `baseUrl` would break the http-proofer internal URL checks, because it would expect to find resources at a /1234/ prefix path. The fix for this is to actually generate content in that prefixed location.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes all tasks consistent with how they expect and use baseurl paths.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable. This will automatically link the pull request to the issue.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\nIt will help us expedite review of your Pull Request if you tag someone (e.g. `@username`) to look at it.\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status

https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/c34c367f5da6f9bef8a46471195470923a201af9/sdks/python/apache_beam/coders/coders_test_common.py#L61\r\n\r\nI have added  `def setUpClass(cls)` if it wasn't available
