values of `min` and `extent` in Range should have the same type, but the usage of convenience may often produce type mismatches, for example `Range(0, dim)` will assume int32 for the min. These mismatches can then cause hard-to-track errors, in particular assertions in the arithmetic simplifier. Such problems are likely to occur when a mismatched range is bound to a variable.\r\n\r\nThis patch identifies a few occurrences where a Range is bound to a Var, and checks that all types match. In case of a mismatch, types of compile- time immediates can be adjusted, otherwise an error is reported.","created_at":"2023-10-10T15:28:47Z","updated_at":"2025-02-08T00:11:32Z","closed_at":"2025-02-08T00:11:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15909/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15909/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/15909/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/ed6b74f7313c99b7d7911370ac662c6e787ef368","head":{"label":"kparzysz-quic:range-bind-types","ref":"range-bind-types","sha":"ed6b74f7313c99b7d7911370ac662c6e787ef368","user":{"login":"kparzysz-quic","id":48801706,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4ODAxNzA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48801706?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic","html_url":"https://github.com/kparzysz-quic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":621959892,"node_id":"R_kgDOJRJa1A","name":"tvm","full_name":"kparzysz-quic/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kparzysz-quic","id":48801706,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4ODAxNzA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48801706?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic","html_url":"https://github.com/kparzysz-quic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kparzysz-quic/tvm","description":"Open

https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/15233\r\n\r\nThis is the 2nd part of Milestone 1: Finish RuntimeManager for frameworks\r\n\r\nTo limit each PR in reviewable size, the Milestone 1 will be split into some steps:\r\nM1.1 Add translate && codegen for torch\r\n**M1.2 Add translate && codegen for tensorflow**\r\nM1.3 Add codegen for tensorrt\r\nM1.4 Add RuntimeManager and test with relax\r\nM1.5 Add RuntimeManager and test with torch\r\nM1.6 Add RuntimeManager and test with tensorflow\r\nM1.7 Add RuntimeManager and test with tensorrt\r\n\r\nTensorflow GraphDef will be translate to MSCGraph via relay. The codegen for tensorflow follow the same principle with relax codegen, thus generate the model define as well as test.\r\nAs mentioned in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/15645, MSC enables the relay based features. The test in this PR shows developers how to combine relay.frontend.from_tensorflow and msc.core.codegen.relay_to_relax to \"create\" a frontend for tensorflow in relax.\r\n\r\n@Hzfengsy \r\n@junrushao

`PatternRewriter` is intended to iterate until no matching patterns remain, as implemented in #14446 and #15495.  Prior to this commit, this only involved repeating the pattern match rewrite rules.  However, intermediate results produced by pattern replacement could cause the iterative pattern matching to terminate early.\r\n\r\n* If two rewrite rules each introduce the same intermediate, there will exist two copies of that intermediate, which can prevent `only_used_by` patterns from matching.  Applying `EliminateCommonSubexpr` allows the pattern matching to continue.\r\n\r\n* Applying a rewrite rule may result in dangling intermediates that are no longer used.  These dangling intermediates may prevent the next application of a rewrite rule that uses the `only_used_by` constraint.  Applying `RemoveAllUnused` allows the pattern matching to continue.\r\n\r\n* A rewrite rule that returns a `relax::Var` or `relax::TupleGetItem` as the replacement introduces trivial var-to-var rebinding, which are not tracked by `PatternRewriter`.  Applying `CanonicalizeBindings` allows the pattern matching to continue.\r\n\r\nWhile this could be fixed externally by repeatedly applying `rewrite_call`, this would require re-inspecting the entire function, and not just the dataflow block in which the replacement occurred.","created_at":"2023-10-09T20:45:07Z","updated_at":"2023-10-13T13:14:14Z","closed_at":"2023-10-13T12:04:31Z","merged_at":"2023-10-13T12:04:31Z","merge_commit_sha":"9725144bef4c544e453fa57e47cabece3c6906d2","assignee":{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi","html_url":"https://github.com/masahi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi","html_url":"https://github.com/masahi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15904/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15904/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/15904/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/001298d1cc0fa8a3688143b40ecddf0627b1d5eb","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:unity_improved_robustness_of_pattern_matching","ref":"unity_improved_robustness_of_pattern_matching","sha":"001298d1cc0fa8a3688143b40ecddf0627b1d5eb","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

PR adds helper functions to query system info from the LLVM backend.\r\nIt  enhances TVM target information handling and extends the CI coverage.\r\n\r\n---\r\n#### Changes:\r\n\r\n * Introduces ```llvm_get_system_cpu()```, ```llvm_get_system_triple()``` and ```llvm_get_system_x86_vendor()```\r\n * Exposes both C/FFI & PY interfaces for all the functions mentioned above with proper test cases.\r\n * Enhances CI test utils, removes old limiting checks  related to arch/system/cpu/vendor dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### Usage example\r\n```\r\n$ cat

to this commit, the `WellFormedInstrument` showed any error messages produced by the call to `relax.analysis.well_formed`, but did not show the ill-formed module itself.  Since this instrumentation is enabled for all unit tests in the `tests/python/relax` directory, CI logs do not include the failing module, making the logs less useful for debugging.\r\n\r\nThis commit

PR fixed two bugs:\r\n\r\n1. the KeyError: 'None' in the issue #15758\r\n2. nomalized_shape doesn't have the attribute values\r\n\r\nThe original code assigned `gamma` variable without a conditional check for None. So I added it. Additionally, the `shape_tuple` calculation for `gamma` and `beta` is modified to use `normalized_shape` directly instead of `normalized_shape.values`.\r\n\r\nPlease review and consider merging this PR. Thank you!\r\n@jikechao @Hzfengsy

to this commit, the `relax.transform.FuseTIR` transform required that the shapes arguments passed into a `PrimFunc` be structurally equivalent to the shapes of the parameters, and that any replacement of symbolic `tir.Var` be with a symbolic `tir.Var` in the fused function.\r\n\r\nThis commit updates the `SymbolicMatcher` to instead extract a `Map<tir::Var, PrimExpr>`.  As a result, a Relax tensor with statically-known shape can be passed into a TIR PrimFunc with dynamic shape.  The resulting fused TIR function is in terms of the statically-known shape, and no longer contains the symbolic variable.","created_at":"2023-10-06T21:07:38Z","updated_at":"2023-10-09T13:14:28Z","closed_at":"2023-10-09T13:14:25Z","merged_at":"2023-10-09T13:14:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"9f4d0fa5d37dfed3193dae29177c033435ef7130","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15883/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15883/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/15883/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/58ea1d9b1b3fee1b1a1052f413eebb2c6dc62390","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:unity_fuse_tir_with_static_calls_into_dynamic_primfunc","ref":"unity_fuse_tir_with_static_calls_into_dynamic_primfunc","sha":"58ea1d9b1b3fee1b1a1052f413eebb2c6dc62390","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

discussed in the October 3, 2023, community meeting, for cases like the `KVCache` in LLaMa in mlc-llm, it might be desirable to have a way to have packed calls inside dataflow blocks where the packed calls simply \"consume\" their output and mutate it in-place (performing no other side effects). While this is not pure, if the other conditions for doing an in-place call are met (no other live aliases of the consumed value), this is safe, though users should use caution if applying it. (The in-place update analyses could also be used to make sure the conditions are met.) This PR introduces a `call_inplace_packed` operator to signal this intent, though unlike `call_tir_inplace`, this operator really only conveys the intent—it is up to the implementation of the packed call to behave as it advertises.\r\n\r\n@psrivas2 raised the idea of having a different name, which may be worth discussing. We could consider using the word \"consume\" in it or referring to linear typing if we do not feel \"inplace\" conveys the intent well enough.","created_at":"2023-10-05T02:19:04Z","updated_at":"2023-10-09T13:35:27Z","closed_at":"2023-10-09T13:35:27Z","merged_at":"2023-10-09T13:35:26Z","merge_commit_sha":"dd575566606830925995875e8fed6d2bb2ac92c3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":5079055615,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBDeBdM8AAAABLrw8_w","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/branch:%20unity","name":"branch:

exists.","created_at":"2023-10-04T13:19:17Z","updated_at":"2023-10-10T15:16:18Z","closed_at":"2023-10-10T15:16:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"adebcd98b479e2f588a78ce2ed11d9a2c31316bf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15872/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15872/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/15872/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/324458e921d00e4ba1d9f9bbf478411ddb259240","head":{"label":"kparzysz-quic:autocorrect-range-types","ref":"autocorrect-range-types","sha":"324458e921d00e4ba1d9f9bbf478411ddb259240","user":{"login":"kparzysz-quic","id":48801706,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4ODAxNzA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48801706?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic","html_url":"https://github.com/kparzysz-quic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":621959892,"node_id":"R_kgDOJRJa1A","name":"tvm","full_name":"kparzysz-quic/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kparzysz-quic","id":48801706,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4ODAxNzA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48801706?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic","html_url":"https://github.com/kparzysz-quic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kparzysz-quic/tvm","description":"Open

to this commit, `relax.transform.LegalizeOps` needed to be called prior to `relax.build`.  This commit adds `LegalizeOps` to the lowering flow, to simplify the calling steps for an end-user.  If the `IRModule` contains no legalizable functions, a second legalization pass has no effect.\r\n\r\nSome test cases relied on this behavior as an implicit assertion that operator fusion patterns applied.  That is, by omitting `LegalizeOps`, a successful compilation `relax.build` would only occur if all legalizable operators have already been removed, and so an incorrect fusion pattern would result in a failure to build the module.  While these tests would be better expressed by comparing against an expected fused pattern, updating the tests is outside the scope of this PR.  To allow these tests to keep their implicit assertions, a `\"relax.transform.apply_legalize_ops\"` config can be used to disable the `LegalizeOps` pass.","created_at":"2023-10-03T16:35:54Z","updated_at":"2023-10-26T15:16:02Z","closed_at":"2023-10-26T15:15:59Z","merged_at":"2023-10-26T15:15:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"ebbe38f3281776cfda4fce0b188892ab1c5c7572","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15864/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15864/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/15864/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/d78b93249bbf2872a13fb31bf37d643879178507","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:unity_default_legalize_ops_when_building","ref":"unity_default_legalize_ops_when_building","sha":"d78b93249bbf2872a13fb31bf37d643879178507","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

to this commit, the `RewriteCUDAGraph` pass would unconditionally rewrite an `IRModule`, and was conditionally included as a lowering pass for used in `relax.build`, based on the current `PassContext`.  This commit moves the check on the `PassContext` from the `relax.build` method to the `RewriteCUDAGraph` pass itself.  This allows the pass to be part of a lowering flow that is constructed once, and is later used when the `PassContext.current()` may have changed.","created_at":"2023-10-03T15:39:06Z","updated_at":"2023-10-04T03:19:36Z","closed_at":"2023-10-03T23:27:44Z","merged_at":"2023-10-03T23:27:44Z","merge_commit_sha":"7d53953adc472ec2b1adf9cd91d77d900646f9b8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15861/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15861/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/15861/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/7fdff58ce1cd6e86390e79ed6a973fb16c3f93f8","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:unity_check_config_inside_cuda_graph_transform","ref":"unity_check_config_inside_cuda_graph_transform","sha":"7fdff58ce1cd6e86390e79ed6a973fb16c3f93f8","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

to this commit, if a relax variable were assigned to itself, through either `VarBinding` or `MatchCast` nodes, the two relax\r\nvariables would share the same register in the VM.  As a result, any upstream transform that deletes an object with `R.memory.kill_tensor` or `R.memory.kill_storage` must be aware of this VM behavior, and to only output one such instruction for each set of aliased registers.\r\n\r\nThis commit updates the VM to produce one register for each aliased relax variable.  The trivial bindings can be removed applying\r\n`relax.transform.CanonicalizeBindings`, instead of being implicitly de-duplicated at the codegen level.\r\n\r\nThis PR is a follow-up to https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/15854 with a better long-term solution, but which may have knock-on effects that must also be resolved.  In addition, this adds a usage example for the bug reported in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/15852, to avoid re-occurrence of similar issues.","created_at":"2023-10-02T17:17:42Z","updated_at":"2023-10-31T16:00:43Z","closed_at":"2023-10-31T16:00:39Z","merged_at":"2023-10-31T16:00:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"49a3a51ff1fd95f49a9e26f04bc0e730dfeb53f5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":858780915,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTg3ODA5MTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20need%20review","name":"status:

PR fixes the failed 0-rank rfactor test of TIR scheduling.\r\n\r\nThe reason of the failure is dtype mismatch. To be specific, when we declare a 0-rank buffer in TVM Script using `T.Buffer(shape=())`, the buffer's `elem_offset` field will be set to `T.int64(0)`, since we are unable to infer a dtype from the shape (which is 0-rank), and therefore the dtype falls back to int64.\r\n\r\nSo in this case, the declared 0-rank buffer before rfactor has `T.int64(0)` as `elem_offset`. Because the rfactor buffer is created from this buffer, the rfactor buffer also has `T.int64(0)` as `elem_offset`.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the rfactor buffer has shape `(128,)` which is not empty. So the expected buffer written in TVMScript has `T.int32(0)` as its `elem_offset`. And this causes the mismatch.\r\n\r\nAfter some thinking, I think the good way of fix is just to update the expected TIR, explicitly marks the `elem_offset` field to be `T.int64(0)` to avoid the mismatch. The reason is because the dtype of `elem_offset` here will not affect the behavior of lowering/codegen, and it is difficult to determine int64/int32 from a zero-rank buffer without any other context.","created_at":"2023-10-01T01:25:11Z","updated_at":"2023-10-02T03:22:30Z","closed_at":"2023-10-02T03:22:29Z","merged_at":"2023-10-02T03:22:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"d85ea256fa0d15d721599e4631b99cdef1eec9b8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":5079055615,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBDeBdM8AAAABLrw8_w","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/branch:%20unity","name":"branch:

torch.cat\r\n","created_at":"2023-09-30T18:07:56Z","updated_at":"2023-10-02T03:50:40Z","closed_at":"2023-10-02T03:50:40Z","merged_at":"2023-10-02T03:50:40Z","merge_commit_sha":"dd21ed37a89eabf53f60e83c1be99ef322a15a72","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15845/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15845/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/15845/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/0b5420c878f516dde07f9288a3fc4aea581377f9","head":{"label":"guoyaol:fix_torch_cat_concat","ref":"fix_torch_cat_concat","sha":"0b5420c878f516dde07f9288a3fc4aea581377f9","user":{"login":"guoyaol","id":57670095,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NjcwMDk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57670095?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoyaol","html_url":"https://github.com/guoyaol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoyaol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoyaol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoyaol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoyaol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoyaol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoyaol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoyaol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoyaol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoyaol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":626985646,"node_id":"R_kgDOJV8Krg","name":"tvm","full_name":"guoyaol/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"guoyaol","id":57670095,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NjcwMDk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57670095?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoyaol","html_url":"https://github.com/guoyaol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoyaol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoyaol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoyaol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoyaol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoyaol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoyaol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoyaol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoyaol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guoyaol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/guoyaol/tvm","description":"Open

to this commit, the last kernel launch would not be included in\r\na captured CUDA graph.  This commit updates `RewriteCUDAGraph` to\r\ninclude the last kernel launch.\r\n\r\nThe previous implementation assumed that any calls to\r\n`R.builtin.alloc_tensor` that remain after `StaticPlanBlockMemory` are\r\ndynamic allocations.  This is not the case, as the allocation of a\r\nstatic-shaped output tensor may still use `R.builtin.alloc_tensor`.\r\nThe primary change of this commit was to update `RewriteCUDAGraph` to\r\ncheck for static allocations directly, rather than inferring a static\r\nallocation based on the operation being used.\r\n\r\nThis change triggered an additional bug, in which the previous\r\nimplementation only checked for output variables if they occurred as\r\npart of a `VarBinding`, and not if they occurred as the body of a\r\n`SeqExpr`.  As a result, a captured CUDA graph whose output was\r\nimmediately used as the output of the containing Relax function would\r\ncontain an undefined variable.  This commit updates `RewriteCUDAGraph`\r\nto operate on a `SeqExpr` rather than a `BindingBlock`, so that the\r\n`SeqExprNode::body` may be inspected for output variables.","created_at":"2023-09-28T17:32:32Z","updated_at":"2023-09-29T15:07:16Z","closed_at":"2023-09-29T14:14:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8c035406f79d03be2264e115b9a3363c2769afe8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15839/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15839/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/15839/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/cbabe92176b1902663b1b165e721fd1a46268959","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:unity_consolidate_memory_releasing","ref":"unity_consolidate_memory_releasing","sha":"cbabe92176b1902663b1b165e721fd1a46268959","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

fMHA and Flash Attention can compute attention over batched sequences of variable sequence lengths in one kernel call. This is very useful for batched \"prefill\" attention in LLM workloads. vllm and TGI rely on such kernels to do prefill attention efficiently. \r\n\r\nTo support this, I introduced a new variant of `nn.attention` op that takes concatenated queries, values, and keys as input. In addition, sequence length information is encoded in a somewhat odd argument (`seqstart_q`). This arg is required by both CUTLASS fMHA and Flash Attention for the variable length mode, so it is a standard one.  \r\n\r\nThe test case demonstrates how to use and offload this op to CUTLASS for a typical batched prefill workload in LLM inference.\r\n\r\n@cyx-6 @vinx13 @MasterJH5574 @yelite @sunggg

as used by llama 2 70B and codellama 34B, is a common way to reduce runtime memory bandwidth for big LLMs. So far we haven't been taking advantage of this optimization: We do explicit `repeat` of KV tensors (https://github.com/mlc-ai/mlc-llm/blob/main/mlc_llm/relax_model/llama.py#L384-L385) and use the regular attention, which defeats the purpose of MQA.\r\n\r\nWhile CUTLASS fMHA doesn't support MQA (where `num_q_head != num_kv_head`), flash attention does support it. So I added a new option to `partition_for_cutlass` to enable pattern matching the `repeat` op during attention rewriting: When we detect an attention pattern where KV tensors are first expanded by `repeat`, we recognize it as MQA and dispatch it to flash attention. \r\n\r\nFor now this feature is opt-in, since it would force using flash attention for causal inference, but I haven't thoroughly validated its performance against such workloads. For example, even though flash attention v2 supports causal decoding inference where `seq_q_len = 1` as of https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention/commit/e07aa036db0e6cd251b17d9ee2d1720023da2def, cutlass fMHA can still be faster for such workloads. But based on feedback I can enable MQA offloading by default to avoid introducing another param.\r\n\r\nThat said, flash is definitely advantageous for MQA. For example, the following nvprof output for codellama 34B with 16k context length, using `repeat` and cutlass fMHA,  shows large overhead from repeat:  \r\n\r\n```\r\n Time (%)  Total Time (ns)  Instances  Avg (ns)   Med (ns)   Min (ns)  Max (ns)  StdDev (ns)                                                  Name            \r\n                                     \r\n --------  ---------------  ---------  ---------  ---------  --------  --------  -----------  ----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n------------------------------------ \r\n     30.5      21627490775      49152   440012.4   440224.0    420416    454336       3642.8  ampere_h16816gemm_64x64_sliced1x2_ldg8_stages_64x6_tn           \r\n                                     \r\n     22.0      15608458542      98304   158777.5   155791.0     85152    245310      69134.0  ampere_h16816gemm_128x64_sliced1x2_ldg8_relu_stages_64x6_tn     \r\n                                                                               \r\n     12.3       8753808009      99840    87678.4    87809.0     82080    103328       3242.2  repeat_kernel                                                   \r\n                                                                                                                                                              \r\n     11.1       7900613613       2304  3429085.8  1829756.5   1206877   7376321    2590665.8  ampere_h16816gemm_256x128_ldg8_stages_64x3_tn                   \r\n                                                                                                                                                              \r\n      8.1       5772286492      50192   115004.1   110656.0    102752    331968      30345.8  ampere_h16816gemm_64x64_sliced1x2_ldg8_stages_64x5_tn           \r\n                                                                                                                                                              \r\n      7.8       5541100467      49920   110999.6    93888.0     90080   1252571     135536.9  void attention_kernel_batched_impl<AttentionKer\r\n```   \r\n\r\nUsing flash attn MQA, the repeat overhead is completely gone and I get a few token / sec improvement due to this optimization.

our previous implementation, parameter sharding relies on pre-quantization weight processing, meaning each set of quantized weights corresponds strictly to a hardcoded constant `num_shards`, and re-quantization is strictly required upon each change of #GPUs, e.g. from 4-GPU to 8-GPU setting. This PR makes it possible to move parameter sharding to post-quantization loading-time. During loading, we iterate over all parameters and apply the sharding operation based on the provided sharding information.\r\n\r\nTo make this happen, this PR makes an enhancement to the existing `shard_info.json` to include the sharding function being used at loading time. Each parameter is attached to a list of loading-time preprocessing methods that are serially applied to it to transform this parameter to the desired shape, as shown in the example below:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nshard_info = {\r\n  \"x_0\": [ # name of the parameter\r\n    [ # a list of preprocessing functions to be applied\r\n      \"tests.disco.shard_dim_1\",  # name of the sharding function\r\n      [(num_shards, 64, 64), \"float16\"],  # output shape/dtype of `tests.disco.shard_dim_1`\r\n      num_shards,  # extra inputs to `tests.disco.shard_dim_1`\r\n    ],\r\n  ],\r\n  \"x_1\": [...],\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo parameter `x_0`, it means we will call method `tests.disco.shard_dim_1` which has the signature:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef shard_dim_1(\r\n  input: NDArray,\r\n  num_shards, # extra inputs\r\n  output: NDArray, # and its shape is (num_shards, 64, 64), and dtype is \"float16\"\r\n) -> None: ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis approach simplifies parameter sharding for users and ensures correctness.","created_at":"2023-09-26T21:30:42Z","updated_at":"2023-10-03T07:06:21Z","closed_at":"2023-10-03T07:06:21Z","merged_at":"2023-10-03T07:06:21Z","merge_commit_sha":"88a08ae47a10966f34a9218a92e20f66435f7540","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15826/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15826/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/15826/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/251e42aadfe0cbda7dde51d5c4aeaf8524c8883a","head":{"label":"LeshengJin:Disco/shard","ref":"Disco/shard","sha":"251e42aadfe0cbda7dde51d5c4aeaf8524c8883a","user":{"login":"LeshengJin","id":34279105,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0Mjc5MTA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34279105?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeshengJin","html_url":"https://github.com/LeshengJin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeshengJin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeshengJin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeshengJin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeshengJin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeshengJin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeshengJin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeshengJin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeshengJin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeshengJin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":603240240,"node_id":"R_kgDOI_S3MA","name":"tvm","full_name":"LeshengJin/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"LeshengJin","id":34279105,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0Mjc5MTA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34279105?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeshengJin","html_url":"https://github.com/LeshengJin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeshengJin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeshengJin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeshengJin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeshengJin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeshengJin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeshengJin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeshengJin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeshengJin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LeshengJin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/LeshengJin/tvm","description":"Open

to this commit, if `R.matmul` has arguments with an unknown datatype, it would produce an error from within the `R.call_te` implementation of `BlockBuilder.call_te`, stating `TVMError: cannot make const for type handle`.  While true, this is not the most easily interpreted error message.\r\n\r\nThis error message occurs due to the use of an unknown data type in Relax as a concrete data type in TE/TIR.  While Relax supports unknown datatypes, TIR does not.  When the Relax representation of an unknown datatype, `DataType::Void()`, is passed into TIR, this is interpreted as an opaque handle, which cannot have a scalar constant produced for it.\r\n\r\nThis commit validates the types being used in Relax, prior to generating the legalized implementation of `R.matmul`.  By catching the error earlier, the error message can be in terms of the Relax objects being used.","created_at":"2023-09-26T20:42:18Z","updated_at":"2023-09-27T19:47:52Z","closed_at":"2023-09-27T19:47:49Z","merged_at":"2023-09-27T19:47:49Z","merge_commit_sha":"1230b4009bac859b28853edaf9e7c478c3aa76a8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15825/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15825/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/15825/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/dab3bf96233f8288928ee4acc327bc87f6986458","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:unity_dtype_check_on_matmul_legalization","ref":"unity_dtype_check_on_matmul_legalization","sha":"dab3bf96233f8288928ee4acc327bc87f6986458","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

reverts commit 34637d7ee38f2636b1948548a39c15838d7a8db6.\r\n\r\nIt is better not visiting fields of buffer when visiting `MatchBufferRegion` since it's more common that the buffer is not mutated in `StmtMutator` (it can be left to the derived passes to handle case by case). It is also consistent with visitor/mutator for `BufferLoad` and `BufferStore` that do not visit buffer fields.\r\nThis fixes some broken tests in software pipelining where strides of some buffers in `MatchBufferRegion` are unintentionally mutated in-place.\r\n\r\ncc @yzh119 @tqchen @junrushao

to this commit, intermediate objects produced while executing a Relax function would persist until the end of the Relax function. While re-use of static allocations is handled by the `StaticPlanBlockMemory` transform, re-use of dynamic allocations is handled by the `relax_vm::PooledAllocator`.  For large Relax functions representing end-to-end model execution, releasing memory from the VM registers to the `relax_vm::PooledAllocator` at the end of the function call may be insufficient.\r\n\r\nThis commit introduces a new pass, `relax.transform.KillAfterLastUse`, which identifies the last usage of each Relax variable and inserts a `relax.memory.kill_tensor`, `relax.memory.kill_storage`, or `relax.vm.kill_object` call depending on the object type.  This insertion is suppressed if a Relax variables is already killed, such as static allocations and tensors tracked by `StaticPlanBlockMemory`.","created_at":"2023-09-22T21:47:48Z","updated_at":"2023-10-01T21:57:09Z","closed_at":"2023-09-28T13:54:23Z","merged_at":"2023-09-28T13:54:23Z","merge_commit_sha":"aa4587feb5103927d95e5e931149debd0a0aeafc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15810/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/15810/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/15810/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/ebc90a09df2583e5959657e92e154a5f36403692","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:unity_kill_after_last_use","ref":"unity_kill_after_last_use","sha":"ebc90a09df2583e5959657e92e154a5f36403692","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open
