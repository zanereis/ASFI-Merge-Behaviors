can get stuck in queued for a wide variety of reasons (e.g. celery loses\r\ntrack of a task, a cluster can't further scale up its workers, etc.), but tasks\r\nshould not be stuck in queued for a long time.\r\n\r\nOriginally, we simply marked a task as failed when it was stuck in queued for\r\ntoo long. We found that this led to suboptimal outcomes as ideally we would like \"failed\"\r\nto mean that a task was unable to run, instead of it meaning that we were unable to run the task.\r\n\r\nAs a compromise between always failing a stuck task and always rescheduling a stuck task (which could\r\nlead to tasks being stuck in queued forever without informing the user), we have creating the config\r\n`[core] num_stuck_reschedules`. With this new configuration, an airflow admin can decide how\r\nsensitive they would like their airflow to be WRT failing stuck tasks.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is an example of what it looks like after trying

Following are the changes.\r\n\r\n1. Made `only_new_ui_files` as an attribute that is true when there are any source files and they contain only new UI changes. Sometimes the PR has no source code changes so instead of diff on 2 empty sets this ensures there are source files and changes in new UI folder with no remaining files left. I am thinking of skipping db tests that now run with \"always\" that takes 2 mins down from 20 mins earlier but is not needed in new UI only PRs.\r\n2. `docs-build` flag is not used in the CI configuration causing docs build to always run that is not needed in new UI only PRs that don't change any user facing docs. Sometimes the build runs for an hour or more with intermittent failures and retry. This ensures to build docs only when needed. If there are scenarios where the flag is False with docs required then this could be improved.\r\n3. Integration tests are still executed since there is a default list of integrations.

now.","created_at":"2024-10-30T09:31:00Z","updated_at":"2024-10-31T07:23:31Z","closed_at":"2024-10-30T11:38:00Z","merged_at":"2024-10-30T11:38:00Z","merge_commit_sha":"6e547da7e0538a7c18721311ea0f75d5620af1ed","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"eladkal","id":45845474,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1ODQ1NDc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45845474?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal","html_url":"https://github.com/eladkal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"o-nikolas","id":65743084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NzQzMDg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65743084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas","html_url":"https://github.com/o-nikolas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1471852032,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDcxODUyMDMy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:amazon","name":"provider:amazon","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"AWS/Amazon

home page displays data interval start for next dagrun which might be confusing to users who are looking for next_dagrun_create_after which is when the next dagrun will be scheduled. There is a tooltip in the legacy UI. Similar tooltip can be added on hover to new UI as well for clarification.\r\n\r\nReview notes : \r\n\r\n* I would like to keep tooltip for UTC to be displayed on non-UTC timezones in `<Time />` and skip tooltip for next dagrun component since they collide with each other in UI. I tried to keep it as true by default and then pass `tooltip={false}` but eslint complains about this rule and removes it. I have disabled this rule only for the file. Maybe there is a better way to have this logic. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react/blob/master/docs/rules/jsx-boolean-value.md\r\n\r\n* I have named this as `DagRunInfo` but this is closely tied to next dagrun only for now with next_dagrun_create_after. Legacy UI also has tooltip for last dagrun. Maybe this could be updated after last dagrun info is updated in https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/43489 to pass data_interval_start, data_interval_end and next_dagrun_create_after as optional.

#43427\r\nrelated: #43427\r\n\r\n### What? \r\nWhen traces are enabled via otel traces config, the traces will ALWAYS be emitted to the configured host via the `OTLPSpanExporter`. (even if `otel_debugging_on` is set to `true`)\r\nIf debug is enabled via `otel_debugging_on`, the traces will be emitted to the console as well (via the `ConsoleSpanExporter`).\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\nWhen otel traces are configured and `otel_debugging_on` is set to `True`, the traces are only logged to the console and not emitted to the configured host. The current change allows the traces to be emitted to both the console and the host when \r\ndebug is enabled. \r\n\r\n### How? \r\nRemoved the debug check from the get_otel_tracer() function. The function now always sets the span exporter as `OTLPSpanExporter`. Shifted the debug check in the get_tracer() function, where the `ConsoleSpanExporter` is added to the span exporter only when debug is

PR is related to the upgrade of google-ads dependency. There is a new API version on Google Ads API and Google Ads API tends to deprecate too quickly. So we are trying to increase the dependency version to match with the latest version.\r\n\r\nSince we mostly use the types from the underlying library it is safe to upgrade. Also the users can give specific API version to override default value and use the previous API versions.\r\n\r\nHere is the \"Deprecation and sunset page\" of Google Ads API: https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/sunset-dates.\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

`retry_from_failure=True` is set, should only build models that failed in the previous run.\r\n## Why?\r\nThe problem is that if there is an error in one model that can't be resolved (e.g., due to a data source issue), the flag prevented the other models from being refreshed, even in subsequent scheduled runs.\r\n## How?\r\n- first run calls `{account_id}/jobs/{job_id}/run/`\r\n- next runs calls `{account_id}/jobs/{job_id}/rerun/`\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests. And in case of new features or big changes\r\nremember to adjust the documentation.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ping committers for the review!\r\n\r\nIn case of an existing issue, reference it using one of the following:\r\n\r\ncloses: #ISSUE\r\nrelated: #ISSUE\r\n\r\nHow to write a good git commit message:\r\nhttp://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/\r\n-->\r\n# Google Cloud Financial Services API Operators\r\n\r\nThis PR adds operators to interact with the [GCP Financial Services Anti-Money Laundering AI API](https://cloud.google.com/financial-services/anti-money-laundering/docs).\r\n\r\n## New Features\r\n\r\n### Hooks\r\n\r\n#### Financial Services Hook\r\n\r\n`providers/src/airflow/providers/google/cloud/hooks/financial_services.py` adds a hook for calling the Financial Services API. The methods implemented in this PR are [create](https://cloud.google.com/financial-services/anti-money-laundering/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.instances/create), [get](https://cloud.google.com/financial-services/anti-money-laundering/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.instances/get), and [delete ](https://cloud.google.com/financial-services/anti-money-laundering/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.instances/delete) on the [instances ](https://cloud.google.com/financial-services/anti-money-laundering/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.instances) endpoint.\r\n\r\nNote: To initialize the hook, the API discovery document must be provided as an argument in json format. This is because the Financial Services API is not currently publically General Available (customers must be allow-listed by Google), and requests to retrieve the discovery document require a developer key associated with that project. This discovery document does not contain any information beyond that already available from the public documentation and we have permission from a Google representative to check it in.\r\n\r\n### Operators\r\n\r\n#### Financial Services Create Instance Operator\r\n\r\n`providers/src/airflow/providers/google/cloud/operators/financial_services.py::FinancialServicesCreateInstanceOperator` can be used for airflow tasks that create a new Financial Services instance. This call creates a long-running operation and returns the name of the operation for monitoring.\r\n\r\n#### Financial Services Get Instance Operator\r\n\r\n`providers/src/airflow/providers/google/cloud/operators/financial_services.py::FinancialServicesGetInstanceOperator` can be used for airflow tasks that fetch an existing Financial Services instance. This call returns the instance resource data.\r\n\r\n#### Financial Services Delete Instance Operator\r\n\r\n`providers/src/airflow/providers/google/cloud/operators/financial_services.py::FinancialServicesDeleteInstanceOperator` can be used for airflow tasks that delete a Financial Services instance. This call creates a long-running operation and returns the name of the operation for monitoring.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Sensors\r\n\r\n#### Financial Services Operation Sensor\r\n\r\n`providers/src/airflow/providers/google/cloud/sensors/financial_services.py::FinancialServicesOperationSensor` can be used to monitor the status of Financial Services operations. The `poke` method access the `done` field of the operation and completes when `done=true`. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n\r\n### Unit Tests\r\nUnit tests added for the new hook, operator, and sensor features. \r\n\r\n### System Tests\r\nAn example DAG is added to the system tests directory. This DAG creates an instance, fetches the instance, and finally deletes it, with operation sensors for the create and delete operations. \r\n\r\nRunning the system test requires access to the Financial Services API. Some environment variables should also be set:\r\n- SYSTEM_TESTS_GCP_PROJECT\r\n- SYSTEM_TESTS_GCP_LOCATION\r\n- SYSTEM_TESTS_GCP_KMS_KEY\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes.

PR resolves an SQLAlchemy warning in the migration by correctly setting the `alias_id` column as part of the primary key in the `dag_schedule_dataset_alias_reference` table. Previously, only dag_id was marked as the primary key, causing a mismatch with the local definition, which triggered an SAWarning.\r\n\r\nExample: https://github.com/apache/airflow/actions/runs/11526187767/job/32090094094?pr=43243#step:6:745\r\n\r\nWhen running a migration you see this. It was missed in https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/41264:\r\n```\r\n/opt/airflow/airflow/migrations/versions/0026_2_10_0_dag_schedule_dataset_alias_reference.py:46 SAWarning: \r\nTable 'dag_schedule_dataset_alias_reference' specifies columns 'dag_id' as primary_key=True, not matching locally specified columns 'alias_id', 'dag_id'; setting the current primary key columns to 'alias_id', 'dag_id'. \r\nThis warning may become an exception in a future release\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is already a primary key in models:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/e9192f5db32e453f150c73ad31287d4953e3c43d/airflow/models/asset.py#L290-L291\r\n\r\nI verified that both columns are marked as primary keys already in 2.10.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"789\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d9fca23-7a95-4252-8cc6-71b876bb8c24\">\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

This change proproses overriding all `smtp_*` vars with the `Connection` object equivalents when `email.email_conn_id` is specified. However, this creates some a questions that need resolving/consensus.\r\n\r\n## Issue 1\r\nMy preference would be to use the `[smtp]` config vars as default/fallback values. However, this isn't possible as the connection UI doesn't allow for an 'not-specified' state for certain fields. \r\n\r\nE.g. the 'Disable SSL' checkbox defaults to `False` when not set, making it impossible to create a fallback condition. Attempting to implement a fallback leads to a state where the `smtp_ssl` config is ignored if the checkbox is checked, or the `smtp_ssl` config must be set to the desired value if the checkbox is unchecked. \r\n\r\n## Issue 2\r\n`[smtp]` configuration variables are become usable only for connections not requiring authentication. This effectively reverses the confusion I'm trying to address. I.e. `[smtp]` config vars would have no effect if `email_conn_id` is in play.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Possible solutions\r\n* Remove all `[smtp]` config vars duplicated by connection object. Effectively mandate that all smtp configuration is done via a `Connection` object. This requires the most changes.\r\n* Split `airflow.utils.email.send_email_smtp`  backend into `send_email_smtp` and `smtp_email_smtp_via_conn`. For this to work we'd need to revert #41539 and its deprecation, then auto-select backend based on presence of `email_conn_id`. Effectively states that if you want to use a `Connection` object to secure your SMTP params, you must configure the entirety of the SMTP connection using the object.\r\n* Introduct another config: `smtp.smtp_config_source=config|connection` and require the user to opt into desired behaviour. Allows the user to specify that all SMTP vars should be controlled by `Connection` object. Still leaves a confusing default state.\r\n* Modify the the connection UI to allow the user to clarify intent, thereby enabling the use of smtp config as fallback/default.\r\n  * Change checkboxes to Default/Yes/No. This currently isn't possible as `SelectField/RadioField` types aren't allowed in Connection Forms\r\n  * Provide No auth/user/pass checkbox to user to specify smtp doesn't require login.\r\n* Other ideas?\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

,\r\nchange-list:\r\n- in dags.gitSync , now it is possible to have multiple entries\r\n- changes in values.schema.json to amend the new schema for dags.gitSync.repositories\r\n- changes in check-values.yaml to check the below rules\r\n  - to check if duplicate repo and branch combinations are entered\r\n  - containerName should be unique in values.yaml for every entry in dags.gitSync.repositories\r\n- changes in _helpers.yml ( the helper function ) to accommodate multi-repo settings\r\n- changes in deployment yaml to support multirepo setting\r\n- changes in dags folder path so that symlink can be created for all repos\r\n- changes to support known-hosts and sshKey for multiple repos or branchs\r\n\r\n**This is a new feature which i have been working , i am ready to co-operate with all test-cases , below are the test cases i have performed**\r\n\r\nTest Cases | Expected Behaviour | Result\r\n-- | -- | --\r\nmultiple git-repo ( 2 Private and 1 Public ) | gitSync pulling from multiple repo or branch | PASSED\r\nmultiple git-repo ( 2 Private with ssh ) | gitSync pulling from multiple repo or branch | PASSED\r\nsingle git-repo | existing behavior should not be interrupted | PASSED\r\nmultiple duplicate entry in repositories section in dags | Should raise error while helm install | PASSED\r\nKnown-hosts for all repos | Known-hosts are listed in airflow.cfg for all repos | PASSED\r\n\r\n**Change Lists** : \r\n\r\nFile Name | Changes\r\n-- | --\r\ntemplates/NOTES.txt | Notes added for multirepo changes , it is just a Note\r\ntemplates/check-value.yaml | The Multirepo changes comes with some conditions -  <br>**1**. containerName in dags.gitSync for every repo in repositories list , should be unique  <br>**2**. whether user is providing duplicate input in the dags.gitSync.repolistories list\r\ntemplates/_helpers.yaml | Below are the changes - <br>**1**. create git-sync-init and git-sync container for every entry in the dags.gitSync.repositories list <br>**2**. create seperate volumeMounts and volumes for the ssh key and repo in dags.gitSync.repositories <br>**3**. create dags folder path for all entries in dags.gitSync.repositories <br>**4**. created a new helper to create symlink for every repo and call this helper in container ( scheduler , worker , triggerer , webserver , ..  ) in their lifecycle\r\ntemplates/scheduler/scheduler-deployment.yaml | changes to enlist all volumnes for all repos and as well as for sshKey , also in container lifecycle , helper airflow.dags_poststart has been called , so that it can create symlink for every repo , only after the git-sync is finished , to avoid any race-condition,\r\ntemplates/worker/worker-deployment.yaml | changes to enlist all volumnes for all repos and as well as for sshKey , also in container lifecycle , helper airflow.dags_poststart has been called , so that it can create symlink for every repo , only after the git-sync is finished , to avoid any race-condition,\r\ntemplates/webserver/webserver-deployment.yaml | changes to enlist all volumnes for all repos and as well as for sshKey , also in container lifecycle , helper airflow.dags_poststart has been called , so that it can create symlink for every repo , only after the git-sync is finished , to avoid any race-condition,\r\ntemplates/triggerer/triggerer-deployment.yaml | changes to enlist all volumnes for all repos and as well as for sshKey , also in container lifecycle , helper airflow.dags_poststart has been called , so that it can create symlink for every repo , only after the git-sync is finished , to avoid any race-condition,\r\ntemplates/secrets/git-ssh-key-secrets.yaml | changes in secrets , so that it can have secrets from multiple repos from dags.gitSync.repositories\r\ntemplates/dag-processor/dag-processor-deployment.yaml | changes to enlist all volumnes for all repos and as well as for sshKey , also in container lifecycle , helper airflow.dags_poststart has been called , so that it can create symlink for every repo , only after the git-sync is finished , to avoid any race-condition,\r\ntemplates/configmaps/configmap.yaml | changes to facilitate multiple known-hosts from dags.gitSync.repositories\r\nfiles/pod-template-file.kubernetes-hem-yaml | changes in volumne and container lifecycle to facilitate the multirepo changes\r\nvalues.yaml | introduced a new list element in dags.gitSync , this new list element named repositories which will have multiple entries of repos or branches\r\nvalues-schema.json | because a new element has been introduced in dags.gitSync , the schema.json is needed to be changed .\r\n\r\nThanks and

\r\nchange-list:\r\n- in dags.gitSync , now it is possible to have multiple entries \r\n- changes in values.schema.json to amend the new schema for dags.gitSync.repositories \r\n- changes in check-values.yaml to check the below rules \r\n  - to check if duplicate repo and branch combinations are entered\r\n  - containerName should be unique in values.yaml for every entry in dags.gitSync.repositories\r\n- changes in _helpers.yml ( the helper function ) to accommodate multi-repo settings\r\n- changes in deployment yaml to support multirepo setting \r\n- changes in dags folder path so that symlink can be created for all repos \r\n- changes to support known-hosts and sshKey for multiple repos or branchs  \r\n\r\nThis is a new feature which i have been working , i am ready to co-operate with all test-cases , below are the test cases i have performed \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTest Cases | Expected Behaviour | Result\r\n-- | -- | --\r\nmultiple git-repo ( 2 Private and 1 Public ) | gitSync pulling from multiple repo or branch | PASSED\r\nmultiple git-repo ( 2 Private with ssh ) | gitSync pulling from multiple repo or branch | PASSED\r\nsingle git-repo | existing

PR adds an operator for exporting from Google BigQuery's SQL result into Google Cloud Storage.\r\n\r\nThe original ‎[BigQueryToGCSOperator‎](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/providers/src/airflow/providers/google/cloud/transfers/bigquery_to_gcs.py) allows only full table movement, since is based on [insert job](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/f80233054c204eace74d54a90e5ae517a8548922/providers/src/airflow/providers/google/cloud/hooks/bigquery.py#L1644C9-L1644C19), which has no options to pass query.\r\n\r\nTo simplify the interface of the task (switching cases of full/sql exporting modes), the SQL-based case of BQ->GCS job is implemented as a separate one.\r\n\r\nThe exporting format might be different for BQ for different cases, so the `field_to_bigquery` and `convert_type` methods are implemented as easy overridable. The default output format is made to manual saving of BQ's result as local file.\r\n\r\nFor example, for the query:\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT\r\nTrue as _BOOL,\r\nCODE_POINTS_TO_BYTES([65, 98, 67, 100]) as _BYTES,\r\nDATE('0001-01-01') as _DATE,\r\nDATETIME('0001-01-01 00:00:00') as _DATETIME,\r\nJSON '{\"id\": 10,\"type\": \"fruit\",\"name\": \"apple\",\"on_menu\": true,\"recipes\":{\"salads\":[{ \"id\": 2001, \"type\": \"Walnut Apple Salad\" },{ \"id\": 2002, \"type\": \"Apple Spinach Salad\" }],\"desserts\":[{ \"id\": 3001, \"type\": \"Apple Pie\" },{ \"id\": 3002, \"type\": \"Apple Scones\" },{ \"id\": 3003, \"type\": \"Apple Crumble\" }]}}' as _JSON,\r\n-9223372036854775808 as _INT64,\r\ncast(-9.9999999999999999999999999999999999999E+28 as NUMERIC) as _NUMERIC,\r\ncast(-5.7896044618658097711785492504343953926634992332820282019728792003956564819968E+38 as BIGNUMERIC) as _BIGNUMERIC,\r\n1.0 as _FLOAT64,\r\n\"str\" as _STRING,\r\nTIME '12:30:00.45' as _TIME,\r\nTIMESTAMP '2014-09-27 12:30:00.45-08' as _TIMESTAMP\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `BigQueryToGCSOperator` output (exported as a table):\r\n```\r\n_BOOL,_BYTES,_DATE,_DATETIME,_JSON,_INT64,_NUMERIC,_BIGNUMERIC,_FLOAT64,_STRING,_TIME,_TIMESTAMP\r\ntrue,QWJDZA==,0001-01-01,0001-01-01 00:00:00,\"{\"\"id\"\":10,\"\"name\"\":\"\"apple\"\",\"\"on_menu\"\":true,\"\"recipes\"\":{\"\"desserts\"\":[{\"\"id\"\":3001,\"\"type\"\":\"\"Apple Pie\"\"},{\"\"id\"\":3002,\"\"type\"\":\"\"Apple Scones\"\"},{\"\"id\"\":3003,\"\"type\"\":\"\"Apple Crumble\"\"}],\"\"salads\"\":[{\"\"id\"\":2001,\"\"type\"\":\"\"Walnut Apple Salad\"\"},{\"\"id\"\":2002,\"\"type\"\":\"\"Apple Spinach Salad\"\"}]},\"\"type\"\":\"\"fruit\"\"}\",-9223372036854775808,-99999999999999999999999999999.999999999,-578960446186580977117854925043439539266.34992332820282019728792003956564819968,1,str,12:30:00.450,2014-09-27 20:30:00.45 UTC\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe cloud console's saving to file result (exported as query result):\r\n```\r\n_BOOL,_BYTES,_DATE,_DATETIME,_JSON,_INT64,_NUMERIC,_BIGNUMERIC,_FLOAT64,_STRING,_TIME,_TIMESTAMP\r\ntrue,QWJDZA==,0001-01-01,0001-01-01T00:00:00,\"{\"\"id\"\":10,\"\"name\"\":\"\"apple\"\",\"\"on_menu\"\":true,\"\"recipes\"\":{\"\"desserts\"\":[{\"\"id\"\":3001,\"\"type\"\":\"\"Apple Pie\"\"},{\"\"id\"\":3002,\"\"type\"\":\"\"Apple Scones\"\"},{\"\"id\"\":3003,\"\"type\"\":\"\"Apple Crumble\"\"}],\"\"salads\"\":[{\"\"id\"\":2001,\"\"type\"\":\"\"Walnut Apple Salad\"\"},{\"\"id\"\":2002,\"\"type\"\":\"\"Apple Spinach Salad\"\"}]},\"\"type\"\":\"\"fruit\"\"}\",-9223372036854775808,-99999999999999999999999999999.999999999,-578960446186580977117854925043439539266.34992332820282019728792003956564819968,1.0,str,12:30:00.450000,2014-09-27 20:30:00.450000 UTC\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe result of new `BigQuerySqlToGCSOperator` (with default `field_to_bigquery` and `convert_type` methods) is:\r\n```\r\n_BOOL,_BYTES,_DATE,_DATETIME,_JSON,_INT64,_NUMERIC,_BIGNUMERIC,_FLOAT64,_STRING,_TIME,_TIMESTAMP\r\ntrue,QWJDZA==,0001-01-01,0001-01-01T00:00:00,\"{\"\"id\"\":10,\"\"name\"\":\"\"apple\"\",\"\"on_menu\"\":true,\"\"recipes\"\":{\"\"desserts\"\":[{\"\"id\"\":3001,\"\"type\"\":\"\"Apple Pie\"\"},{\"\"id\"\":3002,\"\"type\"\":\"\"Apple Scones\"\"},{\"\"id\"\":3003,\"\"type\"\":\"\"Apple Crumble\"\"}],\"\"salads\"\":[{\"\"id\"\":2001,\"\"type\"\":\"\"Walnut Apple Salad\"\"},{\"\"id\"\":2002,\"\"type\"\":\"\"Apple Spinach Salad\"\"}]},\"\"type\"\":\"\"fruit\"\"}\",-9223372036854775808,-99999999999999999999999999999.999999999,-578960446186580977117854925043439539266.34992332820282019728792003956564819968,1.0,str,12:30:00.450000,2014-09-27 20:30:00.450000 UTC\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince usage of `schema` is property simplifies formatting of the output data, but might be defined only at the moment of query execution - this property behaves overridable also, to let user decide if it is ok or not to change the property's value on a fly.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.
