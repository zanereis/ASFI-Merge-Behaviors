SUMMARY\r\n\r\nA recent PR #17111 that fixed 500s being returned when a virtual table query contained a word prefixed by a colon (e.g. \":foo\") caused a regression that unnecessarily also escaped similar strings that contained/ended in a colon (e.g. \":foo:\" or \":foo:bar\"). \r\n\r\nThis PR simplifies the escaping logic by simply escaping all colons with a backslash when `sa.text` is used, as these elements are never expected to contain binds. In addition, an integration test is added that contains colons in the virtual table query, metric, filter and where clauses. The new test fails on current master with a 500.\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\nNow all strings including colons are displayed properly on the query:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/141433499-aa3558c2-e618-45c1-a501-d15fe16de0ac.png)\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\nBefore the virtual table was incorrectly escaped in multiple places:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/141433642-21f480e9-976a-411f-b148-62a33be56184.png)\r\n\r\n## TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nIt's somewhat typical to report for the current quarter (QTD) and currently the only way to do this is to define a broad time range and then add a custom SQL filter based on the current timestamp.\r\n\r\nThis request has been mentioned in a couple of Stack Overflow questions:\r\n\r\n- [How to MTD, YTD in Apache Superset?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49862866/how-to-mtd-ytd-in-apache-superset)\r\n- [how to set current quarter in Superset?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69043541/how-to-set-current-quarter-in-superset)\r\n\r\nMTD, YTD, etc. are supported via the sweet date parse logic‚Äîkudos to whoever added this functionality‚Äîusing the `datetrunc` functionality, thus I thought I should extend this to also include the `quarter` unit.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n<img

**Background** \r\nWhen we have worked on #16991 we wanted to test the new functionalities in concrete and accurate unittest.\r\nAll chartData flows and its components are too couple to superset so it is impossible to create unittests. \r\nThe flows are not testable and so many components do not meet the very important principle SRP and the code became so dirty \r\n\r\nSo I've started to refactor it (#17344 ) but many changes were added and it was hard to review so I decided to split those changes into small PRs so will be easier to follow \r\n\r\nThis is the fourth PR in a sequence of PRs to meet these\r\nThe Next PR is #17425 \r\n\r\n## PR description\r\nIn #17400, ChartData endpoints were moved to a new view, so the tests should move too. \r\n\r\nWhat else?\r\n1. Improve tests setup - it doesn't sense each test will do the same setup instead in one place, \r\n2. improve get_query_contexe setup - it doesn't sense that each test will force call the database over and over. so now it will call the DB once and create a query context template. Then each test will copy the query context template. \r\n4. Advance another one step further into using pytest without unittest coupling \r\n5. improve test cases names so it will be clear what the test is done and expected. \r\n\r\n### Test plans \r\nshould we test the tests? :) \r\n\r\n\r\n## Previous PRs\r\n1. #17399\r\n2. #17400 \r\n3. #17405

**Background** \r\nWhen we have worked on #16991 we wanted to test the new functionalities in concrete and accurate unittest.\r\nAll The chartData flows and its components are too couple to superset so it is impossible to create unittests. \r\nThe flows are not testable and so many components do not meet the very important principle SRP and the code became so dirty \r\n\r\nSo I've started to refactor it (#17344 ) but many changes were added and it was hard to review so I decided to split those changes into small PRs so will be easier to follow \r\n\r\nThis is the third PR in a sequence of PRs to meet these\r\nThe next PR is #17407 \r\n\r\n## PR description\r\nThe CharaDataCommand responsible is to retrieve data given query context parameters.\r\nWhat it needs is query_context injected to him so it can fulfill its task. Loading the query_contxt form from the cache is another responsible, thus should be in another module to meet the SRP principle. \r\nThe module that is responsible for creating the DataChartCommand and injecting what the command needs, should charge for calling the cache loader. \r\n\r\nmore small changes:\r\nadd \"_\" prefix to methods name that supposed to be private and remove unused code\r\n\r\n### Test plans \r\nThere are no logic changes, the way the cache is loading is the same as was in the command so new tests are not required  \r\n\r\n\r\n## Previous PRs\r\n1. #17399\r\n2. #17400

**Background** \r\nWhen we have worked on #16991 we wanted to test the new functionalities in concrete and accurate unittest.\r\nAll chartData flows and its components are too couple to superset so it is impossible to create unittests. \r\nThe flows are not testable and so many components do not meet the very important principle SRP and the code became so dirty \r\n\r\nSo I've started to refactor it (#17344 ) but many changes were added and it was hard to review so I decided to split those changes into small PRs so will be easier to follow \r\n\r\nThis is the second PR\r\nThe next PR is #17405 \r\n\r\n\r\n## PR description\r\nCreate new view - ChartDataRestApi in new module but inherit ChartRestApi \r\nthen moves all chart data endpoints to that new view so the view will be focused only on chartData \r\n\r\n### Test plans \r\nThere are no logic changes so new tests are not required \r\nbut in the next PRs, I'll split the API tests into new separate modules and classes \r\n\r\n##

**Background** \r\nWhen we have worked on #16991 we wanted to test the new functionalities in concrete and accurate unittest.\r\nAll chartData flows and its components are too couple to superset so it is impossible to create unittests. \r\nThe flows are not testable and so many components do not meet the very important principle SRP and the code became so dirty \r\n\r\nSo I've started to refactor it (#17344 ) but many changes were added and it was hard to review so I decided to split those changes into small PRs so will be easier to follow \r\n\r\nthis is the First PR\r\nThe next PR is #17400 \r\n\r\n### PR description\r\nMoving ChartDataResultType and ChartDataResultFormat from utils to common.\r\nthink about it those are not utils and used by many places so it more sense to be in common \r\n\r\n### test plans \r\nThere are no logic change so new tests are not required

SUMMARY\r\n\r\n**Short Summary:**\r\n\r\nRemoved the tooltip hover for tables that are not truncated\r\n\r\nChanged tooltip popup to be centered over the table name\r\n\r\n**Detailed Summary:**\r\n\r\nThis was done by adding a reference to the StyledSpan which is the element that had the styling to truncate when the table name text overflows.\r\n\r\nThen when the component mounts, we check if the element is overflowing and if so remove the tooltip trigger that shows the tooltip pop up.\r\n\r\nWe did that by passing an empty array to the ToolTip trigger property instead of ['hover']. Doing this makes it so the tooltip never triggers and therefore never shows up.\r\n\r\nI changed the tooltip to show up over the center of the name because it looked a little weird to have it placed on the left when the table name was so long. I might be the only one who feels that way, so please let me know if anybody disagrees and I will change it back.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE \r\n![TableElementBefore](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31329271/141012989-744fcf96-36e4-4d5b-b0e1-1e0c706f2830.gif)\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\n![TableElementAfter](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31329271/141013014-14692eef-1014-4aba-8211-33d075a9e4e9.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nOpen Superset and select the SqlEditor option under SQL Lab at the top of the screen\r\n\r\nOn the left side of the screen select some schema and add some tables with the table schema dropdown\r\n\r\nIf you know where to find some tables with long enough names that it causes the name to truncate then open up some of those and then hover your mouse over the table names and observe.\r\n\r\nIf you are like me and you do not know where to find super long table names you can add a little bit of code at the file located here `superset-frontend/src/SqlLab/components/SqlEditorLeftBar/index.jsx`\r\n\r\nThen we hop on down to line 213 and we can copy-paste this little map method in between `this.props.tables` and `.map`\r\n\r\n`.map((table, i) => {\r\n                  if (i % 2 == 0) return table;\r\n                  return {\r\n                    ...table,\r\n                    name:\r\n                      table.name +\r\n                      'this_is_a_really_really_really_really_long_name',\r\n                  };\r\n                })\r\n`\r\n\r\nAll this does is appends a really long string to the end of every other table name. You should remove this after visually testing.\r\n\r\nShould go from this:\r\n<img width=\"443\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-11-09 at 4 11 54 PM\"

long.\r\n\r\nFinally, you can observe the lack of tooltip on the short names and bear witness to the tooltip popup on the long ones.\r\n\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis is a partial revert of https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/17236 as it seems other chart types: all ECharts, [Bar Chart](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/15318), etc. already perform an implicit ordering if undefined, i.e., the ship has sailed on this one‚Äîpreviously I wasn't aware just how prevalent the behavior was and thus the fallback seems like the rule rather than the exception. I also added updated comments to reflect this behavior.\r\n\r\nPersonally I'm a tad upset/frustrated that this behavior differs by chart type (search for `sort_by` in [viz.py](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset/viz.py)) as this simply adds confusion to the user and leads to a very inconsistent UX. When we introduce new behaviors we should:\r\n\r\n1. Strive to make them consistent throughout.\r\n2. Indicate said changes in `UPDATING.md` so institutions can inform/educate users of said changes. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThere was a concern that there were TOO MANY chunks generated by webpack. This PR undoes some custom \"vendors\" chunking, instead going with Webpack's default of grouping shared modules in `node_modules`. The result? One Giant Chunk! This might take the browser longer to parse, but it might be more highly cached, and reduce loading when moving around between Superset's react apps. All in all, it removes about 100 other chunk files. We could set a max chunk size and break it down into a few for parallel loading, but right now, this PR is more of a discussion point.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nBundle analyzer screengrabs to come...\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

we tried to link superset-ui/core to main superset codebase, there was an error related to theme fields being undefined. After some investigation it turned out that the culprit was the `theme` used in `css` prop. `css` emotion prop is enabled by a babel preset `@emotion/babel-preset-css-prop`. \r\nFor some reason we used the preset only in tests - this PR moves it to general presets.\r\nRelated PR: https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui/pull/1458\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nUsing changes from this

\"Single Value\" in the advanced section.  This will reveal 3 single value type options supporting the following behaviors:\r\n\t* Minimum: Filter values greater than or equal to the selected value on the range slider.\r\n\t* Exact: Filter values equal to the selected value on the range slider.\r\n\t* Maximum: Filter values less than or equal to the selected value on the range slider.\r\n\t\r\nIf \"Single Value\" is not checked, the previous default range slider behavior applies.\r\nIf \"Single Value\" is checked and Minimum is chosen, the slider should support a single thumb sliding from the right hand side of the control.\r\nIf \"Single Value\" is checked and Exact is chosen, the slider should support a single thumb sliding in the middle of the control with no highlighted range displayed.\r\nIf \"Single Value\" is checked and Maximum is chosen, the slider should support a single thumb sliding from the left hand side of the control.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\"

SUMMARY\r\nSome columns such as the ones representing a complex structure (array, struct, enum or a combination of these) may require more than 32 chars to store the datatype. Changing datatype to TEXT and no limit was suggested by @villebro in the 1st associated issue listed below.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore: \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62111795/140554250-c6a289ea-4952-45bc-bada-df85f8531fc5.png)\r\nAfter:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62111795/140554304-507a9ae2-7c09-4733-97ee-4cb7e29e3786.png)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nAfter the migration, easiest way to test is to edit an existing dataset and change the type value of a column (using the legacy datasource editor) to something larger than 32 characters, Superset should accept the change and confirm the row was changed in the database. \r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [X] Has associated issue:\r\n *

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nCurrently `<DeleteModal/>` does not clear the \"delete\" confirmation after a deletion. This means that:\r\n\r\n1. User selects charts using \"bulk select\"\r\n2. User clicks \"DELETE\"\r\n3. User types \"delete\" to confirm\r\n4. Charts are deleted\r\n5. User selects more charts using \"bulk select\"\r\n6. User clicks \"DELETE\"\r\n7. The modal shows up with the \"delete\" confirmation is already populated!\r\n\r\nI changed the component so that the text in the `<Input/>` component is managed, clearing it when the modal is hidden or after a delete.\r\n\r\nI also changed it so that users can press \"return\" to delete, once they've confirmed, instead of forcing users to click the button.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1534870/140426241-e6f3f858-99b6-40a6-882a-02308bf78bda.mov\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1534870/140426287-8115edf8-b4a9-476d-883b-9613c36fa817.mov\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nIt was possible for short period of time to save an invalid timezone value (GMT Standard Time) in the reports schedule, which was causing errors and failures when running the cron job. With this change, I am catching any cron errors with regard to the timezone function and defaulting to UTC. I also added timezone validation when creating a report. \r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nunit and integration tests have been updated. To manually test, you should be able to create and run a report with a timezone. You should not be able to create a report with a bad timezone. \r\n\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR adds a key-value store endpoint for Superset with secure key generation and management of store entries. \r\n\r\nKeys are generated on the server-side using the https://docs.python.org/3/library/secrets.html#secrets.token_urlsafe function and the value can be any JSON supported text.\r\n\r\nEach value can have an associated duration.  A Celery cleanup task is responsible for managing expired entries in the key-value store. \r\n\r\nThe user can also set a configuration to reset the duration upon retrieval to preserve actively accessed entries. \r\n\r\nThis endpoint can be used to solve a bunch of uses cases for Superset. Each client of this endpoint should carefully consider security, normalization, and ownership implications when deciding to store some type of information into the key-value store. Some possible use cases for this endpoint are listed below:\r\n- Profiles, preferences, and configurations management\r\n- Large objects storage (URL parameters, application state, drafts, etc)\r\n- Caching\r\n\r\nWe currently have an endpoint at `/kv/store`, but it has serial/monotonic ids which allow a user to iterate through other people‚Äôs saved states. That endpoint is also using the deprecated API system on `superset/views`, so it would need to be refactored anyway. Another important point is that the `/kv/store` endpoint does not contain any management capabilities regarding entries duration, ownership, and creation timestamps, which makes automatic sanitization harder.\r\n\r\nThe security model of the entry point is inspired by the Google Drive sharing model and it‚Äôs intended to support similar use cases. By default, any added value to the key-value store is accessible only to the user who created the value. This can be altered using the `anyone_with_key`, `editor_*`,  and `viewer_*` configurations. The `anyone_with_key` option accepts the `editor` and `viewer` values indicating that anyone with the key can edit or view the store value. This is useful when storing non-sensitive information that needs to be shared among users. The `editor_*` and `viewer_*`  configurations allow specific access restrictions to the key-value entries like granting read or write permissions to specific users or roles. In the case of access configuration conflicts, the more restrictive rule should always apply. An example would be `anyone_with_key: ‚Äòeditor‚Äô` and `editor_users: [1, 2, 3]`. In this case, only users 1, 2, and 3 would have editor access. \r\n\r\nHere's a pseudo-code of the endpoint operations and their configurations. For the complete status codes and possible responses check the Swagger documentation:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPOST `api/v1/key_value_store`\r\n\r\nBODY \r\n{\r\n   // The duration of the value in the key

you wish to expire unused values but keep the ones that are actively retrieved.\r\n   // True by default\r\n   reset_duration_on_retrieval?: <boolean>,\r\n\r\n   // Any type of JSON supported text.\r\n   value: <string>,\r\n\r\n   // Anyone with the key can edit or view the store value\r\n   anyone_with_key?: <'editor', 'viewer'>\r\n\r\n   // IDs of the users with editor access\r\n

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\n`sqlparse` fails to identify this query as a `SELECT`:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nWITH foo AS(\r\nSELECT\r\n  FLOOR(__time TO WEEK) AS \"week\",\r\n  name,\r\n  COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS \"unique_users\"\r\nFROM \"druid\".\"my_table\"\r\nGROUP BY 1,2\r\n)\r\nSELECT\r\n  f.week,\r\n  f.name,\r\n  f.unique_users\r\nFROM foo f\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis happens because `AS(` (no space) is identified as a function, and because of that the statement has type \"UKNOWN\".\r\n\r\nI improved the logic in `is_select` so that when the token is \"UNKNOWN\" we check for DDL and DML, returning true only if there's no DDL and the only DML is a `SELECT`.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not

SUMMARY\r\nUpdate all deps to most recent versions on `superset-websocket` to resolve audit warnings. The `client-ws-app` is also bumped to the most recent package versions, including migrating `jade` to `pug` (the project was renamed in 2016 when pug 2 was released). Some tests and type declarations are updated to fix typing errors.\r\n\r\nAfter update `npm run test` passed and running Superset with Global Async Queries with websocket server worked as expected.

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\ncloses: https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/15132\r\nCurrently, we use `@memorized` decorator to cache function results in memory. Obviously, the original decorator does not consider:\r\n1. how to release memory in the application process\r\n2. how to define cache size\r\n\r\nIn this PR:\r\n1. I used a simple`functools.lru_cache` wrapper replaced with original `memorized`.\r\n2. ~~I used `memoized_func` replaced with `memoized` when need to define a custom cache key.~~ pickle cannot serialize SQLAlchemy engine object, raise an error ```TypeError: can't pickle _thread._local objects```, so we we can't use memoized_func to cache this function\r\n3. because `functools.lru_cache` can't support customized cache-key, add a minor proxy function to delegate `get_sqla_engine` function \r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThe migration in https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/16756 is failing in MySQL 8. Renaming the column `dbs.allow_csv_upload` fails because there's a check constraint on it.\r\n\r\nThis seems to be a known bug (https://github.com/sqlalchemy/alembic/issues/699), and from that thread dropping the constraint seems safe. The problem is that existing installations already have the constraint, so we can't add `create_constraint=False` to boolean columns in the model.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the migration by explicitly dropping the check constraint if it exists, and renaming the column after.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n\r\nInstall Superset using a MySQL 8 database. The `superset db upgrade` step will fail on the migration `b92d69a6643c_rename_csv_to_file.py`.\r\n\r\nWith this PR, the check constraint is dropped and the migration succeeds.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL

apache/superset#16318 per the comments left in the original PR. \r\n\r\nNote I think the intent of the original change is good however it's somewhat nuanced and  it was not apparent to the user from the UI that the grouping was being mutated. It does seem a preferred solution is either the addition of custom columns or UI components which allows users to opt in to which temporal columns should be transformed by the time grain. Furthermore said change was actually a breaking change but was not protected with a feature

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis PR is one of a slew to the [apache/superset](https://github.com/apache/superset) and [apache-superset/superset-ui](https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui) repos to revert pseudo recent changes to the series restrictions for high cardinality groupings. For more context please refer to [this](https://apache-superset.slack.com/archives/G013HAE6Y0K/p1635192289021500) Slack thread in the #committers channel.\r\n\r\nSpecifically this PR reverts https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/15343 (and more), i.e., does not fallback to the first selected metric and requires the user to specify a sort-by metric for improved UX, i.e., it was not apparent to the user from the UI how the sorting was happening. Furthermore said change was actually a breaking change but was not protected with a feature flag.\r\n\r\nInitially I added logic for an XOR check that required either neither or both the series sort-by and limit needed to be provided, but this would be a breaking change‚Äîin addition to thinking about how this should work with the table row limit‚Äîand thus I felt this would be better handled at a later stage.\r\n\r\nRelated PRs:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui/pull/1430\r\n- https://github.com/apache-superset/superset-ui/pull/1436\r\n\r\n### TESTING

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently it's possible to create annotations and annotation layers via the API that cause the frontend to crash. For instance, by defining an annotation layer with a `null` name, the edit window crashes with the following error:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/138882496-2eef7081-2bda-4d7a-b63f-bd66e7cd8445.png)\r\n\r\nAlso, editing a previously created annotation where the `json_metadata` field had been unset (`null`), trying to save the annotation resulted in the following error:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/138892311-3d08775c-ce9a-4831-8a96-87ecc3ce82b3.png)\r\n\r\nThis PR updates both the annotation layer and annotation marshmallow schemas to require the minimum amount of defined or non-null values. Note that when leaving out a property on a PUT request, the original object leaves the omitted values untouched, hence a very permissive schema for PUT operations (no required fields). In addition, the frontend logic is updated to no longer crash if an object that was created prior to this PR is edited.\r\n\r\nTest cases are added to all relevant permutations of allowed and incorrect POST/PUT payloads. Affected API tests are also updated to correspond to the new minimum requirements.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes
