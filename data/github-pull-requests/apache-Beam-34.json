error in prism's fusion handling. Re-instates fusion.\r\n\r\nInstead of passing the consuming transform ID to get the downstream side inputs, we passed the PCollection ID, causing the computation to fail. Ultimately, the hangs were because there was a stage that depended on it's own produced side input.\r\n\r\nAdds unit sufficient testing to avoid replicating the issue, and fixes the issue.\r\nExported fields on `link` and `fusionFacts` types to let them be compared for diffs by cmp. \r\nAdds additional debug logging for the resulting hang that was occurring.\r\n\r\n(Long due to the unit tests, and necessary renames, the actual fix is a single line that I've commented to point out.)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAddendum: There was another bug in prism that when combined with fusion prevented one of the xlang tests from passing. In particular, the combiner lifting handler was not removing subtransforms recursively from lifted combines, leading to additional transforms being left in the graph.\r\n\r\nThis caused some interesting downstream mayhem: multiple producers for a single pcollection (pcollections only have one producer), and incorrect fusions, leading to the runner to hang, but *only* for certain topological orderings.\r\n\r\nA unit test was added for the combine handler to validate the fix. \r\nPrism has also been made a bit more eager to fail when  it gets into those bad states, in particular when it notices that there is outstanding data to process, but nothing that would trigger it. Now prism crashes, which avoids indefinite hangs and timeouts.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nAddendum 2.\r\n\r\nFixed a race condition in the pubsubx test, causing flakes.\r\nFixed an extra t.Run wrapping in the fileio.Match tests, which i assume caused flakes somehow.\r\n\r\nUpdated prisms bundle execution to use an errgroup to manage bundle failures, context cancellation, and limit parallelism, simplifying that code. This better addresses flakey handling of failures and pipeline completion.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

now, side inputs were handled separately from most of the data handling, leading to\r\nthem remaining un-garbage-collected, leading to a memory leak for long running streaming pipelines. This PR resolves that by moving Side Input Data handling into the elementmanager, which allows the data to be GCd once the output watermark for a stage has moved beyond where a given window's side input could be referenced.\r\n\r\nAs a refresher: A transform T with a side input S, can only access data from S that is in the Same Window W as a given Element. This is what gives the \"blocking\" behavior of side inputs for consumers. On the other side, the side input can thus be cleaned up if there's no data that remains to be processed by T, that can be projected onto W.\r\n\r\nNecessary precursor to add state and timers in #28543, which has the same garbage collection behavior WRT a stages watermark.\r\n\r\nBonus changes:\r\n* Annotated some coder look up errors in the SDK's execution bundle translation, to clarify what was actually failing. The issue that needed this debugging was due to removing the calls that added the coders to the bundle's components.\r\n* Removed some extra map nesting around side inputs.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

does 4 things:\r\n1) Updates the snapshot job to use multi-arch images\r\n2) Updates the docker plugin to allow pushing tags with the normal push action. This was needed because multiarch images can't be saved locally, so they need to be tagged/pushed in one step\r\n3) Disables provenance (`--provenance=false`) for buildx jobs. This is what was leading to the extra containers and was just adding metadata about the container - https://docs.docker.com/build/attestations/slsa-provenance/ - which we don't need\r\n4) Updates the stale container script to not delete containers that have dependencies described in their manifest that shouldn't be deleted. This ensures that multiarch containers published with a creation time at the start of the epoch don't get deleted. Note that this creation time is a gcr bug for multiarch containers, not caused by something we're doing, so this behavior may eventually go away.\r\n\r\nExample run - https://github.com/apache/beam/actions/runs/6894556931\r\n\r\nProduced https://pantheon.corp.google.com/gcr/images/apache-beam-testing/global/beam-sdk/beam_java17_sdk@sha256:6b975bcc610262384d66c3175dd30e9e272455e6317c87d9114d2b24a60cab3c/details?e=13802955&mods=logs_tg_prod link for example\r\n\r\nFixes #29341\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

noticed a consistent increase in Kafka consumer lag, especially with topics that had higher message traffic when we use Flink Runner. Our investigation revealed that the lag was related to how Apache Beam's **UnboundedSourceWrapper** and **KafkaUnboundedReader** were handling Kafka partitions. We found that for topics with lower traffic, the processing thread would wait unnecessarily, causing a lag in processing higher traffic topics. To address this We created adaptive timeout on KafkaUnboundReader. \r\n\r\nMore detailed explanation done by Intuit team also too.

introduced several test failures. However, I would argue a forward fix because these failures was due to existing problem of build.gradle get revealed\r\n\r\n- Fixes #29386 . It get revealed because these test were missed previously, and then exposes a problem in runner-cloud-dataflow-java/example/build.gradle that is affected by #19191. It was not found during the work of #29353 because I use a custom tempLocation so the default (having a trailing slash) was not used.\r\n- Fixes `./gradlew :buildSrc:spotlessApply`.  Apparently `./gradlew spotlessCheck` does not run buildSrc's spotless check, nor `./gradlew spotlessApply` applies to buildSrc. #29353 introduced spotless violation that not caught by beam precommit test, and failing internal tests on import. This may originate from gradle timing.\r\n- Fixes ARM tests failing at clean up container image. Previously ARM test do not clean up container image after test run, causing leaked resources.\r\n\r\n**Please** add a meaningful description for your change here\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Most values can be replaced via parameters, but [parameters cannot be used for identifiers](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/parameterized-queries).

of the effort of reducing the concurrent Dataflow jobs in precommit stage to reasonable level\r\n\r\nFound that several postcommit jobs have \"Push\" trigger, while most does not. This PR then removes all push trigger except for precommit workflows. It also removes issue_comment trigger for remaining loadtest/performance test. Also in current practice we barely monitor push triggers.\r\n\r\n**Please** add a meaningful description for your change here\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
